atlanta () is the capital and most populous city in the u.s. state of georgia. with an estimated 2018 population of 498,044, it is also the 37th most-populous city in the united states. the city serves as the cultural and economic center of the atlanta metropolitan area, home to 5.9 million people and the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the nation. atlanta is the seat of fulton county, the most populous county in georgia. a small portion of the city extends eastward into neighboring dekalb county.
atlanta was originally founded as the terminating stop of a major state-sponsored railroad. with rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point between multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. the city's name derives from that of the western and atlantic railroad's local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub. during the american civil war, the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in general william t. sherman's famous march to the sea. however, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the "new south". during the 1950s and 1960s, atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with dr. martin luther king jr., ralph david abernathy, and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership. during the modern era, atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub, with hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport being the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.
atlanta is rated as a "beta(+)" world city that exerts a moderate impact on global commerce, finance, research, technology, education, media, art, and entertainment. it ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product (gdp) of $385 billion. atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors that include transportation, logistics, professional and business services, media operations, medical services, and information technology. atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage, earning it the nickname of "the city in a forest." revitalization of atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 summer olympics, has intensified in the 21st century, altering the city's demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.
prior to the arrival of european settlers in north georgia, creek indians inhabited the area. standing peachtree, a creek village where peachtree creek flows into the chattahoochee river, was the closest indian settlement to what is now atlanta. as part of the systematic removal of native americans from northern georgia from 1802 to 1825, the creek were forced to leave the area in 1821, and white settlers arrived the following year.
in 1836, the georgia general assembly voted to build the western and atlantic railroad in order to provide a link between the port of savannah and the midwest. the initial route was to run southward from chattanooga to a terminus east of the chattahoochee river, which would then be linked to savannah. after engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven into the ground in what is now five points. a year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as "terminus", and later "thrasherville" – after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area. by 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed "marthasville" to honor governor wilson lumpkin's daughter martha. later, j. edgar thomson, chief engineer of the georgia railroad, suggested the town be renamed "atlanta". the residents approved, and the town was incorporated as atlanta on december 29, 1847.
by 1860, atlanta's population had grown to 9,554. during the american civil war, the nexus of multiple railroads in atlanta made the city a hub for the distribution of military supplies. in 1864, the union army moved southward following the capture of chattanooga and began its invasion of north georgia. the region surrounding atlanta was the location of several major army battles, culminating with the battle of atlanta and a four-month-long siege of the city by the union army under the command of general william tecumseh sherman. on september 1, 1864, confederate general john bell hood made the decision to retreat from atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the union army. on the next day, mayor james calhoun surrendered atlanta to the union army, and on september 7, sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. on november 11, 1864, sherman prepared for the union army's march to the sea by ordering the destruction of atlanta's remaining military assets.
after the civil war ended in 1865, atlanta was gradually rebuilt. due to the city's superior rail transportation network, the state capital was moved from milledgeville to atlanta in 1868. in the 1880 census, atlanta surpassed savannah as georgia's largest city.
beginning in the 1880s, henry w. grady, the editor of the "atlanta constitution" newspaper, promoted atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "new south" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. by 1885, the founding of the georgia school of technology (now georgia tech) and the atlanta university center had established atlanta as a center for higher education. in 1895, atlanta hosted the cotton states and international exposition, which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the new south's development to the world.
during the first decades of the 20th century, atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. in three decades' time, atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. the city's skyline emerged with the construction of the equitable, flatiron, empire, and candler buildings; and sweet auburn emerged as a center of black commerce. the period was also marked by strife and tragedy. increased racial tensions led to the atlanta race riot of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured. in 1913, leo frank, a jewish-american factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. he was hanged in marietta by a lynch mob in 1915 after having his death sentence commuted, an event which deeply impacted the jewish community in atlanta and across the country. on may 21, 1917, the great atlanta fire destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the old fourth ward, resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.
on december 15, 1939, atlanta hosted the premiere of "gone with the wind", the epic film based on the best-selling novel by atlanta's margaret mitchell. the gala event at loew's grand theatre was attended by the film's legendary producer, david o. selznick, and the film's stars clark gable, vivien leigh, and olivia de havilland, but oscar winner hattie mcdaniel, an african american actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws and policies.
atlanta played a vital role in the allied effort during world war ii due to the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases, leading to rapid population and economic growth. in the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system allowed middle class atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. as a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.
during the 1960s, atlanta was a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with dr. martin luther king, jr., ralph david abernathy, and students from atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. while minimal compared to other cities, atlanta was not free of racial strife. in 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in cascade heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster atlanta as the "city too busy to hate". desegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with public transportation desegregated by 1959, the restaurant at rich's department store by 1961, movie theaters by 1963, and public schools by 1973. in the private sphere, the westminster schools desegregated in 1967.
in 1960, whites comprised 61.7% of the city's population. during the 1950s–70s, white flight from urban areas led to a significant demographic shift. by 1970, african americans were a majority of the city's population and exercised new-found political influence by electing atlanta's first black mayor, maynard jackson, in 1973. under mayor jackson's tenure, atlanta's airport was modernized, solidifying the city's role as a transportation center. the opening of the georgia world congress center in 1976 heralded atlanta's rise as a convention city. construction of the city's subway system began in 1975, with rail service commencing in 1979. despite these improvements, atlanta lost over 100,000 residents between 1970 and 1990, over 20% of its population.
atlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 summer olympic games. following the announcement, the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure. while the games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies as well as the centennial olympic park bombing, the spectacle was a watershed event in atlanta's history that initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade.
during the 2000s, atlanta underwent a profound physical, cultural, and demographic transformation. suburbanization, a booming economy, and new migrants decreased the city's black percentage from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010. from 2000 to 2010, atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 asian residents, and 3,095 hispanic residents, while the city's black population decreased by 31,678. much of the city's demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding downtown atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%. between the mid-1990s and 2010, stimulated by funding from the hope vi program, atlanta demolished nearly all of its public housing, a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units in the city.
in 2005, the $2.8 billion beltline project was adopted, with the stated goals of converting a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and increasing the city's park space by 40%. atlanta's cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the high museum of art doubled in size; the alliance theatre won a tony award; and art galleries were established on the once-industrial westside. the city of atlanta was the subject of a massive cyberattack which began in march 2018.
atlanta encompasses , of which is land and is water. the city is situated among the foothills of the appalachian mountains. at above mean sea level, atlanta has one of the highest elevations among major cities east of the mississippi river. atlanta straddles the eastern continental divide, such that rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the atlantic ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the gulf of mexico. atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the chattahoochee river, which is part of the acf river basin. located at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is preserved, in part by the chattahoochee river national recreation area.
most of atlanta was burned during the civil war, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally "southern" because atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a patrician southern seaport like savannah or charleston. many of the city's landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the northeast or midwest.
during the cold war era, atlanta embraced global modernist trends, especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture. examples of modernist architecture include the westin peachtree plaza (1976), georgia-pacific tower (1982), the state of georgia building (1966), and the atlanta marriott marquis (1985). in the latter half of the 1980s, atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape. many of atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as the one atlantic center (1987), 191 peachtree tower (1991), and the four seasons hotel atlanta (1992). also completed during the era is atlanta's tallest skyscraper, the bank of america plaza (1992), which, at , is the 61st-tallest building in the world and the 14th-tallest building in the united states. the bank of america plaza is the tallest building outside of new york city, chicago, philadelphia, los angeles, and san francisco, and was the last building built in the united states to be in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until one world trade center was completed externally in may 2013. the city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, including the equitable building (1892–1971), terminal station (1905–1972), and the carnegie library (1902–1977). the fox theatre (1929)—atlanta's cultural icon—would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid-1970s.
atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods. the city contains three major high-rise districts, which form a north-south axis along peachtree: downtown, midtown, and buckhead. surrounding these high-density districts are leafy, low-density neighborhoods, most of which are dominated by single-family homes.
downtown atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area, much of it occupied by government entities. downtown is home to the city's sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions. midtown atlanta is the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of many of the region's law firms. midtown is known for its art institutions, cultural attractions, institutions of higher education, and dense form. buckhead, the city's uptown district, is north of downtown and the city's third-largest business district. the district is marked by an urbanized core along peachtree road, surrounded by suburban single-family neighborhoods situated among dense forests and rolling hills.
surrounding atlanta's three high-rise districts are the city's low- and medium-density neighborhoods, where the craftsman bungalow single-family home is dominant. the eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the 1890s-1930s as havens for the upper middle class. these neighborhoods, many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded, architecturally-distinct residential streets, include the victorian inman park, bohemian east atlanta, and eclectic old fourth ward. on the westside and along the beltline on the eastside, former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing, retail space, and art galleries, transforming the once-industrial areas such as west midtown into model neighborhoods for smart growth, historic rehabilitation, and infill construction. in southwest atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs, including the historic west end, while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout, including collier heights and cascade heights, home to much of the city's affluent african american population. northwest atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of marietta boulevard and to the north of martin luther king, jr. drive, including those neighborhoods remote to downtown, such as riverside, bolton and whittier mill, which is one of atlanta's designated landmark historical neighborhoods. vine city, though technically northwest, adjoins the city's downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives.
gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary atlanta. the gentrification of atlanta has its origins in the 1970s, after many of atlanta's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major american cities in the mid-20th century. when neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through the city's east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for atlanta's gentrification. after atlanta was awarded the olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. gentrification post-2000 has been aided by the atlanta housing authority's eradication of the city's public housing and, more recently, the construction of the beltline.
atlanta has a humid subtropical climate ("cfa") according to the köppen classification, with the seasons more or less defined, although the winter has a shorter duration, with hot and humid summers and mild winters (in some cases the outbreaks are cold), but susceptible to snowstorms even if in small quantities on several occasions unlike the rest of the southeastern united states. winters are mild but variable, with an average of 48 freezing days per year, though temperatures very rarely drop even close to . warm air from the gulf of mexico can bring spring-like highs while strong arctic air masses can push lows into the teens °f (−7 to -12 °c).
july averages , with high temperatures reaching on an average 44 days per year, though readings are not seen most years. january averages , with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler due largely to the urban heat island effect. lows at or below freezing can be expected 40 nights annually, but extended stretches with daily high temperatures below are very rare, with a recent exception in january 2014. extremes range from on february 13, 1899 to on june 30, 2012. average dewpoints in the summer range from in june to in july. according to the usda, atlanta is situated in hardiness zone 8a, with northern and western suburbs transitioning to 7b.
typical of the southeastern u.s., atlanta receives abundant rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year, though spring and early fall are markedly drier. the average annual rainfall is , while snowfall is typically light at around 2.9 to 5 inches per year. the heaviest single snowfall occurred on january 23, 1940, with around of snow. however, ice storms usually cause more problems than snowfall does, the most severe occurring on january 7, 1973. tornadoes are rare in the city itself, but the march 14, 2008 ef2 tornado damaged prominent structures in downtown atlanta.
the 2010 united states census reported that atlanta had a population of 420,003. the population density was 3,154 per square mile (1232/km). the racial makeup and population of atlanta was 54.0% black or african american, 38.4% white, 3.1% asian and 0.2% native american. those from some other race made up 2.2% of the city's population, while those from two or more races made up 2.0%. hispanics of any race made up 5.2% of the city's population. the median income for a household in the city was $45,171. the per capita income for the city was $35,453. 22.6% percent of the population was living below the poverty line. atlanta has one of the highest lgbt populations per capita according to a survey by the williams institute, ranking third among major american cities, behind san francisco and slightly behind seattle, with 12.8% of the city's total population identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 7.3% of atlantans were born abroad (86th in the us).
in the 2010 census, atlanta was recorded as the nation's fourth-largest majority-black city. it has long been known as a center of african-american political power, education, economic prosperity, and culture, often called a black mecca. some african-american residents of atlanta have followed an influx of whites to newer housing in the suburbs in the early 21st century. from 2000 to 2010, the city's black population decreased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010.
at the same time, the white population of atlanta has increased. between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of whites in the city's population grew faster than any other u.s. city. in that decade, atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000.
out of the total population five years and older, 83.3% spoke only english at home, while 8.8% spoke spanish, 3.9% another indo-european language, and 2.8% an asian language. atlanta's dialect has traditionally been a variation of southern american english. the chattahoochee river long formed a border between the coastal southern and southern appalachian dialects. because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region, attracting migrants from other areas of the country, by 2003, "atlanta" magazine concluded atlanta had become significantly "de-southernized." a southern accent was considered a handicap in some circumstances. in general, southern accents are less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among younger people; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older people. at the same time, some residents of the city express southern variations of african-american english.
religion in atlanta, while historically centered on protestant christianity, now involves many faiths as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. protestant christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city (63%), but in recent decades the catholic church has increased in numbers and influence because of new migrants in the region. metro atlanta also has numerous ethnic or national christian congregations, including korean and indian churches. the larger non-christian faiths are judaism, islam and hinduism. overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within atlanta.
with a gdp of $385 billion, the atlanta metropolitan area's economy is the tenth-largest in the country and among the top 20-largest in the world. corporate operations play a major role in atlanta's economy, as the city claims the nation's third-largest concentration of fortune 500 companies. it also hosts the global headquarters of corporations like the coca-cola company, the home depot, delta air lines, at&t mobility, chick-fil-a, and ups. over 75% of fortune 1000 companies conduct business operations in the city's metro area, and the region hosts offices of over 1,250 multinational corporations. many corporations are drawn to the city by its educated workforce; , 45% of adults aged 25 or older residing in the city have at least 4-year college degrees, compared to the national average of 28%.
atlanta started as a railroad town, and logistics has been a major component of the city's economy to this day. atlanta serves as an important rail junction and contains major classification yards for norfolk southern and csx. since its construction in the 1950s, hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport has served as a key engine of the city's economic growth. delta air lines, the city's largest employer and the metro area's third-largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at hartsfield-jackson, and it has helped make it the world's busiest airport, in terms of both passenger traffic and aircraft operations. partly due to the airport, atlanta has been also a hub for diplomatic missions; , the city contains 26 consulates general, the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the us.
media is also an important aspect of atlanta's economy. in fact, the city is even a major cable television programming center. ted turner established the headquarters of both the cable news network (cnn) and the turner broadcasting system (tbs) in the city. cox enterprises, the nation's third-largest cable television service and the publisher of over a dozen american newspapers, is headquartered in the city. the weather channel is headquartered just outside of atlanta in suburban cobb county.
information technology—a business sector that includes publishing, software development, entertainment and data processing—has garnered a larger percentage of atlanta's economic output. atlanta has, indeed, been nicknamed the "silicon peach" thanks to its burgeoning technology sector. , atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of information technology jobs in the us, numbering 85,000+. the city also is ranked as the sixth fastest-growing community for information technology jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs. information technology companies are drawn to atlanta's lower costs and educated workforce.
recently, atlanta has been a center for film and television production, largely because of the georgia entertainment industry investment act, which awards qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more. film and television production facilities based in atlanta include turner studios, pinewood studios (pinewood atlanta), tyler perry studios, williams street productions, and the eue/screen gems soundstages. film and television production injected $9.5 billion into georgia's economy in 2017, with atlanta garnering most of the projects. as a result, by the following year, atlanta emerged as one of the all-time most popular destinations for film production globally.
compared to other american cities, atlanta's economy in the past had been disproportionately affected by the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession, with the city's economy earning a ranking of 68 among 100 american cities in a september 2014 report due to an elevated unemployment rate, declining real income levels, and a depressed housing market. from 2010 to 2011, atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and plateauing income growth at 0.4%. although unemployment had decreased to 7% by late 2014, this was still higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.8% atlanta's housing market has also struggled, with home prices dropping by 2.1% in january 2012, reaching levels not seen since 1996. compared with a year earlier, the average home price in atlanta plummeted to 17.3% in february 2012, thus becoming the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any american or global city. the decline in home prices prompted some economists to deem atlanta the worst housing market in the nation at the height of the depression. nevertheless, the city's real estate market has resurged since 2012, so much median home value and rent growth significantly outpaced the national average by 2018, thanks to a rapidly-growing regional economy.
atlanta has a dynamic, distinctly southern, culture. this is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the u.s., in addition to many recent immigrants to the u.s. who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly multi-cultural metropolitan area. thus, although traditional southern culture is part of atlanta's cultural fabric, it is mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's most cosmopolitan cities. this unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of midtown, the quirky neighborhoods on the city's eastside, and the multi-ethnic enclaves found along buford highway.
atlanta is one of few united states cities with permanent, professional, and resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera (atlanta opera), ballet (atlanta ballet), orchestral music (atlanta symphony orchestra), and theater (the alliance theatre). atlanta attracts many touring broadway acts, concerts, shows, and exhibitions catering to a variety of interests. atlanta's performing arts district is concentrated in midtown atlanta at the woodruff arts center, which is home to the atlanta symphony orchestra and the alliance theatre. the city frequently hosts touring broadway acts, especially at the fox theatre, a historic landmark among the highest-grossing theatres of its size.
as a national center for the arts, atlanta is home to significant art museums and institutions. the renowned high museum of art is arguably the south's leading art museum and among the most-visited art museums in the world. the museum of design atlanta (moda) and the scad fash museum of fashion + film are the only such museums in the southeast. contemporary art museums include the atlanta contemporary art center and the museum of contemporary art of georgia. institutions of higher education contribute to atlanta's art scene, with the savannah college of art and design's atlanta campus providing the city's arts community with a steady stream of curators, and emory university's michael c. carlos museum containing the largest collection of ancient art in the southeast.
atlanta has become one of the usa's best cities for street art in recent years. it is home to living walls, an annual street art conference and the outerspace project, an annual event series that merges public art, live music, design, action sports, and culture. examples of street art in atlanta can be found on the atlanta street art map.
atlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of american music at different points in the city's history. beginning as early as the 1920s, atlanta emerged as a center for country music, which was brought to the city by migrants from appalachia. during the countercultural 1960s, atlanta hosted the atlanta international pop festival, with the 1969 festival taking place more than a month before woodstock and featuring many of the same bands. the city was also a center for southern rock during its 1970s heyday: the allman brothers band's hit instrumental "hot 'lanta" is an ode to the city, while lynyrd skynyrd's famous live rendition of "free bird" was recorded at the fox theatre in 1976, with lead singer ronnie van zant directing the band to "play it pretty for atlanta". during the 1980s, atlanta had an active punk rock scene centered on two of the city's music venues, 688 club and the metroplex, and atlanta famously played host to the sex pistols first u.s. show, which was performed at the great southeastern music hall. the 1990s saw the city produce major mainstream acts across many different musical genres. country music artist travis tritt, and r&b sensations tlc, usher and toni braxton, were just some of the musicians proud to call atlanta home. the city also gave birth to atlanta hip hop, a subgenre that gained relevance and success with the introduction of the home-grown atliens known as outkast, along with other dungeon family artists such as organized noize and goodie mob; however, it was not until the 2000s that atlanta moved "from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity with another sub-genre called crunk, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the south and east". also in the 2000s, atlanta was recognized by the brooklyn-based "vice" magazine for its indie rock scene, which revolves around the various live music venues found on the city's alternative eastside. to facilitate further local development, the state government provides qualified businesses and productions a 15% transferable income tax credit for in-state costs of music investments.
as a national center for cinema and television production, atlanta plays a significant role in the entertainment industry. it doubles for other parts of the world and fictional settlements in blockbuster productions, among them the newer titles from "the fast and the furious" franchise and marvel features such as "ant-man" (2015), "" (2016), "black panther" and "" (both 2018). on the other hand, "gone with the wind" (1939), "smokey and the bandit" (1977), "sharkey's machine" (1981), "the slugger's wife" (1985), "driving miss daisy" (1989), "atl" (2006), and "baby driver" (2017) are among several notable examples of films actually set in atlanta. the city also provides the backdrop for shows such as "the walking dead", "stranger things", and "atlanta", in addition to a myriad of animated and reality television programming.

the city has also become known for its prevalence of electric scooters.
atlanta has a network of freeways that radiate out from the city, and automobiles are the dominant means of transportation in the region. three major interstate highways converge in atlanta: i-20 (east-west), i-75 (northwest-southeast), and i-85 (northeast-southwest). the latter two combine in the middle of the city to form the downtown connector (i-75/85), which carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day and is one of the most congested segments of interstate highway in the united states. atlanta is mostly encircled by interstate 285, a beltway locally known as "the perimeter" that has come to mark the boundary between "inside the perimeter" (itp), the city and close-in suburbs, and "outside the perimeter" (otp), the outer suburbs and exurbs. the heavy reliance on automobiles for transportation in atlanta has resulted in traffic, commute, and air pollution rates that rank among the worst in the country. the city of atlanta has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. in 2015, 15.2 percent of atlanta households lacked a car, and increased slightly to 16.4 percent in 2016. the national average is 8.7 percent in 2016. atlanta averaged 1.31 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.
the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) provides public transportation in the form of buses, heavy rail, and a downtown light rail loop. notwithstanding heavy automotive usage in atlanta, the city's subway system is the eighth busiest in the country. marta rail lines connect key destinations, such as the airport, downtown, midtown, buckhead, and perimeter center. however, significant destinations, such as emory university and cumberland, remain unserved. as a result, a 2011 brookings institution study placed atlanta 91st of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility. emory university operates its cliff shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month, while private minibuses supply buford highway. amtrak, the national rail passenger system, provides service to atlanta via the "crescent train" (new york–new orleans), which stops at peachtree station. in 2014, the atlanta streetcar opened to the public. the streetcar's line, which is also known as the downtown loop, runs around the downtown tourist areas of peachtree center, centennial olympic park, the martin luther king, jr. national historic site, and sweet auburn. the atlanta streetcar line is also being expanded on in the coming years to include a wider range of atlanta's neighborhoods and important places of interest, with a total of over of track in the plan.
hartsfield–jackson atlanta international airport is the world's busiest airport as measured by passenger traffic and aircraft traffic. the facility offers air service to over 150 u.s. destinations and more than 75 international destinations in 50 countries, with over 2,500 arrivals and departures daily. delta air lines maintains its largest hub at the airport. situated () south of downtown, the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by interstate 75, interstate 85, and interstate 285.
cycling is a growing mode of transportation in atlanta, more than doubling since 2009, when it comprised 1.1% of all commutes (up from 0.3% in 2000). although atlanta's lack of bike lanes and hilly topography may deter many residents from cycling, the city's transportation plan calls for the construction of of bike lanes by 2020, with the beltline helping to achieve this goal. in 2012, atlanta's first "bike track" was constructed on 10th street in midtown. the two lane bike track runs from monroe drive west to charles allen drive, with connections to the beltline and piedmont park. starting in june 2016, atlanta received a bike sharing program, known as relay bike share, with 100 bikes in downtown and midtown, which expanded to 500 bikes at 65 stations as of april 2017.
according to the 2016 american community survey (five-year average), 68.6% of working city of atlanta residents commuted by driving alone, 7% carpooled, 10% used public transportation, and 4.6% walked. about 2.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. about 7.6% worked at home.
atlanta has a reputation as a "city in a forest" due to an abundance of trees that is rare among major cities. the city's main street is named after a tree, and beyond the downtown, midtown, and buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. the city is home to the atlanta dogwood festival, an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early april, when the native dogwoods are in bloom. the nickname is factually accurate, as vegetation covers 47.9% of the city as of 2017, the highest among all major american cities, and well above the national average of 27%. atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by "national geographic" in naming atlanta a "place of a lifetime".
the city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. a 2001 study found atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996. community organizations and the city government are addressing the problem. trees atlanta, a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 113,000 shade trees in the city, and atlanta's government has awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees. fees are additionally imposed on developers that remove trees on their property per a citywide ordinance, active since 1993.
atlanta has 17 sister cities, as designated by sister cities international, inc. (sci):

axiology (from greek , "axia", "value, worth"; and , "-logia") is the philosophical study of value. it is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics. the term was first used by paul lapie, in 1902, and eduard von hartmann, in 1908.
axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: ethics and aesthetics. ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." formal axiology, the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with mathematical rigor, is exemplified by robert s. hartman's science of value.
between the 5th and 6th centuries bc, it was important in greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. socrates believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. socrates' student, plato furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. with the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped christianity. during the medieval period, thomas aquinas made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. this concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.

a doll's house (; also translated as "a doll house") is a three-act play written by norway's henrik ibsen. it premiered at the royal theatre in copenhagen, denmark, on 21 december 1879, having been published earlier that month. the play is set in a norwegian town circa 1879.
the play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. it aroused a great sensation at the time, and caused a "storm of outraged controversy" that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society.
in 2006, the centennial of ibsen's death, "a doll's house" held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year. unesco has inscribed ibsen's autographed manuscripts of "a doll's house" on the memory of the world register in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.
the title of the play is most commonly translated as "a doll's house", though some scholars use "a doll house". john simon says that "a doll’s house" is "the british term for what [americans] call a 'dollhouse'". egil törnqvist says of the alternative title: "rather than being superior to the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to americans."
the play opens at christmas time as nora helmer enters her home carrying many packages. nora's husband torvald is working in his study when she arrives. he playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on christmas gifts, calling her his "little squirrel." he teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. this year torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. the maid announces two visitors: mrs. kristine linde, an old friend of nora's, who has come seeking employment; and dr. rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. nora says that things have not been easy for them either: torvald became sick, and they had to travel to italy so he could recover. kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is "unspeakably empty." nora promises to talk to torvald about finding her a job. kristine gently tells nora that she is like a child. nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got money from "some admirer," so they could travel to italy to improve torvald's health. she told torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband. over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.
krogstad, a lower-level employee at torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. dr. rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. in contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, krogstad, is "morally diseased."
after the meeting with krogstad, torvald comes out of the study. nora asks him if he can give kristine a position at the bank and torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. torvald, kristine, and dr. rank leave the house, leaving nora alone. the nanny returns with the children and nora plays with them for a while until krogstad creeps through the ajar door, into the living room, and surprises her. krogstad tells nora that torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with torvald to allow him to keep his job. she refuses, and krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature after his death. krogstad leaves and when torvald returns, nora tries to convince him not to fire krogstad. torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man "poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation."
kristine arrives to help nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and torvald plan to attend the next day. torvald returns from the bank, and nora pleads with him to reinstate krogstad, claiming she is worried krogstad will publish libelous articles about torvald and ruin his career. torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is too familial around torvald in front of other bank personnel. torvald then retires to his study to work.
dr. rank, the family friend, arrives. nora asks him for a favor, but rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of tuberculosis of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. she then clumsily attempts to tell him that she is not in love with him, but that she loves him dearly as a friend.
desperate after being fired by torvald, krogstad arrives at the house. nora convinces dr. rank to go into torvald's study so he will not see krogstad. when krogstad confronts nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated bond to blackmail torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. krogstad informs nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of surety on the bond) and put it in torvald's mailbox, which is locked.
nora tells kristine of her difficult situation. she gives her krogstad's card with his address, and asks her to try to convince him to relent.
torvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. she dances so badly and acts so childishly that torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. when the others go to dinner, nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to preempt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.
kristine tells krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. she believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter from torvald. however, kristine decides that torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and nora's marriage.
after literally dragging nora home from the party, torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by dr. rank, who has followed them. dr. rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. dr. rank leaves, and torvald retrieves his letters. as he reads them, nora steels herself to take her life. torvald confronts her with krogstad's letter. enraged, he declares that he is now completely in krogstad's power; he must yield to krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. he berates nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. he says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.
a maid enters, delivering a letter to nora. the letter is from krogstad, yet torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from nora. torvald exults that he is saved, as krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which torvald immediately burns along with krogstad's letters. he takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does nora.
torvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. he dismisses the fact that nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. he preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.
nora tells torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment. she says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. she feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. she has lost her religion. she says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. concerned for the family reputation, torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. she reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. she now realizes that torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.
torvald is unable to comprehend nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, nora then leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.
ibsen's german agent felt that the original ending would not play well in german theatres. in addition, copyright laws of the time would not preserve ibsen's original work. therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, and prevent the translator from altering his work, ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the german premiere. in this ending, nora is led to her children after having argued with torvald. seeing them, she collapses, and as the curtain is brought down, it is implied that she stays. ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a "barbaric outrage". virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.
"a doll's house" was based on the life of laura kieler (maiden name laura smith petersen), a good friend of ibsen. much that happened between nora and torvald happened to laura and her husband, victor. similar to the events in the play, laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. she wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis. she wrote to ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. at his refusal, she forged a check for the money. at this point she was found out. in real life, when victor discovered about laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known danish author, living to the age of 83.
ibsen wrote "a doll's house" at the point when laura kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. in the play, nora leaves torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.
kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as "ibsen's nora" years afterwards.
ibsen started thinking about the play around may 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its protagonist, nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing "a blue woollen dress"). he outlined his conception of the play as a "modern tragedy" in a note written in rome on 19 october 1878. "a woman cannot be herself in modern society," he argues, since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint."
ibsen sent a fair copy of the completed play to his publisher on 15 september 1879. it was first published in copenhagen on 4 december 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 january 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 march.
"a doll's house" received its world premiere on 21 december 1879 at the royal theatre in copenhagen, with betty hennings as nora, emil poulsen as torvald, and peter jerndorff as dr. rank. writing for the norwegian newspaper "folkets avis", the critic erik bøgh admired ibsen's originality and technical mastery: "not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear." every performance of its run was sold out. another production opened at the royal theatre in stockholm, on 8 january 1880, while productions in christiania (with johanne juell as nora and arnoldus reimers as torvald) and bergen followed shortly after.
in germany, the actress hedwig niemann-raabe refused to perform the play as written, declaring, ""i" would never leave "my" children!" since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a "barbaric outrage" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which nora did not leave. a production of this version opened in flensburg in february 1880. this version was also played in hamburg, dresden, hanover, and berlin, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, niemann-raabe eventually restored the original ending. another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which ibsen attended, opened on 3 march 1880 at the residenz theatre in munich.
in great britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in london was in an adaptation by henry arthur jones and henry herman called "breaking a butterfly". this adaptation was produced at the princess theatre, 3 march 1884. writing in 1896 in his book "the foundations of a national drama", jones says: "a rough translation from the german version of a doll's house was put into my hands, and i was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the london boards. i knew nothing of ibsen, but i knew a great deal of robertson and h. j. byron. from these circumstances came the adaptation called "breaking a butterfly"." h. l. mencken writes that it was "a doll’s house" "denaturized and dephlogisticated. … toward the middle of the action ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from krogstad’s desk. … the curtain fell upon a happy home."
before 1899 there were two private productions of the play in london (in its original form as ibsen wrote it) — one featured george bernard shaw in the role of krogstad. the first public british production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 june 1889 at the novelty theatre, starring janet achurch as nora and charles charrington as torvald. achurch played nora again for a 7-day run in 1897. soon after its london premiere, achurch brought the play to australia in 1889.
the play was first seen in america in 1883 in louisville, kentucky; helena modjeska acted nora. the play made its broadway premiere at the palmer's theatre on 21 december 1889, starring beatrice cameron as nora helmer. it was first performed in france in 1894.
other productions in the united states include one in 1902 starring minnie maddern fiske, a 1937 adaptation with acting script by thornton wilder and starring ruth gordon, and a 1971 production starring claire bloom.
a new translation by zinnie harris at the donmar warehouse, starring gillian anderson, toby stephens, anton lesser, tara fitzgerald and christopher eccleston opened in may 2009.
the play was performed by in march 2011, one of their early performances following their december 2010 lower manhattan launch.
in august 2013, young vic, london, great britain, produced a new adaptation of "a doll's house" directed by carrie cracknell based on the english language version by simon stephens.
in september 2014, in partnership with brisbane festival, la boite located in brisbane, australia, hosted an adaptation of "a doll's house" written by lally katz and directed by stephen mitchell wright.
in june 2015, space arts centre in london staged an adaptation of "a doll's house" featuring the discarded alternate ending.
'manaveli' toronto staged a tamil version of "a doll's house"(ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு)on 30 june 2018,translated and directed by mr p wikneswaran. the drama was very well received by the tamil community in toronto and was staged again in few months later. the same stage play was filmed at the beginning of 2019 and screened in toronto on 4 may 2019. the film was received with very good reviews and the artists were hailed for their performance. now, arrangements are being made to screen the film,ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு, in london, at safari cinema harrow, on 7 july 2019;
"a doll's house" questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage. to many 19th-century europeans, this was scandalous. the covenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as ibsen did was controversial. however, the irish playwright george bernard shaw found ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.
the swedish playwright august strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories "getting married" (1884). strindberg questioned nora's walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. strindberg also considers that nora's involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved nora forging a signature, all done behind her husband's back, and then nora's lying to her husband regarding krogstad's blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when nora is moralistically judging her husband. and strindberg points out that nora's complaint that she and torvald "have never exchanged one serious word about serious things," is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.
the reasons nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play. in the last scene, she tells her husband she has been "greatly wronged" by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his "doll wife" — and the children in turn have become her "dolls," leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. she is troubled by her husband's behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money. she does not love her husband, she feels they are strangers, she feels completely confused, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. george bernard shaw suggests that she left to begin "a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life," and that her revolt is "the end of a chapter of human history."
ibsen was inspired by the belief that "a woman cannot be herself in modern society," since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint." its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: michael meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights, but rather "the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person." in a speech given to the norwegian association for women's rights in 1898, ibsen insisted that he "must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement," since he wrote "without any conscious thought of making propaganda," his task having been "the "description of humanity"."
because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself. in "iconoclasts" (1905), james huneker noted "that slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world."
"a doll's house" has been adapted for the cinema on many occasions, including:

the aim-7 sparrow is an american, medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile operated by the united states air force, united states navy, and united states marine corps, as well as other various air forces and navies. sparrow and its derivatives were the west's principal beyond visual range (bvr) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. it remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced aim-120 amraam.
the early sparrow was intended primarily for use against larger targets and especially bombers, and had numerous operational limitations in other uses. against smaller targets, the need to receive a strong reflected radar signal made achieving lock-on at the missile's effective range difficult. as the launching aircraft's own radar needed to be pointed at the target throughout the engagement, this meant that in fighter-vs-fighter combat the enemy fighter would often approach within the range of shorter-range infrared homing missiles while the launching aircraft had to continue flying towards its target. additionally, early models were only effective against targets at roughly the same or higher altitudes, below which reflections from the ground became a problem.
a number of upgraded sparrow designs were developed to address these issues. in the early 1970s, the raf developed a version with an inverse monopulse seeker and improved motor known as skyflash, while the italian air force introduced the similar aspide. both had the ability to be fired at targets below the launching fighter ("look-down, shoot down"), were more resistant to countermeasures, and much more accurate in the terminal phases. this basic concept was then made part of the us sparrows in the m model (for monopulse) and some of these were later updated as the p model, the last to be produced in the us. aspides sold to china resulted in the locally produced pl10. the japan self-defense forces also employ the sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the mitsubishi aam-4.
the sparrow was also used as the basis for a surface-to-air missile, the rim-7 sea sparrow, which is used by a number of navies for air defense of their ships. fired at low altitude and flying directly at its target through the lower atmosphere, the range of the missile in this role is greatly reduced. with the retirement of the sparrow in the air-to-air role, a new version of the sea sparrow was produced to address this concern, producing the much larger and more capable rim-162 essm.
nato pilots use the brevity code "fox one" in radio communication to signal launch of a semi-active radar homing missile such as the sparrow.
from a late-1940s united states navy program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. in 1947 the navy contracted sperry to build a beam riding version of a standard hvar, the standard unguided aerial rocket, under project hotshot. the weapon was initially dubbed kas-1, then aam-2, and, from 1948 on, aam-n-2. the airframe was developed by douglas aircraft company. the diameter of the hvar proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading douglas to expand the missile's airframe to diameter. the prototype weapon began unpowered flight-tests in 1947, and made its first aerial interception in 1952.
after a protracted development cycle the initial aam-n-2 "sparrow" entered limited operational service in 1954 with specially modified skyknights all weather carrier night fighters. in 1956, they were joined by the f3h-2m demon and f7u cutlass fighter aircraft. compared to the modern versions, the sparrow i was more streamlined and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.
sparrow i was a limited and rather primitive weapon. the limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight on single seater fighters and a radar with night fighters) restricted the missile to attacks against targets flying a straight course and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.
as early as 1950 douglas examined equipping the sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as xaam-n-2a "sparrow ii, the original retroactively becoming sparrow i". in 1952 it was given the new code aam-n-3. the active radar made the sparrow ii a "fire and forget" weapon, allowing several to be fired at separate targets at the same time.
by 1955 douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the f5d skylancer interceptor. it was later selected, with some controversy, to be the primary weapon for the canadian avro arrow supersonic interceptor, along with the new astra fire-control system. for canadian use and as a second source for us missiles, canadair was selected to build the missiles in quebec.
the small size of the missile forebody and the k-band an/apq-64-radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing. after considerable development and test firings in the u.s. and canada, douglas abandoned development in 1956. canadair continued development until the arrow was cancelled in 1959.
a subvariant of the sparrow i armed with the same nuclear warhead as the mb-1 genie was proposed in 1958, but was cancelled shortly thereafter.
concurrently with the development of the sparrow i, in 1951, raytheon began work on the semi-active radar homing version of sparrow family of missiles, the aam-n-6 "sparrow iii". the first of these weapons entered united states navy service in 1958.
the aam-n-6a was similar to the -6, but used a new thiokol liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. it also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. the -6a was also selected to arm the air force's "f-110a spectre" (f-4 phantom) fighters in 1962, known to them as the aim-101. it entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built.
another upgrade reverted to a rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the aam-n-6b, which started production in 1963. the new motor significantly increased maximum range to for head-on attacks.
during this year the air force and navy agreed on standardized naming conventions for their missiles. the sparrows became the aim-7 series. the original sparrow i and aborted sparrow ii became the aim-7a and aim-7b, despite both being out of service. the -6, -6a, and -6b became the aim-7c, aim-7d, and aim-7e respectively.
25,000 aim-7es were produced, and saw extensive use during the vietnam war, where its performance was generally considered disappointing. the mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited bvr (beyond visual range) engagements. the p (kill probability) of the aim-7e was less than 10%; us fighter pilots shot down 59 aircraft out of the 612 sparrows fired. of the 612 aim-7d/e/e-2 missiles fired, 97 (or 15.8%) hit their targets, resulting in 56 (or 9.2%) kills. two kills were obtained beyond visual range.
in 1969 an improved version, the e-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fuzing. considered a "dogfight sparrow", the aim-7e-2 was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, and in the head-on aspect, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. even so, its kill rate was only 13% in combat, leading to a practice of ripple-firing all four at once in hopes of increasing kill probability. its worst tendency was that of detonating prematurely, approximately a thousand feet in front of the launching aircraft, but it also had many motor failures, erratic flights, and fuzing problems. an e-3 version included additional changes to the fuzing, and an e-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the f-14 tomcat.
improved versions of the aim-7 were developed in the 1970s in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. the aim-7f, which entered service in 1976, had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, solid-state electronics for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. even this version had room for improvement, leading british aerospace and the italian firm alenia to develop advanced versions of sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the bae skyflash and alenia aspide, respectively.
the most common version of the sparrow today, the aim-7m, entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of skyflash), active radar proximity fuse, digital controls, improved ecm resistance, and better low-altitude performance. it was used to good advantage in the 1991 gulf war, where it scored many usaf air-to-air kills. of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.
the aim-7p is similar in most ways to the m versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing m-series missiles. the main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. a follow-on block ii upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. plans initially called for all m versions to be upgraded, but currently p's are being issued as required to replace m's lost or removed from the inventory.
the final version of the missile was to have been the aim-7r, which added an infrared homing seeker to an otherwise unchanged aim-7p block ii. a general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997.
sparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar aim-120 amraam, but is likely to remain in service for several years.
as part of the avro canada cf-105 arrow program, canadair (now bombardier) partnered with douglas aircraft company in the development of the sparrow ii (aam-n-3/aim-7b). after douglas dropped out of this program, canadair continued on with it until the termination of the arrow project.
the aam-n-3 sparrow ii was unique in that it had a fully active radar guidance system. this combined both a radar transmitter and receiver in the missile, making it unnecessary for the pilot to keep the aircraft aimed at the target after firing the missile, unlike semi-active radar homing (sarh) missiles which require continuous radar-assisted guidance throughout flight. this allowed the aircraft that fired the aam-n-3 to turn away, prosecute other targets, and/or escape from potential retaliatory missiles fired by the enemy aircraft during the time it takes for the sparrow to reach its target. despite the significant advantages of this design over sarh guidance, all subsequent models of the sparrow use semi-active radar homing.
to accommodate the active radar guidance system, the aam-n-3 sparrow ii had a much greater volume than its predecessor. its size would subsequently set the precedent for all future sparrow variants.
in 1959, canadair had completed five missiles based on airframes from douglas, and built two models from scratch, when the program was cancelled with the cancellation of the arrow.
skyguard i is an anti-aircraft system, utilizing ground-based aim-7 sparrow launchers.
the italian company finmeccanica (now leonardo s.p.a.), alenia difesa licensed the aim-7e sparrow technology from the us, and produced its own improved version called aspide.
the ly-60/fd-60/pl-10 is a family of prc missiles developed by the shanghai academy of science and technology, largely based on the italian aspide missile - a version of the sparrow. there are four versions of the basic design, three of which are surface-to-air and one air-to-air.
the soviet union acquired an aim-7 in 1968 and a vympel team started copying it as the k-25. the missile did not enter production as the r-23 was thought to have better versatility, range, signal processing logic, and immunity from interference. k-25 work ended in 1971, but analysis of the sparrow was later used to inform the design of the vympel r-27, particularly the servomechanisms and movable wings.
british aerospace (bae) licensed the aim-7e2 technology in the 1970s, producing the skyflash missile. skyflash used a marconi xj521 monopulse semi-active seeker together with improvements to the electronics. it was powered by the aerojet mk52 mod 2 rocket engine (later by the rocketdyne mk38 mod 4). skyflash entered service with the royal air force (raf) on their phantom fg.1/fgr.2 in 1978, and later on the tornado f3. skyflash was also exported to sweden for use on their viggen fighters.
an upgraded version with active radar seeker, called active sky flash was proposed by bae and thomson-csf, but did not receive funding because the raf opted for other missiles.
the sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, warhead, control, and rocket motor (currently the hercules mk-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). it has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. although the external dimensions of the sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. the warhead is of the continuous-rod type.
as with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. the receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.
the launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. in radars of the 1950s these were single target tracking devices using a nutating horn as part of the antenna. this caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. the missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. the missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing waveguides. the comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting chaff.

the aim-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, or amraam (pronounced ), is an american beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (bvraam) capable of all-weather day-and-night operations. designed with a 7-inch (180mm) diameter form-and-fit factor, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it has the advantage of being a fire-and-forget weapon when compared to the previous generation sparrow missiles. when an amraam missile is launched, nato pilots use the brevity code fox three.
the amraam is the world's most popular beyond-visual-range missile, and more than 14,000 have been produced for the united states air force, the united states navy, and 33 international customers. the amraam has been used in several engagements and is credited with ten air-to-air kills.
the aim-7 sparrow medium range missile (mrm) was purchased by the us navy from original developer hughes aircraft in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with "beyond visual range" (bvr) capability. with an effective range of about , it was introduced as a radar beam-riding missile and then it was improved to a semi-active radar guided missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. it was effective at visual to beyond visual range. the early beam riding versions of the sparrow missiles were integrated onto the f3h demon and f7u cutlass, but the definitive aim-7 sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather f-4 phantom ii fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its u.s. navy, u.s. marine corps, and early u.s. air force versions. the f-4 carried up to four aim-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.
although designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over north vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. together with the short-range, infrared-guided aim-9 sidewinder, they replaced the aim-4 falcon ir and radar guided series for use in air combat by the usaf as well. a disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching fighter plane at a time. also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in air-to-air combat.
an active-radar variant called the sparrow ii was developed to address these drawbacks, but the u.s. navy pulled out of the project in 1956. the royal canadian air force, which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective cf-105 arrow interceptor, soon followed in 1958. the electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make sparrow ii a viable working weapon. it would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the sparrow.
the us navy later developed the aim-54 phoenix long-range missile (lrm) for the fleet air defense mission. it was a large , mach 5 missile designed to counter cruise missiles and the bombers that launched them. originally intended for the straight-wing douglas f6d missileer and then the navalized version of the f-111b, it finally saw service with the grumman f-14 tomcat, the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. phoenix was the first us fire-and-forget, multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. this, in theory, gave a tomcat with a six-phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as away—the only us fighter with such capability.
a full load of six phoenix missiles and its dedicated launcher exceeded a typical vietnam-era bomb load. its service in the us navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive rules of engagement in conflicts such as operations desert storm, southern watch, and iraqi freedom. the us navy retired the phoenix in 2004 in light of availability of the aim-120 amraam on the f/a-18 hornet and the pending retirement of the f-14 tomcat from active service in late 2006.
the department of defense conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at nellis afb using the f-14 tomcat and f-15 eagle equipped with sparrow and sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor f-5e aircraft equipped with aim-9l all-aspect sidewinders as the red force. this joint test and evaluation (jt&e) was designated air combat evaluation/air intercept missile evaluation (aceval/aimval). a principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. what was needed was phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a sparrow-size airframe. this led to a memorandum of agreement (moa) with european allies (principally the uk and germany for development) for the us to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the usaf as lead service. the moa also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the european team; this would become the british asraam.
by the 1990s, the reliability of the sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in desert storm. but while the usaf had passed on the phoenix and their own similar aim-47/yf-12 to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the f-15 and f-16. amraam would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the f-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the sparrow on the f-4 phantom. the european partners needed amraam to be integrated on aircraft as small as the sea harrier. the us navy needed amraam to be carried on the f/a-18 hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.
the amraam became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new f-22 raptor fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low radar cross-section.
amraam was developed as the result of an agreement (the family of weapons moa, no longer in effect by 1990), among the united states and several other nato nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. under this agreement the u.s. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (amraam) and europe would develop the next generation short range missile (asraam). although europe initially adopted the amraam, an effort to develop the meteor, a competitor to amraam, was begun in great britain. eventually the asraam was developed solely by the british, but using another source for its infrared seeker. after protracted development, the deployment of amraam (aim-120a) began in september 1991 in us air force f-15 eagle fighter squadrons. the us navy soon followed (in 1993) in its f/a-18 hornet squadrons.
the eastern counterpart of amraam is the somewhat similar russian air force aa-12 "adder", sometimes referred to in the west as the "amraamski." likewise, france began its own air-to-air missile development with the mica concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.
amraam has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (bvr) capability. it improves the aerial combat capabilities of us and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. amraam serves as a follow-on to the aim-7 sparrow missile series. the new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. it also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. an inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.
once the missile closes in on the target, its active radar guides it to intercept. this feature, known as "fire-and-forget", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.
the missile also features the ability to "home on jamming," giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing – homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.
amraam uses two-stage guidance when fired at long range. the aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. the missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built-in inertial navigation system (ins). this information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an infra-red search and track system, from a data link from another fighter aircraft, or from an awacs aircraft.
after launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates—such as changes in the target's direction and speed—are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to "catch" the target aircraft in the "basket" (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).
not all armed services using the amraam have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits amraam's effectiveness in some scenarios. the raf initially opted not to use mid-course update for its tornado f3 force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the amraam was less effective in beyond visual range (bvr) engagements than the older semi-active radar homing bae skyflash weapon—the aim-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.
once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. if the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. if the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (wvr) or the near bvr, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly "fire and forget".
apart from the radar-slaved mode, there is a free guidance mode, called "visual". this mode is radar guidance-free -- the missile just fires and locks onto the first thing it sees. this mode can be used for defensive shots, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority.
the kill probability (p) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. this chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. operationally, the missile, which was designed for beyond visual range combat, has a p of 63.15% (19 missiles for 12 kills, including the syrian su-22 downed by a us navy f/a-18e). the targets included six mig-29s, a mig-25, a mig-23, two su-22s, a galeb and a us army blackhawk that was targeted by mistake.
there are currently four main variants of amraam, all in service with the united states air force, united states navy, and the united states marine corps. the aim-120a is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor aim-120b. the aim-120c has smaller "clipped" aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the usaf f-22 raptor. aim-120b deliveries began in 1994.
the aim-120c deliveries began in 1996. the c-variant has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. the aim-120c-6 contained an improved fuse (target detection device) compared to its predecessor. the aim-120c-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). it was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers. it helped the u.s. navy replace the f-14 tomcats with f/a-18e/f super hornets – the loss of the f-14's long-range aim-54 phoenix missiles (already retired) is offset with a longer-range amraam-d. the lighter weight of the advanced amraam enables an f/a-18e/f pilot greater bring-back weight upon carrier landings.
the aim-120d is an upgraded version of the amraam with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already-extended range aim-120c-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability (p). raytheon began testing the d model on august 5, 2008, the company reported that an aim-120d launched from an f/a-18f super hornet passed within lethal distance of a qf-4 target drone at the white sands missile range. the range of the aim-120d is classified, but is thought to extend to about .
the aim-120d (p3i phase 4, formerly known as aim-120c-8) is a development of the aim-120c with a two-way data link, more accurate navigation using a gps-enhanced imu, an expanded no-escape envelope, and improved hobs (high off-boresight) capability. the aim-120d max speed is mach 4 and aim-120d is a joint usaf/usn project, and is currently in the testing phase. the usn was scheduled to field it from 2014, and aim-120d will be carried by all pacific carrier groups by 2020, although the 2013 sequestration cuts could push back this later date to 2022. the royal australian air force requested 450 aim-120d missiles, which would make it the first foreign operator of the missile. the procurement, approved by the us government in april 2016, will cost $1.1 billion and will be integrated for use on the f/a-18f super hornet, ea-18g growler and the f-35 lightning ii aircraft.
there are also plans for raytheon to develop a ramjet-powered derivative of the amraam, the future medium range air-air missile (fmraam). it is not known whether the fmraam will be produced since the target market, the british ministry of defence, has chosen the meteor missile over the fmraam for a bvr missile for the eurofighter typhoon aircraft.
raytheon is also working with the missile defense agency to develop the network centric airborne defense element (ncade), an anti-ballistic missile derived from the aim-120. this weapon will be equipped with a ramjet engine and an infrared homing seeker derived from the sidewinder missile. in place of a proximity-fused warhead, the ncade will use a kinetic energy hit-to-kill vehicle based on the one used in the navy's rim-161 standard missile 3.
the -120a and -120b models are currently nearing the end of their service life while the -120d variant has just entered full production. amraam was due to be replaced by the usaf, the u.s. navy, and the u.s. marine corps after 2020 by the joint dual role air dominance missile (next generation missile). this was unexpectedly terminated in the 2013 budget plan, and so the future replacement is uncertain.
in 2017, exploratory work on a replacement called long-range engagement weapon was started.
raytheon successfully tested launching amraam missiles from a five-missile carrier on a m1097 humvee. this system will be known as the slamraam (surface launched (sl) and amraam). they receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle. since the missile is launched without the benefit of an aircraft's speed or high altitude, its range is considerably shorter. raytheon is currently marketing an sl-amraam ex, purported to be an extended range amraam and bearing a resemblance to the rim-162 essm.
the norwegian advanced surface-to-air missile system (nasams), developed by kongsberg defence & aerospace, consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six amraams each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles. a more recent version of the program is the "high mobility launcher", made in cooperation with raytheon (kongsberg defence & aerospace was already a subcontractor on the slamraam system), where the launch-vehicle is a humvee (m1152a1 hmmwv), containing four amraams each.
while still under evaluation for replacement of current us army assets, the sl-amraam has been deployed in several nations' military forces. the united arab emirates (uae) has requested the purchasing of sl-amraam as part of a larger $7 billion foreign military sales package. the sale would include 288 amraam c-7 missiles.
the us army has test fired the sl-amraam from a himars artillery rocket launcher as a common launcher, as part of a move to switch to a larger and more survivable launch platform.
on january 6, 2011, secretary of defense robert gates announced that the u.s. army has decided to terminate acquisition of the slamraam as part of a budget-cutting effort.
the national guard association of the united states has sent a letter asking for the united states senate to stop the army's plan to drop the slamraam program because without it there would be no path to modernize the guard's an/twq-1 avenger battalions.
on february 22, 2015 raytheon announced an extended range upgrade to nasams-launched amraam, calling it amraam-er. this combines the amraam seeker with the essm rocket motor.
the amraam was used for the first time on december 27, 1992, when a usaf f-16d shot down an iraqi mig-25 that violated the southern no-fly-zone. this missile had been returned from the flight line as defective a day earlier. amraam gained a second victory in january 1993 when an iraqi mig-23 was shot down by a usaf f-16c.
the third combat use of the amraam was in 1994, when a republika srpska air force j-21 jastreb aircraft was shot down by a usaf f-16c that was patrolling the un-imposed no-fly zone over bosnia. in that engagement, at least three other serbian aircraft were shot down by usaf f-16c fighters using aim-9 missiles (see banja luka incident for more details). at that point, three launches in combat had resulted in three kills, resulting in the amraam's being informally named "slammer" in the second half of the 1990s.
in 1998 and 1999 amraams were again fired by usaf f-15 fighters at iraqi aircraft violating the no-fly-zone, but this time they failed to hit their targets. during the spring of 1999, amraams saw their main combat action during operation allied force, the kosovo bombing campaign. six serbian mig-29 were shot down by nato (four usaf f-15cs, one usaf f-16c, and one dutch f-16a mlu), all of them using aim-120 missiles (the supposed kill by the f-16c may have actually been friendly fire, an sa-7 manpads fired by serbian infantry).
on 18 june 2017, a us f/a-18e super hornet engaged and shot down a sukhoi su-22 of the syrian air force over northern syria, using an aim-120. the su-22 had previously avoided an aim-9x sidewinder by using flares.
as of 2017, the aim-120 amraam has shot down eleven aircraft (six mig-29s, one mig-25, one mig-23, one su-22, one soko j-21 jastreb, and one uh-60 black hawks). the latter was a friendly fire incident in 1994 when f-15 fighters patrolling iraq's northern no-fly zone inadvertently shot down a pair of u.s. army black hawk helicopters.
in august 7, 2018, a spanish air force eurofighter typhoon accidentally launched a missile in estonia. there were no human casualties, but a ten-day search operation for missile remains was unsuccessful.
on feb 27, 2019, a pakistan air force f16 shot down a mig-21 bison by launching a missile in pakistan. an indian air force officer was captured by pakistan but returned next day to india. indian airforce officials showed fragments of what they believed were aim-120c-5
canadair, now bombardier, had largely helped with the development of the aim-7 sparrow and sparrow ii, and assisted to a lesser extent in the aim-120 development. canada had placed an order for 256 aim-120's, but cancelled half of them after engine ignition problems due to cold weather conditions. the aim-9x & aim-7 were ordered as replacements.
in early 1995 south korea ordered 88 aim-120a missiles for its kf-16 fleet. in 1997 south korea ordered 737 additional aim-120b missiles.
in 2006 poland received aim-120c-5 missiles to arm its new f-16c/d block 52+ fighters.
in early 2006, the pakistan air force (paf) ordered 500 aim-120c-5 amraam missiles as part of a $650 million f-16 ammunition deal to equip its f-16c/d block 50/52+ and f-16a/b block 15 mlu fighters. the paf got the first three f-16c/d block 50/52+ aircraft on july 3, 2010 and first batch of amraams on july 26, 2010.
in 2007, the united states government agreed to sell 218 aim-120c-7 missiles to taiwan as part of a large arms sales package that also included 235 agm-65g-2 maverick missiles. total value of the package, including launchers, maintenance, spare parts, support and training rounds, was estimated at around us$421 million. this supplemented an earlier taiwanese purchase of 120 aim-120c-5 missiles a few years ago.
2008 has brought announcements of new or additional sales to singapore, finland, morocco and south korea; in december 2010 the swiss government requested 150 aim-120c-7 missiles. sales to finland have stalled, because the manufacturer has not been able to fix a mysterious bug that causes the rocket motors of the missile to fail in cold tests. in may 5, 2015, the state department has made a determination approving a possible foreign military sale to royal malaysian air force for aim-120c7 amraam missiles and associated equipment, parts and logistical support for an estimated cost of $21 million.
in march 2016, the us government approved the sales of aim-120c-7 missiles to the indonesian air force to equip their fleet of f-16 c/d block 32+.

the agm-88 harm (high-speed anti-radiation missile) is a tactical, air-to-surface anti-radiation missile designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air radar systems. it was originally developed by texas instruments as a replacement for the agm-45 shrike and agm-78 standard arm system. production was later taken over by raytheon corporation when it purchased the defense production business of texas instruments.
the agm-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input. the proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. a smokeless, solid-propellant, booster-sustainer rocket motor propels the missile at speeds over mach 2.0. the harm missile was a program led by the u.s. navy, and it was first carried by the a-6e, a-7, and f/a-18a/b aircraft, and then it equipped the ea-6b aircraft. rdt&e for use on the f-14 aircraft was begun, but not completed.
the u.s. air force (usaf) put the harm onto the f-4g wild weasel aircraft, and later on specialized f-16s equipped with the harm targeting system (hts). the hts pod, used by the usaf, only, allows f-16 to detect and automatically target radars with harms instead of relying on the missile's sensors alone.
the harm missile was approved for full production in march 1983, obtained initial operating capability (ioc) on the a-7e corsair ii in late 1983 and then deployed in late 1985 with va-46 aboard the aircraft carrier uss "america". in 1986, the first successful firing of the harm from an ea-6b was performed by vaq-131. it was soon used in combat—in march 1986 against a libyan sa-5 site in the gulf of sidra, and then during operation eldorado canyon in april. harm was used extensively by the navy, marine corps, and the air force in operation desert storm during the persian gulf war of 1991.
during the gulf war, the harm was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an f-4g wild weasel escorting a b-52 bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an iraqi aaa site. (this was after the tail gunner of the b-52 had targeted the f-4g, mistaking it for an iraqi mig.) the f-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the b-52, which was hit. it survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. the b-52 was subsequently renamed "in harm's way".
"magnum" is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an agm-88. during the gulf war, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus "magnum" call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.
this technique would also be employed in serbia during air operations in 1999.
in 2013 president obama offered the agm-88 to israel for the first time.
the newest upgrade, the "agm-88e advanced antiradiation guided missile (aargm)," features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter enemy radar shutdown, and passive radar using an additional active millimeter-wave seeker. it was released in november 2010, and it is a joint venture by the us department of defense and the italian ministry of defense, produced by orbital atk.
in november 2005, the italian ministry of defense and the u.s. department of defense signed a memorandum of agreement on the joint development of the agm-88e aargm missile. italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several million dollars worth of material, equipment, and related services. the italian air force was expected to buy up to 250 missiles for its tornado ecr aircraft. a flight test program was set to integrate the aargm onto tornado ecr's weapon system.
the u.s. navy demonstrated the aargm's capability during initial operational test and evaluation (iot&e) in spring 2012 with live firing of 12 missiles. aircrew and maintenance training with live missiles was completed in june.
the navy authorized full-rate production (frp) of the aargm in august 2012, with 72 missiles for the navy and nine for the italian air force to be delivered in 2013. a u.s. marine corps f/a-18 hornet squadron will be the first forward-deployed unit with the agm-88e.
in september 2013, atk delivered the 100th aargm to the u.s. navy. the agm-88e program is on schedule and on budget, with full operational capability (foc) planned for september 2014. the agm-88e was designed to improve the effectiveness of legacy harm variants against fixed and relocatable radar and communications sites, particularly those that would shut down to throw off anti-radiation missiles, by attaching a new seeker to the existing mach 2-capable rocket motor and warhead section, adding a passive anti-radiation homing receiver, satellite and inertial navigation system, a millimeter-wave radar for terminal guidance, and the ability to beam up images of the target via a satellite link just seconds before impact.
this model of the harm will be integrated onto the f/a-18c/d, f/a-18e/f, ea-18g, and tornado ecr aircraft, and later on the f-35.
in september 2015, the agm-88e successfully hit a mobile ship target in a live-fire test, demonstrating the missile's ability to use antiradiation homing and millimeter-wave radar to detect, identify, locate, and engage moving targets.
although the u.s. chose the orbital atk-produced agm-88e, raytheon created its own version of the aargm called the agm-88f harm control section modification (hcsm), one which incorporates similar upgrade features, which could allow the company to offer their missile for export.
the navy's fy 2016 budget included funding for an extended range aargm-er that utilizes the existing guidance system and warhead of the agm-88e with a solid integrated rocket-ramjet for double the range. development funding will last to 2020. in september 2016, orbital atk unveiled its extended-range aargm-er, which incorporates a redesigned control section and -diameter rocket motor for twice the range and internal carriage on the lockheed martin f-35 lightning ii. the u.s. navy awarded orbital atk an contract for aargm-er development in january 2018.
the aargm-er would serve as the basis for the land-attack stand in attack weapon (siaw).

the agm-65 maverick is an air-to-ground missile (agm) designed for close air support. it is the most widely produced precision-guided missile in the western world, and is effective against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.
development began in 1966 at hughes as the first missile to use an electronic contrast seeker. it entered service with the united states air force in august 1972. since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. the maverick served during the vietnam, yom kippur, iran–iraq, and persian gulf wars, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.
since its introduction into service, numerous maverick versions had been designed and produced using electro-optical, laser, and imaging infrared guidance systems. the agm-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. the missile is currently produced by raytheon missile systems.
the maverick shares the same configuration as hughes's aim-4 falcon and aim-54 phoenix, and measures more than in length and in diameter.
the maverick's development history began in 1965, when the united states air force (usaf) began a program to develop a replacement to the agm-12 bullpup. with a range of , the radio-guided bullpup was introduced in 1959 and was considered a "silver bullet" by operators. however, the launch aircraft was required to fly straight towards the target during the missile's flight instead of performing evasive maneuvers, thus risking the crew. even when it hit, the small warhead was only useful against small targets like bunkers, when used against larger targets like the thanh hóa bridge it did little other than char the structure. the usaf began a series of projects to replace bullpup, both larger versions of bullpup, models c and d, as well as a series of bullpup adaptations offering fire-and-forget guidance. among the latter were the agm-83 bulldog, agm-79 blue eye and agm-80 viper.
from 1966 to 1968, hughes missile systems division and rockwell competed for the contract to build an entirely new fire-and-forget missile with far greater range performance than any of the bullpup versions. each were allocated $3 million for preliminary design and engineering work of the maverick in 1966. in 1968, hughes emerged with the $95 million contract for further development and testing of the missile; at the same time, contract options called for 17,000 missiles to be procured. hughes conducted a smooth development of the agm-65 maverick, with the first unguided test launch from a f-4 on 18 september 1969, with the first guided test on 18 december successfully performing a direct hit on a m41 tank target at the air force missile development center at holloman air force base, new mexico.
in july 1971, the usaf and hughes signed a $69.9 million contract for 2,000 missiles, the first of which was delivered in 1972. although early operational results were favorable, military planners predicted that the maverick would fare less successfully in the hazy conditions of central europe, where it would have been used against warsaw pact forces. as such, development of the agm-65b began in 1975 before it was delivered during the late 1970s. when production of the agm-65a/b was ended in 1978, more than 35,000 missiles had been built.
more versions of the maverick appeared, among which was the laser-guided agm-65c/e. development of the agm-65c started in 1978 by rockwell, who built a number of development missiles for the usaf. due to high cost, the version was not procured by the usaf, and instead entered service with the united states marine corps (usmc) as the agm-65e.
another major development was the agm-65d, which employed an imaging infrared (iir) seeker. by imaging on radiated heat, the iir is all-weather operable as well as showing improved performance in acquiring and tracking the hot engines, such as in tanks and trucks, that were to be one of its major missions. the seekerhead mechanically scanned the scene over a nitrogen-cooled 4-by-4 pixel array using a series of mirrored facets machined into the inner surface of the ring-shaped main gyroscope. the five-year development period of the agm-65d started in 1977 and ended with the first delivery to the usaf in october 1983. the version received initial operating capability in february 1986.
the agm-65f is a hybrid maverick combining the agm-65d's iir seeker and warhead and propulsion components of the agm-65e. deployed by the united states navy (usn), the agm-65f is optimized for maritime strike roles. the first agm-65f launch from the p-3c took place in 1989, and in 1994, the usn awarded unisys a contract to integrate the version with the p-3c. meanwhile, hughes produced the agm-65g, which essentially has the same guidance system as the d, with some software modifications that track larger targets, coupled with a shaped-charge warhead.
in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, there were several ideas of enhancing the maverick's potential. among them was the stillborn plan to incorporate the maverick millimeter wave active radar homing, which can determine the exact shape of a target. another study called "longhorn project" was conducted by hughes, and later raytheon following the absorption of hughes into raytheon, looked a maverick version equipped with turbojet engines instead of rocket motors. the "maverick er", as it was dubbed, would have a "significant increase in range" compared to the maverick's current range of . the proposal was abandoned, but if the maverick er had entered production, it would have replaced the agm-119b penguin carried on the mh-60r.
the most modern versions of the maverick are the agm-65h/k, which were in production . the agm-65h was developed by coupling the agm-65b with a charge-coupled device (ccd) seeker optimized for desert operations and which has three times the range of the original tv-sensor; a parallel usn program aimed at rebuilding agm-65fs with newer ccd seekers resulted in the agm-65j. the agm-65k, meanwhile, was developed by replacing the agm-65g's ir guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system.
the maverick has a modular design, allowing for different combinations of the guidance package and warhead to be attached to the rocket motor to produce a different weapon. it has long-chord delta wings and a cylindrical body, reminiscent of the aim-4 falcon and the aim-54 phoenix.
different models of the agm-65 have used electro-optical, laser, and imaging infrared guidance systems. the agm-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. the latter is most effective against large, hard targets. the propulsion system for both types is a solid-fuel rocket motor behind the warhead.
the maverick missile is unable to lock onto targets on its own; it has to be given input by the pilot or weapon systems officer (wso) after which it follows the path to the target autonomously. in an a-10 thunderbolt ii, for example, the video feed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. a crosshair on the heads-up display is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target, where the missile will then automatically recognize and lock on to the target. once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. this fire-and-forget property is not shared by the e version that uses semi-active laser homing.
the maverick was declared operational on 30 august 1972 with the f-4d/es and a-7s initially cleared for the type; the missile made its combat debut four months later with the usaf in the vietnam war. during the yom kippur war in october 1973, the israelis used mavericks to destroy and disable enemy vehicles. deployment of early versions of the mavericks in these two wars were successful due to the favorable atmospheric conditions that suited the electro-optical tv seeker. ninety-nine missiles were fired during the two wars, eighty-four of which were successful.
in june 1975, during a border confrontation, a formation of iranian f4e phantoms destroyed a group of iraqi tanks by firing 12 mavericks at them. five years later, during operation "pearl" as part of the iran–iraq war, iranian f-4s used mavericks to sink three osa ii missile boats and four p-6 combat ships.
due to weapons embargoes, iran had to equip its ah-1j seacobra helicopters with agm-65 maverick missiles and used them with some success in various operations such as operation "undeniable victory" wherein iranian ah-1js fired 11 mavericks.
in august 1990, iraq invaded kuwait. in early 1991, the us-led coalition executed operation "desert storm" during which mavericks played a crucial role in the ousting of iraqi forces from kuwait. employed by f-15e strike eagles, f/a-18 hornets, av-8b harriers, f-16 fighting falcons and a-10 thunderbolt iis, but used mainly by the last two, more than 5,000 mavericks were used to attack armored targets. the most-used variant by the usaf was the iir-guided agm-65d. the reported hit rate by usaf mavericks was 80–90%, while for the usmc it was 60%. the maverick was used again in iraq during the 2003 iraq war, during which 918 were fired.
the first time the maverick were fired from a lockheed p-3 orion at a hostile vessel was when the usn and coalition units came to the aid of libyan rebels to engage the libyan coast guard vessel "vittoria" in the port of misrata, libya, during the late evening of 28 march 2011. "vittoria" was engaged and fired upon by a usn p-3c maritime patrol aircraft with agm-65 maverick missiles.
lau-117 maverick launchers have been used on us army, usn, usaf, and usmc aircraft:
the maverick has been exported to at least 35 countries:
according to the article on kh-23 grom the guidance system of the serbian grom-b is based on the maverick system.

the aim-54 phoenix is a radar-guided, long-range air-to-air missile (aam), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the grumman f-14 tomcat, its only operational launch platform. the phoenix was the united states' only long-range air-to-air missile. the combination of phoenix missile and the an/awg-9 guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets. due to its active radar tracking, the brevity code "fox three" was used when firing the aim-54.
both the missile and the aircraft were used by iran and the united states navy. in us service both are now retired, the aim-54 phoenix in 2004 and the f-14 in 2006. they were replaced by the shorter-range aim-120 amraam, employed on the f/a-18 hornet and f/a-18e/f super hornet—in its aim-120d version, the latest version of the amraam just matches the phoenix's maximum range.
the aim-54 is credited with 62 air-to-air kills, all scored by iran during the long iran–iraq war. following the retirement of the f-14 by the u.s. navy, the weapon's only current operator is the islamic republic of iran air force.
since 1951, the navy faced the initial threat from the tupolev tu-4k 'bull' carrying anti-ship missiles or nuclear bombs.
eventually, during the height of the cold war, the threat would have expanded into regimental-size raids of tu-16 badger and tu-22m backfire bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable electronic countermeasures (ecm) of various types. this combination was considered capable of saturating fleet defenses and threatening carrier groups.
the navy would require a long-range, long-endurance interceptor aircraft to defend carrier battle groups against this threat. the proposed f6d missileer was intended to fulfill this mission and oppose the attack as far as possible from the fleet it was defending. the weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the bendix aam-n-10 eagle, was to be an air-to-air missile of unprecedented range when compared to contemporary aim-7 sparrow missiles. it would work together with westinghouse an/apq-81 radar. the missileer project was cancelled in december 1960.
in the early 1960s, the u.s. navy made the next interceptor attempt with the f-111b, and they needed a new missile design. at the same time, the usaf canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, the north american xf-108 rapier and the lockheed yf-12, and left the capable aim-47 falcon missile at a quite advanced stage of development, but with no effective launch platform.
the aim-54 phoenix, developed for the f-111b fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with four cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the aim-47. one characteristic of the missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it mid-course corrections, which allowed the fire control system to "loft" the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.
the f-111b was canceled in 1968. its weapons system, the aim-54 working with the awg-9 radar, migrated to the new u.s. navy fighter project, the vfx, which would later become the f-14 tomcat.
in 1977, development of a significantly improved phoenix version, the aim-54c, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ecm.
the aim-54/awg-9 combination had multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to six phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large missile is equipped with a conventional warhead.
on the f-14, four missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus two under glove stations. a full load of six phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weighs in at over , about twice the weight of sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of two phoenix, three sparrow, and two sidewinder missiles.
most other us aircraft relied on the smaller, semi-active medium-range aim-7 sparrow. semi-active guidance meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched sparrow, reducing situational awareness.
the tomcat's radar could track up to 24 targets in track-while-scan mode, with the awg-9 selecting up to six potential targets for the missiles. the pilot or radar intercept officer (rio) could then launch the phoenix missiles once parameters were met. the large tactical information display (tid) in the rio's cockpit gave information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the rio's display) and the radar could continually search and track multiple targets after phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining situational awareness of the battlespace.
the link 4 datalink allowed us navy tomcats to share information with the e-2c hawkeye aew aircraft. during desert shield in 1990, the link 4a was introduced; this allowed the tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. the f-14d entered service with the jtids that brought the even better link 16 datalink "picture" to the cockpit.
the phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the f-14a/b awg-9 radar (apg-71 radar in the f-14d) as it climbs to cruise between and at close to mach 5. the phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. at around from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. minimum engagement range for the phoenix is around and active homing would initiate upon launch.
the aim-54 phoenix was retired from usn service on september 30, 2004. f-14 tomcats were retired on september 22, 2006. they were replaced by shorter-range aim-120 amraams, employed on the f/a-18e/f super hornet.
despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in us navy service, though a large number of kills were claimed by iranian f-14s during the iran–iraq war. the usaf f-15 eagle had responsibility for overland combat air patrol duties in operation desert storm in 1991, primarily because of the onboard f-15 iff capabilities. the tomcat did not have the requisite iff capability mandated by the jfacc to satisfy the rules of engagement to utilize the phoenix capability at beyond visual range. the aim-54 was not adopted by any foreign nation besides iran, or any other us armed service, and was not used on any aircraft other than the f-14.
there is very little information available regarding iran's use of its 79 f-14a tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most western outlets. the exception is a book released by osprey publishing titled "iranian f-14 tomcats in combat" by tom cooper and farzad bishop. most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews. reports vary on the use of the 285 missiles supplied to iran, during the iran–iraq war (1980–1988), and achieving at least 78 victories against iraqi mig-21/23/25s, mirage f-1s, super étendards, and even one am-39 exocet and one c-601 anti-ship cruise missiles.
the us refused to supply spare parts and maintenance after the 1979 revolution, except for a brief period during the iran-contra affair. according to cooper, the islamic republic of iran air force kept its f-14 fighters and aim-54 missiles in regular use during the entire iran–iraq war, though periodic lack of spares grounded large parts of the fleet at times. during late 1987, the stock of aim-54 missiles was at its lowest, with fewer than 50 operational missiles available. the missiles needed fresh thermal batteries that could only be purchased from the us. iran found a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries, which cost up to us$10,000 each. iran received spares and parts for both the f-14s and aim-54s from various sources during the iran–iraq war, and has received more spares after the conflict. iran started a program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its f-14s and aim-54s operational, there is evidence that iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.
both the f-14 tomcat and aim-54 phoenix missile continue in the service of the islamic republic of iran air force. iran claimed to be working on building an equivalent missile and in 2013 unveiled the fakour-90, an upgraded and reverse-engineered version of the phoenix.
there were also test, evaluation, ground training, and captive air training versions of the missile; designated atm-54, aem-54, datm-54a, and catm-54. the flight versions had a and c versions. the datm-54 was not made in a c version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.
the following is a list of aim-54 phoenix specifications:

the lockheed ac-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the c-130 hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft. it carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the ac-130 relies on visual targeting. because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night.
the airframe is manufactured by lockheed martin, while boeing is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. developed during the vietnam war as "project gunship ii", the ac-130 replaced the douglas ac-47 spooky, or "gunship i". the sole operator is the united states air force, which uses the ac-130u spooky and ac-130w stinger ii variants for close air support, air interdiction, and force protection, with the upgraded ac-130j ghostrider entering service. close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting convoys, and urban operations. air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. force protection missions include defending air bases and other facilities. ac-130us are based at hurlburt field, florida, while ac-130ws are based at cannon afb, new mexico; gunships can be deployed worldwide. the squadrons are part of the air force special operations command (afsoc), a component of the united states special operations command (socom).
the ac-130 has an unpressurized cabin, with the weaponry mounted to fire from the port side of the fuselage. during an attack, the gunship performs a pylon turn, flying in a large circle around the target, therefore being able to fire at it for far longer than in a conventional strafing attack. the ac-130h spectre was armed with two m61 vulcan cannons, one l60 bofors 40 mm cannon, and one m102 howitzer; after 1994, the cannons were removed. the upgraded ac-130u spooky has a single gau-12 equalizer cannon in place of the spectre's two cannons, an improved fire control system, and increased ammunition capacity. the new ac-130j was based on the mc-130j commando ii special operations tanker. the ac-130w stinger ii is a modified c-130h with upgrades including a precision strike package.
during the vietnam war, the c-130 hercules was selected to replace the douglas ac-47 spooky gunship (project gunship i) in order to improve mission endurance and increase capacity to carry munitions. capable of flying faster than helicopters and at high altitudes with excellent loiter time, the use of the pylon turn allowed the ac-47 to deliver continuous accurate fire to a single point on the ground.
in 1967, jc-130a 54-1626 was selected for conversion into the prototype ac-130a gunship (project gunship ii). the modifications were done at wright-patterson air force base by the aeronautical systems division. a direct view night vision telescope was installed in the forward door, an early forward looking infrared device in the forward part of the left wheel well, with miniguns and rotary cannons fixed facing down and aft along the left side. the analog fire control computer prototype was handcrafted by raf wing commander tom pinkerton at the usaf avionics laboratory at wright-patterson afb. flight testing of the prototype was performed primarily at eglin air force base, followed by further testing and modifications. by september 1967, the aircraft was certified ready for combat testing and was flown to nha trang air base, south vietnam for a 90-day test program. the ac-130 was later supplemented by the ac-119 shadow (project gunship iii), which later proved to be underpowered.
seven more warplanes were converted to the "plain jane" configuration like the ac-130 prototype in 1968, and one aircraft received the "surprise package" refit in 1969. the surprise package upgrade included the latest 20 mm rotary autocannons and 40 mm bofors cannon but no 7.62 mm close support armament. the surprise package configuration served as a test bed for the avionic systems and armament for the ac-130e. in 1970, ten more ac-130as were acquired under the "pave pronto" project. in the summer of 1971, surprise package ac-130s were converted to the pave pronto configuration and assumed the new nickname of 'thor'. conversion of c-130es into ac-130es for the "pave spectre" project followed. regardless of their project names the aircraft were more commonly referred to by the squadron's call sign 'spectre'.
in 2007, air force special operations command (afsoc) initiated a program to upgrade the armament of ac-130s. the test program planned for the 25 mm gau-12/u and 40 mm bofors cannon on the ac-130u gunships to be replaced with two 30 mm mk 44 bushmaster ii cannons. in 2007, the air force modified four ac-130u gunships as test platforms for the bushmasters. these were referred to as ac-130u plus 4 or ac-130u+4. afsoc, however, canceled its plans to install the new cannons on its fleet of ac-130us. it has since removed the guns and re-installed the original 40 mm and 25 mm cannons and returned the planes to combat duty. brigadier general bradley a. heithold, afsoc's director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments, said on 11 august 2008 that the effort was canceled because of problems with the bushmaster's accuracy in tests "at the altitude we were employing it". there were also schedule considerations that drove the decision, he said.
there were also plans to possibly replace the 105 mm cannon with a breech-loading 120 mm m120 mortar, and to give the ac-130 a standoff capability using either the agm-114 hellfire missile, the advanced precision kill weapon system (based on the hydra 70 rocket), or the viper strike glide bomb.
in 2010, the air force awarded l-3 communications a $61 million contract to add precision strike packages to eight mc-130w combat spear special-mission aircraft to give them a gunship-like attack capability; such-equipped mc-130ws are known as "dragon spears". air force special operations command is arming these aircraft to relieve the high operational demands on ac-130 gunships until new ac-130js enter service. the mc-130w dragon spear was renamed ac-130w stinger ii in 2011. the precision strike packages consist of a 30 mm gun and several precision guided munitions (pgms). rails are mounted on the out-board pylon of the wing for four hellfire missiles, sdbs, or sdb iis under each. 10 common launch tubes (clts) are mounted on the rear ramp to fire griffin a missiles; additional missiles are stored in the aircraft that can be reloaded in flight. clts are able to fire other small munitions able to fit inside the -diameter, -long tubes.
the air force launched an initiative in 2011 to acquire 16 new gunships based on new-built mc-130j combat shadow ii special operations tankers outfitted with a "precision strike package" to give them an attack capability, requesting $1.6 billion from fiscal years 2011 through 2015. this would increase the size of the gunship fleet to 33 aircraft, a net increase of eight after the planned retirement of eight aging ac-130hs. the first aircraft would be bought in fiscal 2012, followed by two in fiscal 2013, five in fiscal 2014, and the final eight in fiscal 2015. the decision to retain the c-130 came after funding for 16 c-27js was removed from the fiscal 2010 budget.
the ac-130j will follow the path of the dragon spear program. on 9 january 2013, the air force began converting the first mc-130j combat shadow ii into an ac-130j ghostrider and delivered it to afsoc on 29 july 2015. the first ac-130j gunships achieved initial operational capability (ioc) on 30 september 2017. the ac-130j has two planned increments: the block 10 configuration includes an internal 30 mm gun, small diameter bombs, and laser-guided missiles launched from the rear cargo door; and block 20 configuration adds a 105 mm cannon, large aircraft infrared countermeasures, wing-mounted hellfire missiles, and radio-frequency countermeasures.
the air force decided to add a 105 mm cannon to the ac-130j in addition to the 30 mm cannon and smart bombs, the shells being more accurate and cheaper than dropping sdbs. afsoc is interested in adding a directed-energy weapon to the ac-130j by 2020, similar to the previous advanced tactical laser program. it is to produce a beam of up to 120 kw, or potentially even 180–200 kw, weigh about , defensively destroy anti-aircraft missiles, and offensively engage communications towers, boats, cars, and aircraft. however, laser armament may only be installed on a few aircraft rather than the entire ac-130j fleet; the laser will be mounted on the side in place of the 30 mm cannon. other potential additions include an active denial system to perform airborne crowd control, and small unmanned aerial vehicles from the common launch tubes to provide remote video feed and coordinates to weapons operators through cloud cover. called the tactical off-board sensor (tobs), the drones would be expendable and fly along a pre-programmed orbit to verify targets the aircraft can't see itself because of bad weather or standing off from air defenses. afsoc will initially utilize the raytheon coyote small uav for the tobs mission, as it is an off-the-shelf design with a one-hour endurance, but plans to fulfill the role with a new drone capable of a four-hour endurance by 2019.
the air force was also interested in acquiring a glide bomb that can be launched from the common launch tubes capable of hitting ground vehicles traveling as fast as 120 km/h (70 mph) while above . in june 2016, dynetics was awarded a contract by socom to integrate its tactical munition onto the ac-130. designated the gbu-69/b small glide munition, the weapon weighs and is armed with a blast-fragmentation warhead that can detonate by direct impact or at a pre-selected height; despite being smaller, being unpowered allows more volume for its warhead to be heavier than those on the hellfire and griffin a missiles, and respectively. guidance is provided by a gps receiver with anti-spoofing software and four distributed aperture semi-active laser seeker (dasals) apertures adapted from the wgu-59/b apkws for terminal guidance. approval for fielding occurred in early 2017. dynetics was awarded a contract to deliver an initial batch of 70 sgms in june 2017, with plans to buy up to 1,000. the sgm can travel .
by 2018, ac-130 gunships will have been providing close air support for special operators for 50 years. although the aircraft have been kept relevant through constant upgrades to their weaponry, sensor packages, and countermeasures, they are not expected to be survivable in future non-permissive environments due to their high signatures and low airspeeds. military analysts, such as the center for strategic and budgetary assessments, have suggested that afsoc invest in more advanced technologies to fill the role to operate in future contested combat zones, including a mix of low-cost disposable unmanned and stealthy strike aircraft.
the ac-130 is a heavily armed long-endurance aircraft carrying an array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. it is capable of delivering precision firepower or area-saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time, at night or in adverse weather. the sensor suite consists of a television sensor, infrared sensor, and radar. these sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.
the ac-130u is equipped with the an/apq-180, a synthetic aperture radar for long-range target detection and identification. the gunship's navigational devices include inertial navigation systems and a global positioning system. the ac-130u employs technologies developed in the 1990s which allow it to attack two targets simultaneously. it has twice the munitions capacity of the ac-130h. although the ac-130u conducts some operations in daylight, most of its combat missions are conducted at night. the ac-130h's unit cost is us$132.4 million, and the ac-130u's cost is us$190 million (fiscal 2001 dollars).
during the vietnam war era, the various ac-130 versions following the pave pronto modifications were equipped with a magnetic anomaly detector system called black crow (designated an/asd-5), a highly sensitive passive device with a phased-array antenna located in the left-front nose radome that could pick up localized deviations in the earth's magnetic field normally used to detect submerged submarines. the black crow system was slaved into the targeting computers of the ac-130a/e/h, enabling the detection of the unshielded ignition coils of north vietnamese trucks hidden under dense jungle foliage along the ho chi minh trail. it could also detect hand-held transmitter signals of air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets.
the pgm-38/u enhanced 25 mm high explosive incendiary round was created to expand the ac-130u gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25 mm gau-12/u gun. this round is a combination of the existing pgu-25 hei and a m758 fuze designated as fmu-151/b to meet the mil-std-1316. the fmu-151 has an improved arming delay with multi-sensitive range.
the ac-130 gunship first arrived in south vietnam on 21 september 1967 under the gunship ii program and began combat operations over laos and south vietnam that year. in june 1968, ac-130s were deployed to tan son nhut ab near saigon for support against the tet offensive. by 30 october 1968, enough ac-130 gunship iis arrived to form a squadron, the 16th special operations squadron (sos) of the 8th tactical fighter wing (tfw), at ubon royal thai air force base, thailand. it was at this time that the c-130a gunship was designated the ac-130a.
on 18 august 1968, an ac-130 gunship flying an armed reconnaissance mission in vietnam's iii corps was diverted to support the katum special forces camp. the ground commander quickly assessed the accurate fire and capabilities of this weapon system and called for fire on his own perimeter when the viet cong attempted to bridge the wire on the west side of his position.
by december 1968, most ac-130s flew under f-4 phantom ii escort (to protect the gunship against heavy and concentrated aaa fire) from the 497th tactical fighter squadron, normally three phantoms per gunship. on 24 may 1969, the first spectre gunship was lost to enemy fire.
in late 1969, under code name "surprise package", 56-0490 arrived with solid-state laser-illuminated low-light-level-tv with a companion yag laser designator, an improved forward looking infrared (flir) sensor, video recording for tv and flir, an inertial navigation system, and a prototype digital fire control computer. the remaining ac-130s were refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to ubon rtafb. on 25 october 1971, the first "cadillac" gunship, the ac-130e arrived in vietnam. on 17 february 1972, the first 105 mm cannon arrived for service with spectre and was installed on gunship 570. it was used from mid-february until the aircraft received battle damage to its right flap. the cannon was switched to gunship 571 and was used until 30 march when the aircraft was shot down.
on 28 january 1973, the vietnam peace accord went into effect, marking the end of spectre operations in vietnam. spectre was still needed and active in the region, supporting operations in laos and cambodia. on 22 february 1973, american offensive operations in laos ended and the gunships became totally committed to operations in the cambodian conflict.
on 12 april 1975, the khmer rouge were threatening the capital of phnom penh and ac-130s were called on to help in operation eagle pull, the final evacuation of american and allied officials from phnom penh before it was conquered by the communists. the ac-130 was also over saigon on 30 april 1975 to protect the final evacuation in operation frequent wind. spectres were also called in when the ss mayaguez was seized, on the open sea, by khmer rouge soldiers and sailors on 15 may 1975.
six ac-130s and 52 air crew members were lost during the war. ac-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close air support missions in vietnam.
with the conclusion of hostilities in southeast asia in the mid-1970s, the ac-130h became the sole gunship in the regular air force, home based at hurlburt field, florida, while the ac-130a fleet was transferred to the air force reserve's 919th tactical airlift group (919 tag) at eglin afb auxiliary field #3/duke field, florida. with the transition to the ac-130a, the 919 tag was then redesignated as the 919th special operations group (919 sog).
in the late 1970s, when the ac-130h fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from hurlburt field, florida, non-stop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over empire firing range in the republic of panama, then return home. this 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from kc-135 tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the contiguous united states to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.
ac-130s from both the 4th and 16th special operations squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict the united states has been involved in, officially and unofficially, since the end of the vietnam war.
in july 1979, ac-130h crews deployed to howard air force base, panama, as a precaution against possible hostile actions against american personnel during the nicaraguan revolution. new time aloft and non-stop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th sos 2-ship ac-130h formation flight that departed hurlburt field on 13 november 1979 and landed on 15 november at andersen air force base, guam, a distance of and 29 hours 43 minutes non-stop, refueling four times in-flight. refueling support for the guam deployment was provided by kc-135 crews from the 305th air refueling wing from grissom afb, indiana.
in november 1979, four ac-130h gunships flew nonstop from hurlburt field to anderson afb, guam, because of the hostage situation at the embassy in iran. at guam, ac-130h crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. this deployment with the 1 sow/cc as task force commander was directed from the office of the cjcs for fear that iranian militants could begin executing american embassy personnel who had been taken hostage on 4 november. one early option considered ac-130h retaliatory punitive strikes deep within iran. later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 hurlburt-to-guam flight. upon return in march 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in egypt to support the ill-fated hostage rescue attempt.
during operation urgent fury in grenada in 1983, ac-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the point salines airfield via airdrop and air-land of friendly forces. the ac-130 aircrew earned the lieutenant general william h. tunner award for the mission.
the ac-130hs of the 16th special operations squadron unit maintained an ongoing rotation to howard ab, panama, monitoring activities in el salvador and other central american points of interest, with rules of engagement eventually permitting attacks on fmln targets. this commitment of maintainers and crews started in 1983 and lasted until 1990. the ac-130 is considered to have hastened the end of the salvadoran civil war in the 1980s. crews flew undercover missions from honduras and attacked guerrilla camps and concentrations.
ac-130s also had a primary role during the united states invasion of panama (named operation just cause) in 1989, when they destroyed panama defense force headquarters and numerous command-and-control facilities, and provided close air support for us ground troops. aircrews earned the mackay trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year, and the tunner award.
during the gulf war of 1990–91 (operations desert shield and desert storm), regular air force and air force reserve ac-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces, and battlefield interdiction. the primary interdiction targets were early warning/ground control intercept (ew/gci) sites along the southern border of iraq. at its standard altitude of 12,000 feet, the aircraft had a proven ability to engage moving ground targets. the first gunship to enter the battle of khafji helped stop a southbound iraqi armored column on 29 january 1991. one day later, three more gunships provided further aid to marines participating in the operation. the gunships attacked iraqi positions and columns moving south to reinforce their positions north of the city.
despite the threat of surface-to-air missiles (sams) and increasing visibility during the early morning hours of 31 january 1991, one ac-130h, af serial no. 69-6567, call-sign spirit 03, opted to stay to continue to protect the marines. a lone iraqi with a strela-2 manpads shot spirit 03 down, and all 14 crew members died.
the military has used ac-130 gunships during the humanitarian operations in somalia (operation restore hope and operation united shield) in 1992–93, operation uphold democracy in haiti in 1994. ac-130s took part in operation assured response in liberia in 1996 and in operation silver wake in 1997, the evacuation of american non-combatants from albania.
ac-130s took part in the nato missions in bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo during the 1990s.
the ac-130u gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any c-130 on 22 and 23 october 1997, when two ac-130u gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from hurlburt field, florida to taegu air base (daegu), south korea, being refueled seven times in the air by kc-135 tankers. the two gunships took on 410,000 lb (186,000 kg) of fuel. gunships also were part of the buildup of u.s. forces in 1998 to compel iraq to allow unscom weapons inspections.
the u.s. has used gunships with deployments to the war in afghanistan (operation enduring freedom – afghanistan) (2001–2014), and iraq war (operation iraqi freedom) (2003–11). ac-130 strikes were directed by special forces on known taliban locations during the early days of the war in afghanistan. u.s. special operations forces are using the ac-130 to support its operations. the day after arriving in afghanistan, the ac-130s attacked taliban and al-qaeda forces near the city of konduz and were directly responsible for the city's surrender the next day. on 26 november 2001, spectres were called in to put down a rebellion at the prison fort of qala-i-janghi. the 16 sos flew missions over mazar-i-sharif, kunduz, kandahar, shkin, asadabad, bagram, baghran, tora bora, and virtually every other part of afghanistan. the spectre participated in countless operations within afghanistan, performing on-call close air support and armed reconnaissance. in march 2002, three ac-130 spectres provided 39 crucial combat missions in support of operation anaconda in afghanistan. during the intense fighting, the planes fired more than 1,300 40 mm and 1,200 105 mm rounds.
close air support was the main mission of the ac-130 in iraq. night after night, at least one ac-130 was in the air to fulfill one or more air support requests (asrs). a typical mission had the ac–130 supporting a single brigade's asrs followed by aerial refueling and another two hours with another brigade or sof team. the use of ac-130s in places like fallujah, urban settings where insurgents were among crowded populations of non-combatants, was criticized by human rights groups. ac-130s were also used for intelligence gathering with their sophisticated long-range video, infrared and radar sensors. in 2007, us special operations forces also used the ac-130 in attacks on suspected al-qaeda militants in somalia.
there were eight ac-130h and seventeen ac-130u aircraft in active-duty service as of july 2010. in march 2011, the u.s. air force deployed two ac-130u gunships to take part in operation odyssey dawn, the u.s. military intervention in libya, which eventually came under nato as operation unified protector.
by september 2013, 14 mc-130w dragon spear aircraft have been converted to ac-130w stinger ii gunships. the stinger gunships have been deployed to afghanistan to replace the aging ac-130h aircraft and provide an example for the new ac-130j ghostrider. modifications began with crews cutting holes in the plane to make room for weapons, and adding kits and bomb bases for laser-guided munitions. crews added a 105 mm cannon, 20-inch infrared and electro-optical sensors, and the ability to carry 250-pound bombs on the wings.
on 15 november 2015, two days after the attacks in paris by isil, ac-130s and a-10 thunderbolt ii attack aircraft destroyed a convoy of over 100 isil-operated oil tanker trucks in syria. the attacks were part of an intensification of the u.s.-led military intervention against isil called operation tidal wave ii (named after the original operation tidal wave during world war ii, a failed attempt to raid german oil fields that resulted in heavy aircraft and aircrew loss) in an attempt to cut off oil smuggling as a source of funding for the group.
on 3 october 2015, an ac-130 mistakenly attacked the doctors without borders hospital in kunduz, afghanistan. in five separate runs, the gunship struck the hospital that was erroneously identified as the source of attacks on coalition members. subsequent inquiries led to punishment of 16 military personnel and cited "human error" as the root cause.
on 30 september 2017, the air force declared the ac-130j ghostrider had achieved initial operational capability (ioc), with six gunships having been delivered; the aircraft is planned to reach full operational capability by 2023 with a total of 37 gunships delivered. the j-variant is lighter and more fuel efficient than previous versions, able to fly at with a range of and service ceiling of .
one of the first seven ac-130a aircraft deployed to vietnam was af serial no. 53-3129, named "first lady" in november 1970. this aircraft was a conversion of the first production c-130. on 25 march 1971, it took an anti-aircraft artillery hit in the belly just aft of the nose gear wheel well over the ho chi minh trail in laos. the 37 mm shell destroyed everything below the crew deck and barely missed striking two crew members. the pilot was able to crash land the aircraft safely. in 1975, after the conclusion of us involvement in the vietnam war, it was transferred to the air force reserve, where it served with the 711th special operations squadron of the 919th special operations wing. in 1980, the aircraft was upgraded from the original three-bladed propellers to the quieter four-bladed propellers and was eventually retired in late 1995. the retirement also marked an end to the air force reserve command flying the ac-130a. the aircraft now sits on display in the final air force reserve command configuration with grey paint, black markings, and the four-bladed hamilton sunstrand 54h60-91 props at the air force armament museum at eglin air force base, florida, usa.
a second aircraft, af serial no. 56-0509, named the "ultimate end", was originally accepted as an c-130a by the air force on 28 february 1957, and modified to the ac-130a configuration on 27 july 1970. the aircraft participated in the vietnam war and the rescue of the ss mayaguez. "ultimate end" demonstrated the durability of the c-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37 mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 december 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 april 1971 and a 57 mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 march 1972. "ultimate end" was reassigned to the air force reserve's 919th special operations wing at eglin afb auxiliary field no.3 / duke field on 17 june 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to air force special operations command's "heritage air park" at hurlburt field, florida. while assigned to the 711th special operations squadron, "ultimate end" served in operations just cause in panama, desert storm in kuwait and iraq, and uphold democracy in haiti. after 36 years and seven months of service, 24 years as a gunship, "ultimate end" retired from active service on 1 october 1994. it made its last flight from duke field to hurlburt field on 20 october 1994. the spectre association dedicated "ultimate end" (which served with the 16 sos in vietnam) on 4 may 1995. lt col michael byers, then 16 sos commander, represented the active-duty gunship force and clyde gowdy of the spectre association represented all spectre personnel past and present for the unveiling of a monument at the aircraft and the dedication as a whole.
a third ac-130a, af serial no. 54-1630, is on display in the cold war gallery at the national museum of the united states air force at wright-patterson afb, ohio. named "azrael" for the angel of death in islam who severs the soul from the body, this aircraft figured prominently in the closing hours of operation desert storm. on 26 february 1991, coalition ground forces were driving the iraqi army out of kuwait. with an air force reserve crew called to active duty, azrael was sent to the al jahra highway (highway 80) between kuwait city and basra, iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle. facing sa-6 and sa-8 surface-to-air missiles and 37 mm and 57 mm radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery the crew attacked and destroyed or disabled most of the convoys. "azrael" was also assigned to the 919th special operations wing and retired to the museum in october 1995.
another ac-130a, af serial no. 54-1626, the original prototype ac-130 named "gunship ii" is on display at the outdoor air park at the national museum of the united states air force at wright-patterson afb, ohio. this aircraft served in southeast asia from 1967 to 1972, then served in jc-130a test configuration. it was transferred to the national museum of the united states air force in 1976, and converted back to ac-130a configuration in the late 1990s.
ac-130a serial no. 54-1623, c/n 3010, named "ghost rider" served in southeast asia and later conflicts until being retired in 1997 to dobbins afb, georgia. ghost rider eventually was transferred and displayed at the aviation wing museum at marietta, georgia.

alternative or alternate may refer to:

in abstract algebra, an alternative algebra is an algebra in which multiplication need not be associative, only alternative. that is, one must have
for all "x" and "y" in the algebra.
every associative algebra is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly non-associative algebras such as the octonions.
alternative algebras are so named because they are the algebras for which the associator is alternating. the associator is a trilinear map given by
by definition, a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal. the left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to
both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally skew-symmetric. that is,
for any permutation σ. it follows that
for all "x" and "y". this is equivalent to the "flexible identity"
the associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. by symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:
is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.
an alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. the converse holds so long as the characteristic of the base field is not 2.
artin's theorem states that in an alternative algebra the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. it follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written unambiguously without parentheses in an alternative algebra. a generalization of artin's theorem states that whenever three elements formula_12 in an alternative algebra associate (i.e., formula_13), the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.
a corollary of artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are power-associative, that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative. the converse need not hold: the sedenions are power-associative but not alternative.
the moufang identities
hold in any alternative algebra.
in a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. moreover, for any invertible element formula_17 and all formula_18 one has
this is equivalent to saying the associator formula_20 vanishes for all such formula_17 and formula_18. if formula_17 and formula_18 are invertible then formula_25 is also invertible with inverse formula_26. the set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a moufang loop. this "loop of units" in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the group of units in an associative ring or algebra.
kleinfeld's theorem states that any simple non-associative alternative ring is a generalized octonion algebra over its center.
the structure theory of alternative rings is presented in .
the projective plane over any alternative division ring is a moufang plane.
the close relationship of alternative algebras and composition algebras was given by guy roos in 2008: he shows (page 162) the relation for an algebra "a" with unit element "e" and an involutive anti-automorphism formula_27 such that "a" + "a"* and "aa"* are on the line spanned by "e" for all "a" in "a". use the notation "n"("a") = "aa"*. then if "n" is a non-singular mapping into the field of "a", and "a" is alternative, then ("a,n") is a composition algebra.

in economics and finance, arbitrage (, ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. when used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. for example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.
in principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in statistical arbitrage, it may refer to "expected" profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). in academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a "single" asset or "identical" cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between "similar" assets (relative value or convergence trades), as in merger arbitrage.
people who engage in arbitrage are called arbitrageurs —such as a bank or brokerage firm. the term is mainly applied to trading in financial instruments, such as bonds, stocks, derivatives, commodities and currencies.
arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.
"arbitrage" is a french word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. (in modern french, "" usually means referee or umpire.) in the sense used here, it was first defined in 1704 by mathieu de la porte in his treatise "" as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognise the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange (" [, in modern spelling] ".)
if the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an arbitrage equilibrium, or an arbitrage-free market. an arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a general economic equilibrium. the "no arbitrage" assumption is used in quantitative finance to calculate a unique risk neutral price for derivatives.
this refers to the method of valuing a coupon-bearing financial instrument by discounting its future cash flows by multiple discount rates. by doing so, a more accurate price can be obtained than if the price is calculated with a present-value pricing approach. arbitrage-free pricing is used for bond valuation and to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors.
for the purpose of valuing the price of a bond, its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity, being the principal. since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods, they must be discounted back to the present. in the present-value approach, the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond. in arbitrage-free pricing, multiple discount rates are used.
the present-value approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity. this is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future, which in turn affects the yield on the bond. the discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason. each cash flow can be considered a zero-coupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity. the discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zero-coupon bonds with maturity dates the same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued. by using multiple discount rates, the arbitrage-free price is the sum of the discounted cash flows. arbitrage-free price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible.
the ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zero-coupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve. the yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. this curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. in arbitrage-free pricing of a bond, a yield curve of similar zero-coupon bonds with different maturities is created. if the curve were to be created with treasury securities of different maturities, they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. this is to transform the bonds into zero-coupon bonds. the yield of these zero-coupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the "x"-axis and yield on the "y"-axis.
since the yield curve displays market expectations on how yields and interest rates may move, the arbitrage-free pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate. investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices, resulting in an arbitrage opportunity. if a bond valued with the arbitrage-free pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market, an investor could have such an opportunity:
if the outcome from the valuation were the reversed case, the opposite positions would be taken in the bonds. this arbitrage opportunity comes from the assumption that the prices of bonds with the same properties will converge upon maturity. this can be explained through market efficiency, which states that arbitrage opportunities will eventually be discovered and corrected accordingly. the prices of the bonds in t move closer together to finally become the same at t.
arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:
arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. the transactions must occur "simultaneously" to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. in practical terms, this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved. missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.
in the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. traders may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. this type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. "true" arbitrage requires that there is no market risk involved. where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.
see rational pricing, particularly § arbitrage mechanics, for further discussion.
mathematically it is defined as follows:
where formula_2 and formula_3 denotes the portfolio value at time "t".
arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. as a result of arbitrage, the currency exchange rates, the price of commodities, and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge. the speed at which they do so is a measure of market efficiency. arbitrage tends to reduce price discrimination by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high (as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets).
arbitrage moves different currencies toward purchasing power parity. as an example, assume that a car purchased in the united states is cheaper than the same car in canada. canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. at the same time, americans would buy us cars, transport them across the border, then sell them in canada. canadians would have to buy american dollars to buy the cars and americans would have to sell the canadian dollars they received in exchange. both actions would increase demand for us dollars and supply of canadian dollars. as a result, there would be an appreciation of the us currency. this would make us cars more expensive and canadian cars less so until their prices were similar. on a larger scale, international arbitrage opportunities in commodities, goods, securities and currencies tend to change exchange rates until the purchasing power is equal.
in reality, most assets exhibit some difference between countries. these, transaction costs, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage. similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciation in the currencies relative to each other (see interest rate parity).
arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations, particularly financial crises, and can lead to bankruptcy. formally, arbitrage transactions have negative skew – prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. the day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). the rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via leverage (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.
the main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails – execution risk. the main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk – that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post margin and does not have the money to do so.
in the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as limits to arbitrage.
generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. however, this is not necessarily the case. many exchanges and inter-dealer brokers allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on liffe).
competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions. as an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between ibm on the nyse and ibm on the london stock exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the nyse and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the lse. this leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.
in the 1980s, risk arbitrage was common. in this form of speculation, one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. the standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price—if the merger goes through as predicted. traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. at some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). when the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. one way of reducing this risk is through the illegal use of inside information, and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to leveraged buyouts was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving michael milken and ivan boesky.
another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a convergence trade. in the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. in comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.
as arbitrages generally involve "future" movements of cash, they are subject to counterparty risk: if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction. this is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty, whose failure thus poses a threat, or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail. this hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences.
for example, if one purchases many risky bonds, then hedges them with cdses, profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the cds premium, in a financial crisis the bonds may default "and" the cds writer/seller may itself fail, due to the stress of the crisis, causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses.
arbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic, "leveraged" trades, as they involve a short position. if the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post margin (faces a margin call), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. in effect, arbitrage traders synthesize a put option on their ability to finance themselves.
prices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a "flight to quality"; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most.
also known as geographical arbitrage, this is the simplest form of arbitrage. in spatial arbitrage, an arbitrageur looks for price differences between geographically separate markets. for example, there may be a bond dealer in virginia offering a bond at 100-12/23 and a dealer in washington bidding 100-15/23 for the same bond. for whatever reason, the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices, but the arbitrageur does. the arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the virginia dealer and sells it to the washington dealer.
also called risk arbitrage, merger arbitrage generally consists of buying/holding the stock of a company that is the target of a takeover while shorting the stock of the acquiring company.
usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
the spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.
the bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed. the risk is that the deal "breaks" and the spread massively widens.
also called "municipal bond relative value arbitrage", "municipal arbitrage", or just "muni arb", this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches. the term "arbitrage" is also used in the context of the income tax regulations governing the investment of proceeds of municipal bonds; these regulations, aimed at the issuers or beneficiaries of tax-exempt municipal bonds, are different and, instead, attempt to remove the issuer's ability to arbitrage between the low tax-exempt rate and a taxable investment rate.
generally, managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a duration-neutral book. the relative value trades may be between different issuers, different bonds issued by the same entity, or capital structure trades referencing the same asset (in the case of revenue bonds). managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of non-economic investors (i.e., high income "buy and hold" investors seeking tax-exempt income) as well as the "crossover buying" arising from corporations' or individuals' changing income tax situations (i.e., insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher after-tax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses). there are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and 50,000 issuers, in contrast to the treasury market which has 400 issues and a single issuer.
second, managers construct leveraged portfolios of aaa- or aa-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by shorting the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds. these corporate equivalents are typically interest rate swaps referencing libor or sifma . the arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. the steeper slope of the municipal yield curve allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. the bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency. credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. however, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. the end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.
note, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.
a convertible bond is a bond that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.
a convertible bond can be thought of as a corporate bond with a stock call option attached to it.
the price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:
given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.
convertible arbitrage consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.
for instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell fixed income securities or interest rate futures (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some credit protection (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
he could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or delta hedging his exposure to the underlying shares.
a depositary receipt is a security that is offered as a "tracking stock" on another foreign market. for instance, a chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the new york stock exchange, as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. these securities, known as adrs (american depositary receipt) or gdrs (global depository receipt) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered "foreign" and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. many adr's are exchangeable into the original security (known as fungibility) and actually have the same value. in this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. other adr's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. since the adr is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the adr and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. however, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.
cross-border arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries:
example: apple is trading on nasdaq at us$108.84. the stock is also traded on the german electronic exchange, xetra. if 1 euro costs us$1.11, a cross-border trader could enter a buy order on the xetra at €98.03 per apple share and a sell order at €98.07 per share.
some brokers in germany do not offer access to the u.s. exchanges. hence if a german retail investor wants to buy apple stock, he needs to buy it on the xetra. the cross-border trader would sell the apple shares on xetra to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on nasdaq. afterwards, the cross-border trader would need to transfer the shares bought on nasdaq to the german xetra exchange, where he is obliged to deliver the stock.
in most cases, the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by high-frequency traders, taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the exchange rate. this kind of high-frequency trading benefits the public as it reduces the cost to the german investor and enables him to buy u.s. shares.
a dual-listed company (dlc) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. in integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. in practice, dlc share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. arbitrage positions in dlcs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the dlc and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two dlc stocks converge toward theoretical parity. however, since there is no identifiable date at which dlc prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. in the meantime, the price gap might widen. in these situations, arbitrageurs may receive margin calls, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. arbitrage in dlcs may be profitable, but is also very risky.
a good illustration of the risk of dlc arbitrage is the position in royal dutch shell—which had a dlc structure until 2005—by the hedge fund long-term capital management (ltcm, see also the discussion below). lowenstein (2000) describes that ltcm established an arbitrage position in royal dutch shell in the summer of 1997, when royal dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. in total, $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was long in shell and the other half was short in royal dutch (lowenstein, p. 99). in the autumn of 1998, large defaults on russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and ltcm had to unwind several positions. lowenstein reports that the premium of royal dutch had increased to about 22 percent and ltcm had to close the position and incur a loss. according to lowenstein (p. 234), ltcm lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the royal dutch shell trade.
the market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a price to earnings ratio (p/e) (such as a p/e of 10, which equates to a 10% roi). thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. e.g., berkshire hathaway and halydean corporation. private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to investment banking in general. private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an initial public offering (ipo).
regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position. for example, if a bank, operating under the basel i accord, has to hold 8% capital against default risk, but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to securitise the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. on the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.
this process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by alan greenspan in his october 1998 speech on the role of capital in optimal banking supervision and regulation.
the term "regulatory arbitrage" was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by scott v. simpson, a partner at law firm skadden, arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.
in economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. for example, an insurance company may choose to locate in bermuda due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. this can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location. in the case of many financial products, it may be unclear "where" the transaction occurs.
regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as it. the outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. this frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. the bank will have higher it costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of money creation and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.
example:
suppose the bank sells its it installations for us$40 million. with a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create us$400 million in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). the bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the it services company to cover the acquisition cost of the it installations. this can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the it installation is the bank. if the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. the it services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. this is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the it operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.
according to pbs frontline's 2012 four-part documentary, "money, power, and wall street," regulatory arbitrage, along with asymmetric bank lobbying in washington and abroad, allowed investment banks in the pre- and post-2008 period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives, swaps, and other credit-based instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients, government, and publics.
due to the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid coverage, one form of regulatory arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in “medicaid migration”, a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in medicaid instead. these programs that have similar characteristics as insurance products to the employee, but have radically different cost structures, resulting in significant expense reductions for employers.
telecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers. such services are offered in the united kingdom; the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the uk mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost. the calls are seen as free by the uk contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls.
such services were previously offered in the united states by companies such as futurephone.com. these services would operate in rural telephone exchanges, primarily in small towns in the state of iowa. in these areas, the local telephone carriers are allowed to charge a high "termination fee" to the caller's carrier in order to fund the cost of providing service to the small and sparsely populated areas that they serve. however, futurephone (as well as other similar services) ceased operations upon legal challenges from at&t and other service providers.
statistical arbitrage is an imbalance in expected nominal values. a casino has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance that it offers—referred to as the house advantage, house edge, vigorish or house vigorish.
long-term capital management (ltcm) lost 4.6 billion u.s. dollars in fixed income arbitrage in september 1998. ltcm had attempted to make money on the price difference between different bonds. for example, it would sell u.s. treasury securities and buy italian bond futures. the concept was that because italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term italian bond futures would have a higher return than u.s. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge. because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.
the downfall in this system began on august 17, 1998, when russia defaulted on its ruble debt and domestic dollar debt. because the markets were already nervous due to the 1997 asian financial crisis, investors began selling non-u.s. treasury debt and buying u.s. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment. as a result, the price on us treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell). this caused the difference between the prices of u.s. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as ltcm was expecting. eventually this caused ltcm to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. more controversially, officials of the federal reserve assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with ltcm that if ltcm actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system. thus ltcm failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed ltcm out.

acf fiorentina, commonly referred to as fiorentina , is an italian professional football club based in florence, tuscany. founded by a merger in august 1926, and refounded in august 2002 following bankruptcy, fiorentina have played at the top level of italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more serie a seasons.
fiorentina has won two italian championships, in 1955–56 and again in 1968–69, as well as six coppa italia trophies and one supercoppa italiana. on the european stage, fiorentina won the uefa cup winners' cup in 1960–61 and lost the final one year later. they finished runners-up in the 1956–57 european cup, losing against real madrid, and also came close to winning the 1989–90 uefa cup, finishing as runners-up against juventus after losing the first leg in turin and drawing in the second one in avellino.
fiorentina is one of the fourteen european teams that played the finals in all three major continental competitions: the champions league (1956–1957, the first italian team to reach the final in the top continental competition), the uefa cup winners (1960–1961 and 1961–1962) and the uefa cup (1989–1990).
since 1931, the club have played at the stadio artemio franchi, which currently has a capacity of 43,147. the stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. fiorentina are known widely by the nickname "viola", a reference to their distinctive purple colours.
associazione calcio fiorentina was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and national fascist party member luigi ridolfi, who initiated the merger of two older florentine clubs, cs firenze and pg libertas. the aim of the merger was to give florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant italian football championship sides of the time from northwest italy. also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of "calcio fiorentino", an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the medici family.
after a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, fiorentina reached the serie a in 1931. that same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named after giovanni berta, a prominent fascist, but now known as stadio artemio franchi. at the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. to be able to compete with the best teams in italy, fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the uruguayan pedro petrone, nicknamed "el artillero". despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to serie a. in 1941, they won their first coppa italia, but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of world war ii and other troubles.
in 1950, fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. the team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper giuliano sarti, sergio cervato, francesco rosella, guido gratton, giuseppe chiappella and aldo scaramucci but above all, the attacking duo of brazilian julinho and argentinian miguel montuori. this team won fiorentina's first "scudetto" (italian championship) in 1955–56, 12 points ahead of second-place milan. milan beat fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly fiorentina became the first italian team to play in a european cup final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of alfredo di stéfano's real madrid.
fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. in the 1960–61 season, the club won the coppa italia again and was also successful in europe, winning the first cup winners' cup against scottish side rangers.
after several years of runner-up finishes, fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the coppa italia and the mitropa cup in 1966.
while the 1960s did result in some trophies and good serie a finishes for fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. the 1968–69 season started with milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to bologna and were overtaken by gigi riva's cagliari. fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the serie a, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against varese, leaving cagliari as outright league leader. the second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, milan, cagliari and fiorentina. milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the european cup, and it seemed that cagliari would retain top spot. after cagliari lost against juventus, however, fiorentina took over at the top. the team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals juve in turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. in the european cup competition the following year, fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the soviet union against dynamo kyiv, but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in glasgow to celtic.
"viola" players began the 1970s decade with "scudetto" sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. after a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. the "viola" did win the anglo-italian league cup in 1974 and won the coppa italia again in 1975. the team consisted of young talents like vincenzo guerini and moreno roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all giancarlo antognoni, who would later become an idol to fiorentina's fans. the young average age of the players led to the team being called "fiorentina ye-ye".
in 1980, fiorentina was bought by flavio pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. he quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as francesco graziani and eraldo pecci from torino; daniel bertoni from sevilla; daniele massaro from monza; and a young pietro vierchowod from como. the team was built around giancarlo antognoni, and in 1982, fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals juventus. after a bad injury to antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when fiorentina were denied a goal against cagliari and were unable to win. juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.
the following years were strange for fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. fiorentina also bought two interesting players, "el puntero" ramón díaz and, most significantly, the young roberto baggio.
in 1990, fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the uefa cup final, where they again faced juventus. the turin team won the trophy, but fiorentina's "tifosi" once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in avellino (fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with many juventus fans, and emerging star roberto baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in florence's streets. the club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker mario cecchi gori.
the first season under cecchi gori's ownership was one of stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like brian laudrup, stefan effenberg, francesco baiano and, most importantly, gabriel batistuta, who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. in 1993, however, cecchi gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, vittorio. despite a good start to the season, cecchi gori fired the coach, luigi radice, after a defeat against atalanta, and replaced him with aldo agroppi. the results were dreadful: fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.
claudio ranieri was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, fiorentina dominated serie b, italy's second division. upon their return to serie a, ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer batistuta, signing the young talent rui costa from benfica and the new world champion brazilian defender márcio santos. the former became an idol to fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. the "viola" finished the season in tenth place.
the following season, cecchi gori bought other important players, namely swedish midfielder stefan schwarz. the club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the coppa italia against atalanta and finishing joint-third in serie a. in the summer, fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the supercoppa italiana, defeating milan 2–1 at the san siro.
fiorentina's 1995–96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the cup winners' cup semi-final by beating gloria bistrița, sparta prague and benfica. the team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, barcelona (away 1–1; home 0–2). the season's main signings were luís oliveira and andrei kanchelskis, the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.
at the end of the season, ranieri left fiorentina for valencia in spain, with cecchi gori appointing alberto malesani as his replacement. fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the uefa cup. malesani left fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by giovanni trapattoni. with trapattoni's expert guidance and batistuta's goals, fiorentina challenged for the title in 1998–99 but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the champions league. the following year was disappointing in serie a, but "viola" played some historical matches in the champions league, beating arsenal 1–0 at the old wembley stadium and manchester united 2–0 in florence. they were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.
at the end of the season, trapattoni left the club and was replaced by turkish coach fatih terim. more significantly, however, batistuta was sold to roma, who eventually won the title the following year. fiorentina played well in 2000–01 and stayed in the top half of serie a, despite the resignation of terim and the arrival of roberto mancini. they also won the coppa italia for the sixth and last time.
the year 2001 heralded major changes for fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around us$50 million. the club's owner, vittorio cecchi gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. fiorentina were relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season and went into judicially-controlled administration in june 2002. this form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in serie b for the 2002–03 season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.
the club was promptly re-established in august 2002 as associazione calcio fiorentina e florentia viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur diego della valle as new owner and the club was admitted into serie c2, the fourth tier of italian football. the only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was angelo di livio, whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. helped by di livio and 30-goal striker christian riganò, the club won its serie c2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to serie c1. due to the bizarre "caso catania" (catania case), however, the club skipped serie c1 and was admitted into serie b, something that was only made possible by the italian football federation (figc)'s decision to resolve the catania situation by increasing the number of teams in serie b from 20 to 24 and promoting fiorentina for "sports merits." in the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as acf fiorentina. the club finished the 2003–04 season in sixth place and won the playoff against perugia to return to top-flight football.
in their first season back in serie a, however, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against bologna and parma. in 2005, della valle decided to appoint pantaleo corvino as new sports director, followed by the appointment of cesare prandelli as head coach in the following season. the club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably luca toni and sébastien frey. this drastic move earned them a fourth-place finish with 74 points and a champions league qualifying round ticket. toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since antonio valentin angelillo in the 1958–59 season, for which he was awarded the european golden boot. on 14 july 2006, however, fiorentina were relegated to serie b due to their involvement in the 2006 serie a match fixing scandal and given a 12-point penalty. the team was reinstated to the serie a on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the 2006–07 season. the team's 2006–07 champions league place was also revoked. after the start of the season, fiorentina's penalisation was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the italian courts. in spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the uefa cup.
despite toni's departure to bayern munich, fiorentina had a strong start to the 2007–08 season and were tipped by italian national team head coach marcello lippi, among others, as a surprise challenger for the "scudetto", and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the "viola" managed to qualify for the champions league. in europe, the club reached the semi-final of the uefa cup, where they were ultimately defeated by rangers on penalties. the 2008–09 season continued this success, a fourth-place finish assuring fiorentina's spot in 2010's champions league playoffs. their european campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the 2008–09 uefa cup and were eliminated by ajax in the end.
in the 2009–10 season, fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. in europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against lyon, they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating liverpool home and away). the "viola" qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to bayern munich due to the away goals rule. this was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by tom henning øvrebø, who allowed a clearly offside goal for bayern in the first leg. bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the final. the incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. despite a good european run and reaching the semi-finals in the coppa italia, fiorentina failed to qualify for europe.
during this period, on 24 september 2009, andrea della valle resigned from his position as chairman of fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to mario cognini, fiorentina's vice-president until a permanent position could be filled.
in june 2010, the "viola" bid farewell to long-time manager cesar prandelli, by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history, who was departing to coach the italian national team. catania manager siniša mihajlović was appointed to replace him. the club spent much of the early 2010–11 season in last place, but their form improved and fiorentina ultimately finished ninth. following a 1–0 defeat to chievo in november 2011, mihajlović was sacked and replaced by delio rossi. after a brief period of improvements, the "viola" were again fighting relegation, prompting the sacking of sporting director pantaleo corvino in early 2012 following a 0–5 home defeat to juventus. their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, notably at roma and milan. during a home game against novara, trailing 0–2 within half an hour, manager rossi decided to substitute midfielder adem ljajić early. ljajić sarcastically applauded him in frustration, whereupon rossi retaliated by physical assaulting his player, an action that ultimately prompted his termination by the club. his replacement, caretaker manager vincenzo guerini, then guided the team away from the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish to end the turbulent year.
to engineer a resurrection of the club after the disappointing season, the della valle family invested heavily in the middle of 2012, buying 17 new players and appointing vincenzo montella as head coach. the team began the season well, finishing the calendar year in joint third place and eventually finishing the 2012–13 season in fourth, enough for a position in the 2013–14 europa league.
the club lost fan favourite stevan jovetić during the middle of 2013, selling him to english premier league club manchester city for a €30 million transfer fee. they also sold adem ljajić to roma and alessio cerci to torino, using the funds to bring in mario gómez, josip iličić and ante rebić, among others. during the season, fiorentina topped their europa league group, moving on to the round of 32 to face danish side esbjerg fb, which fiorentina defeated 4–2 on aggregate. in the following round of 16, however, they then lost to italian rivals juventus 2–1 on aggregate, ousting fiorentina from the competition. at the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing the year as coppa italia runners-up after losing 3–1 to napoli in the final.
in 2014–15, during the 2015 winter transfer window, the team club sold star winger juan cuadrado to chelsea for €30 million but were able to secure the loan of mohamed salah in exchange, who was a revelation in the second half of the season. their 2014–15 europa league campaign saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by spanish side sevilla, the eventual champions. in the 2014–15 domestic season, fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the 2015–16 europa league. in june 2015, vincenzo montella was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club, and was replaced by paulo sousa, who lasted until june 2017 and the appointment of stefano pioli. club captain davide astori died suddenly at the age of 31 in march 2018. the club subsequently retired astori's kit number, 13.
on 9 april 2019, pioli resigned as manager.
fiorentina have had many managers and head coaches throughout their history. below is a chronological list from the club's foundation in 1926 to the present day.
the official emblem of the city of florence, a red fleur-de-lis on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.
over the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated florence's fleur-de-lis in some way. the first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. it was soon changed to a very stylised fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. the most common symbol, adopted for about 20 years, had been a white lozenge with the flower inside. during the season they were italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the "scudetto".
the logo introduced by owner flavio pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of florence's emblem and one-half of the letter "f", for fiorentina. people disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a halberd than a fleur-de-lis.
today's logo is a kite shaped double lozenge bordered in gold. the outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters "ac" in white and the letter "f" in red, standing for the club's name. the inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of florence. this logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. florence's "comune" instead granted florentia viola use of the stylised coat of arms used in other city documents. diego della valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of €2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in italian football.
when fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem. the more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname "la viola" ("the purple (team)"). tradition has it that fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.
the away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. the shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. fiorentina's third kit was first worn in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two lilies on the shoulders. the red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the coppa italia, in 2000–01.
for the 2017–18 season and the first time in its history, the club used five kits during the season, composing of one home kit (all-purple) and four away kits, each one representing one historic quartiere of the city of florence: all-blue (santa croce), all-white (santo spirito), all-green (san giovanni) and all-red (santa maria novella).

a.c. fiorentina s.p.a. was unable to register for 2002–03 serie b due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to article 52 of n.o.i.f., while the old company was liquidated. at that time the club was heavily relying on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increased the cost by the increase in amortisation of player contracts (an intangible assets). for example, marco rossi joined fiorentina for 17 billion lire in 2000, but at the same time lorenzo collacchioni moved to salernitana for 1 billion lire, meaning the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1 billion lire to be amortised in 5-years. in 1999, emiliano bigica also swapped with giuseppe taglialatela, which the latter was valued for 10 billion lire. the operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 italian lire (minus €58,499,835). it was only boosted by the sales of francesco toldo and rui costa in june 2001 (a profit of 134.883 billion lire; €69.661 million). however, it was alleged they were to transfer to parma for a reported 140 million lire. the two players eventually joined inter milan and a.c. milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. failing to have financial support from the owner vittorio cecchi gori, the club was forced to windup due to its huge imbalance in operating income.
since re-established in 2002, acf fiorentina s.p.a. are yet to self-sustain to keep the team in top division as well as in european competitions. in the 2005 financial year, which cover the first serie a season, the club made a net loss of €9,159,356, followed by a net loss of €19,519,789. in 2006 (2005–06 serie a and 2006–07 serie a), fiorentina heavily invested on players, meaning the amortisation of intangible asset (the player contract) had increased from €17.7 million to €24 million. however the club suffered from the 2006 italian football scandal, which meant the club did not qualify for europe. in 2007 fiorentina almost broke-even, with a net loss of just €3,704,953. in the 2007 financial year the tv revenue increased after they qualified to the 2007–08 uefa cup. despite qualifying to the 2008–09 uefa champions league, fiorentina made a net loss of €9,179,484 in 2008 financial year after the increase in tv revenue was outweighed by the increase in wage. in the 2009 financial year, fiorentina made a net profit of €4,442,803, largely due to the profit on selling players (€33,631,489 from players such as felipe melo, giampaolo pazzini and zdravko kuzmanović; increased from about €3.5 million in 2008). however it was also offset by the write-down of selling players (€6,062,545, from players such as manuel da costa, arturo lupoli and davide carcuro).
after the club failed to qualify to europe at the end of 2009–10 serie a, as well as lack of player profit, fiorentina turnover was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite the wage bill also falling, "la viola" still made a net loss of €9,604,353. in the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from uefa for participating 2009–10 uefa europa league. furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. the wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. "la viola" had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to d'agostino, frey and mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to ac fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. if deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. in 2012, the club benefited from the sales of matija nastasić and valon behrami, followed by stevan jovetić and adem ljajić in 2013. in 2014, due to €28.4 million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result was still worse than in 2013. moreover, fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5 million in the first assessment period of uefa financial fair play regulations in the 2013–14 season (in may 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45 million, as well as minus €25.5 million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). however, as the limit was reduced to minus €30 million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6 million in 2015 financial year. "la viola" sold juan cuadrado to chelsea in january 2015 for €30 million fee, to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of uefa competitions.

afrobeat is a music genre which involves the combination of elements of west african musical styles such as fuji music and highlife with american funk and jazz influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion.
the term was coined in the 1960s by nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader fela kuti, who is responsible for pioneering and popularizing the style both within and outside nigeria.
distinct from afrobeat, is afrobeats - a sound originating in nigeria in the 21st century, which takes in diverse influences and is an eclectic combination of rap, reggae, dancehall, and even r&b.
afrobeat began in ghana in the early 1920s. during that time, ghanaian musicians incorporated foreign influences like the foxtrot and calypso with ghanaian rhythms like "osibisaba" (fante). highlife was associated with the local african aristocracy during the colonial period and was played by numerous bands including the jazz kings, cape coast sugar babies, and accra orchestra along the country's coast.
nigeria later joined the afrobeat wave in the late 60s led by fela kuti who experimented with different contemporary music of the time. upon arriving in nigeria, kuti also changed the name of his group to africa '70. the new sound hailed from a club that he established called the afrika shrine. the band maintained a five-year residency at the afrika shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among nigerian youth.
although the term afrobeat was coined as early as 1968, after making a trip to the united states, kuti wasn't really making music in the category of afrobeat. the name “afrobeat” shows the significance of groove to the music, as opposed to afrofunk.
in 1969, kuti and his band went on a trip to the u.s. and met sandra smith, a singer and former black panther. sandra smith (now known as sandra isadore) introduced kuti to many writings of activist such as martin luther king jr., angela davis, jesse jackson, and his biggest influence of all, malcolm x.
as kuti was interested in african american politics, smith would inform him of current events. in return, kuti would fill her in on african culture. since kuti stayed at smith's house and was spending so much time with her, he started to re-evaluate his music. that was when fela kuti noticed that he was not playing african music. from that day forward, kuti changed his sound and the message behind his music.
the name was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish fela kuti's music from the soul music of american artists such as james brown.
prevalent in his and lagbaja's music are native nigerian harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing, and improvising upon them. politics are essential to afrobeat, since founder kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. his message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the african countries in the 1970s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. as the genre spread throughout the african continent many bands took up the style. the recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on compilation albums and cds from specialist record shops.
big band (15 to 30 pieces: fela-era afrobeat) and energetic performances
fela kuti included the traditional gbedu drum in his ensemble, with a percussionist pounding out a thunderous rhythm from a drum lying on its side.
many jazz musicians have been attracted to afrobeat. from roy ayers in the 1970s to randy weston in the 1990s, there have been collaborations that have resulted in albums such as "africa: centre of the world" by roy ayers, released on the polydore label in 1981. in 1994 branford marsalis, the american jazz saxophonist, included samples of fela's "beast of no nation" on his "buckshot lefonque" album. the new generation of djs and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and remixes of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of afropop and groove (see afrobeats section below).
afrobeat has also profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like brian eno and david byrne, who credit fela kuti as an essential influence. both worked on talking heads' highly acclaimed 1980 album "remain in light", which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to western music.
the horn section of antibalas have been guest musicians on tv on the radio's highly acclaimed 2008 album "dear science", as well as on british band foals' 2008 album, "antidotes". some afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of vampire weekend and paul simon.
in 2009 the music label knitting factory records (kfr) produced the broadway musical "fela!" as said on the musical's website, the story showcased fela kuti's “courage and incredible musical mastery” along with the story of his life. the show had 11 tony nominations, receiving three for best costumes, best sound and best choreography. "fela!" was on broadway for fifteen months and was produced by notables such as shawn “jay-z” carter and will & jada pinkett-smith. many celebrities were noted on attending the shows such as, denzel washington, madonna, sting, spike lee (who saw it eight times), kofi annan, and even michelle obama. michelle williams, former singer of girl group destiny's child, was cast as the role of sandra isadore.
from early in the 21st century, a new type of sound, originating in nigeria, has become increasingly prominent in african popular music.this name echoes afrobeat, the 1970s fusion of jazz and traditional nigerian and ghanaian music which is an important influence, but afrobeats is a largely different style.
"afrobeats is not a style, per se, like afrobeat. it simply means the new sound of africa, which takes in diverse influences that take inspiration from its african roots and is combined with the sounds of rap, reggae/dancehall, and even r&b. it's an extremely eclectic combination that makes for quite the enjoyable sound."
afrobeats is most identifiable by its signature driving drum beat rhythms, whether electronic or instrumental. these beats harken to the stylings of a variety of traditional african drumbeats across west africa as well as the precursory genre of afrobeat. the beat in afrobeats music is not just a base for the melody, but acts as a major character of the song, taking a lead role that is sometimes equal to are of greater importance than the lyrics and almost always more central than the other instrumentals. another distinction within afrobeats is the notably west african, specifically nigerian or ghanaian, accented english that is often blended with local slangs, pidgin english, as well as local nigerian or ghanaian languages depending on the backgrounds of the performers.
djs and producers like dj black, elom adablah, and c-real (cyril-alex gockel) for example, have been a crucial part in spreading the popularity of this form of music. their artistic mixing of beats and sounds allow a younger audience to experience a sound that is somewhat familiar in its influences and yet uniquely african. their mixing and promotion of popular hits on the continent is also a tried and true method for success. often what the play in clubs, radio shows, podcasts, etc. are what become popularized both within africa and abroad.
since 2012, afrobeats have gained mainstream recognition outside of africa, especially within the uk. uk hits have included "oliver twist" by d'banj a nigerian which reached 9 on the uk singles chart in 2012, and "million pound girl (badder than bad)" by the ghanaian british artist fuse odg, which reached 5 on the uk singles chart in 2014. afrobeats nightclubs are now primary features of uk's nightlife with clubs opening in most major cities.
other mainstream popularity garnered by afrobeat is shown in canadian artist drake's music. drake's 2017 album "more life" contains many afrobeat and dancehall influences.
afrobeats has captured the attention of many award shows as well. for example, the bet awards usually highlights the musical genre of afrobeats and/or other types of music by having the category “the best international act.” in the year 2018, the famous nigerian afrobeats singer davido won and when presented the award, the audience knew he was from nigeria. when accepting his awards, davido says, “my continent has been so blessed to influence other cultures. let's collaborate everybody.” in this statement, davido tried to show the audience of american celebrities that african artists would love to collab and make their mark in america. in previous years other famous artists have won the category as well, such as the singer wizkid (nigeria) in 2017 and in 2016 the dj black coffee (south africa) won.
according to david drake, the eclectic genre "reimagines diasporic influences and—more often than not—completely reinvents them." however, some caution against equating afrobeats to contemporary pan-african music, in order to prevent the erasure of local musical contributions.
afrobeats is primarily produced between lagos, accra, and london. paul gilroy, of "the black atlantic", reflects on the changing london music scene as a result of shifting demographics:"we are moving towards an african majority which is diverse both in its cultural habits and in its relationship to colonial and postcolonial governance, so the shift away from caribbean dominance needs to be placed in that setting. most of the grime folks are african kids, either the children of migrants or migrants themselves. it's not clear what africa might mean to them"many first and second generation african immigrants follow - and produce - afrobeats music. fuse odg, a uk artist of ghanaian descent, coins #tina or this is new africa as a means to change perceptions of africa:"this movement will shed light on africa in a positive way and focus on how we can improve africa. it's not about just plying your talents in the western world; it's about going back home and helping africa."
although originally a nigerian genre afrobeats has grown in popularity worldwide. it first made its global debut in the united kingdom with the surge of african immigrants, however the tunes of this genre can now be heard everywhere. iyanya, wizkid, sean tizzle, d’banj, p-square,tiwa savage and davido serve as prime examples of nigerian artists who have emerged in the global scale. afrobeats’ international popularity is likely rooted in the fact that beat/melody resemble a blend of edm, r&b, and hip-hop thus providing a familiar tune for many. furthermore, as english is an official language of nigeria, artists often choose to sing/rap in english, pidgin english, and/or their local language. afrobeats have expanded global conversation of nigeria, which had previously been reduced to political unrest as a result of religious disputes. afrobeats in a sense has created a platform for which the world can engage with nigeria's vibrant and rich culture.
american artist including michelle williams have used afrobeats directly in their music or have been heavily influenced by afro beat songs. this includes william's top hit “say yes,” a gospel song based on the nigerian hymn “when jesus say yes.” the song's beats are said to resemble the popular four-beat of house music, but in fact follows the 3-2 or 2-3 of afrobeats. this beat is known as the clave and mixes a rhythm with a normal 4/4 beat, it is commonly seen in many forms west african music. furthermore, there have been many collaborations between performers in the west and nigerian artists including french montana and ice prince, rick ross and p-square, and kanye and d’banj.
while afrobeats international popularity has considerably grown its primary audience continues to be africans, especially the diasporic communities that have come as a result of education. many nigerian artists tour the u.k and the united states to large immigrant audiences. dj 3k, a nigerian-american immigrant, and his brother dee money have developed a large network in chicago, and usually bring nigerian artists to the city. they have used this as a platform to bring these performers across the united states.
the variability in this genre allows for the production of a variety of songs, each one more exciting than the next. regardless, it consistently relies on a set of heavy beats that make this music easy to dance to, which acts as a major draw for the genre. furthermore, many major artists of afrobeats have opted to sing in a manner that resemble those of american rap and hip hop. furthermore, theses melodies are often occupied by opulent music videos filled with picturesque mansions, expensive cars, and other tropes familiar to american music videos. other nigerian artists have found inspiration in south africa, mixing afro-house, popular in south africa, with afrobeats. artist like patoranking have looked to the caribbean for inspiration, particularly jamaican dancehall.
notable musicians whose music have been classified as afrobeats:
a music festival that's recognized worldwide is "one africa music fest". the festival has four different locations: new york city, houston, london, and dubai. "one africa music fest" showcases modern afrobeat music and talent.
as stated on the official website, the main focus of the music festival is to help strengthen africa's position in the entertainment industry on a global level. the festival also wants to create awareness to display the positive side of africa that people don't usually know about. this afrobeats music festival promotes collaboration between other artists, businesses and communities.
afro beat fest is an annual festival in newark, new jersey celebrating african culture including music, art, fashion, dance, crafts and cuisine.

in number theory, an arithmetic, arithmetical, or number-theoretic function is for most authors any function "f"("n") whose domain is the positive integers and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers. hardy & wright include in their definition the requirement that an arithmetical function "expresses some arithmetical property of "n"".
an example of an arithmetic function is the divisor function whose value at a positive integer "n" is equal to the number of divisors of "n".
there is a larger class of number-theoretic functions that do not fit the above definition, e.g. the prime-counting functions. this article provides links to functions of both classes.
many of the functions mentioned in this article have expansions as series involving these sums; see the article ramanujan's sum for examples.
an arithmetic function "a" is
two whole numbers "m" and "n" are called coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1; i.e., if there is no prime number that divides both of them.
then an arithmetic function "a" is
formula_1   and   formula_2   mean that the sum or product is over all prime numbers:
similarly,   formula_5   and   formula_6   mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers with strictly positive exponent (so 1 is not included):
formula_8   and   formula_9   mean that the sum or product is over all positive divisors of "n", including 1 and "n". e.g., if "n" = 12,
the notations can be combined:   formula_11   and   formula_12   mean that the sum or product is over all prime divisors of "n". e.g., if "n" = 18,
and similarly   formula_14   and   formula_15   mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers dividing "n". e.g., if "n" = 24,
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer "n" can be represented uniquely as a product of powers of primes:   formula_17   where "p" < "p" < ... < "p" are primes and the "a" are positive integers. (1 is given by the empty product.)
it is often convenient to write this as an infinite product over all the primes, where all but a finite number have a zero exponent. define the "p"-adic valuation ν("n") to be the exponent of the highest power of the prime "p" that divides "n". that is, if "p" is one of the "p" then ν("n") = "a", otherwise it is zero. then
in terms of the above the prime omega functions ω and ω are defined by
to avoid repetition, whenever possible formulas for the functions listed in this article are given in terms of "n" and the corresponding "p", "a", ω, and ω.
σ("n") is the sum of the "k"th powers of the positive divisors of "n", including 1 and "n", where "k" is a complex number.
σ("n"), the sum of the (positive) divisors of "n", is usually denoted by σ("n").
since a positive number to the zero power is one, σ("n") is therefore the number of (positive) divisors of "n"; it is usually denoted by "d"("n") or τ("n") (for the german "teiler" = divisors).
setting "k" = 0 in the second product gives
φ("n"), the euler totient function, is the number of positive integers not greater than "n" that are coprime to "n".
j("n"), the jordan totient function, is the number of "k"-tuples of positive integers all less than or equal to "n" that form a coprime ("k" + 1)-tuple together with "n". it is a generalization of euler's totient, .
μ("n"), the möbius function, is important because of the möbius inversion formula. see dirichlet convolution, below.
this implies that μ(1) = 1. (because ω(1) = ω(1) = 0.)
τ("n"), the ramanujan tau function, is defined by its generating function identity:
although it is hard to say exactly what "arithmetical property of "n"" it "expresses", (τ("n") is (2π) times the "n"th fourier coefficient in the q-expansion of the modular discriminant function) it is included among the arithmetical functions because it is multiplicative and it occurs in identities involving certain σ("n") and "r"("n") functions (because these are also coefficients in the expansion of modular forms).
"c"("n"), ramanujan's sum, is the sum of the "n"th powers of the primitive "q"th roots of unity:
even though it is defined as a sum of complex numbers (irrational for most values of "q"), it is an integer. for a fixed value of "n" it is multiplicative in "q":
see dedekind psi function.
λ("n"), the liouville function, is defined by
all dirichlet characters χ("n") are completely multiplicative. an example is the non-principal character (mod 4) defined in the introduction. two characters have special notations:
the principal character (mod "n") is denoted by χ("a") (or χ("a")). it is defined as
the quadratic character (mod "n") is denoted by the jacobi symbol for odd "n" (it is not defined for even "n".):
in this formula formula_30 is the legendre symbol, defined for all integers "a" and all odd primes "p" by
following the normal convention for the empty product, formula_32
ω("n"), defined above as the number of distinct primes dividing "n", is additive (see prime omega function).
ω("n"), defined above as the number of prime factors of "n" counted with multiplicities, is completely additive (see prime omega function).
for a fixed prime "p", ν("n"), defined above as the exponent of the largest power of "p" dividing "n", is completely additive.
these important functions (which are not arithmetic functions) are defined for non-negative real arguments, and are used in the various statements and proofs of the prime number theorem. they are summation functions (see the main section just below) of arithmetic functions which are neither multiplicative nor additive.
π("x"), the prime counting function, is the number of primes not exceeding "x". it is the summation function of the characteristic function of the prime numbers.
a related function counts prime powers with weight 1 for primes, 1/2 for their squares, 1/3 for cubes, … it is the summation function of the arithmetic function which takes the value 1/"k" on integers which are the k-th power of some prime number, and the value 0 on other integers.
"θ"("x") and "ψ"("x"), the chebyshev functions,
are defined as sums of the natural logarithms of the primes not exceeding "x".
the chebyshev function "ψ"("x") is the summation function of the von mangoldt function just below.
λ("n"), the von mangoldt function, is 0 unless the argument "n" is a prime power , in which case it is the natural log of the prime "p":
"p"("n"), the partition function, is the number of ways of representing "n" as a sum of positive integers, where two representations with the same summands in a different order are not counted as being different:
λ("n"), the carmichael function, is the smallest positive number such that formula_39   for all "a" coprime to "n". equivalently, it is the least common multiple of the orders of the elements of the multiplicative group of integers modulo "n".
for powers of odd primes and for 2 and 4, λ("n") is equal to the euler totient function of "n"; for powers of 2 greater than 4 it is equal to one half of the euler totient function of "n":
and for general "n" it is the least common multiple of λ of each of the prime power factors of "n":
"h"("n"), the class number function, is the order of the ideal class group of an algebraic extension of the rationals with discriminant "n". the notation is ambiguous, as there are in general many extensions with the same discriminant. see quadratic field and cyclotomic field for classical examples.
"r"("n") is the number of ways "n" can be represented as the sum of "k" squares, where representations that differ only in the order of the summands or in the signs of the square roots are counted as different.
given an arithmetic function "a(n)", its summation function "a(x)" is defined by
"a" can be regarded as a function of a real variable. given a positive integer "m", "a" is constant along open intervals "m" < "x" < "m" + 1, and has a jump discontinuity at each integer for which "a(m)" ≠ 0.
since such functions are often represented by series and integrals, to achieve pointwise convergence it is usual to define the value at the discontinuities as the average of the values to the left and right:
individual values of arithmetic functions may fluctuate wildly – as in most of the above examples. summation functions "smooth out" these fluctuations. in some cases it may be possible to find asymptotic behaviour for the summation function for large "x".
a classical example of this phenomenon is given by the divisor summatory function, the summation function of "d"("n"), the number of divisors of "n":
an average order of an arithmetic function is some simpler or better-understood function which has the same summation function asymptotically, and hence takes the same values "on average". we say that "g" is an "average order" of "f" if
as "x" tends to infinity. the example above shows that "d"("n") has the average order log("n").
given an arithmetic function "a(n)", let "f(s)", for complex "s", be the function defined by the corresponding dirichlet series (where it converges):
"f(s)" is called a generating function of "a(n)". the simplest such series, corresponding to the constant function "a"("n") = 1 for all "n", is ς("s") the riemann zeta function.
the generating function of the möbius function is the inverse of the zeta function:
consider two arithmetic functions "a" and "b" and their respective generating functions "f"("s") and "f"("s"). the product "f"("s")"f"("s") can be computed as follows:
it is a straightforward exercise to show that if "c"("n") is defined by
then
this function "c" is called the dirichlet convolution of "a" and "b", and is denoted by formula_54.
a particularly important case is convolution with the constant function "a"("n") = 1 for all "n", corresponding to multiplying the generating function by the zeta function:
multiplying by the inverse of the zeta function gives the möbius inversion formula:
if "f" is multiplicative, then so is "g". if "f" is completely multiplicative, then "g" is multiplicative, but may or may not be completely multiplicative.
there are a great many formulas connecting arithmetical functions with each other and with the functions of analysis, especially powers, roots, and the exponential and log functions. the page divisor sum identities contains many more generalized and related examples of identities involving arithmetic functions.
here are a few examples:
there is a formula for r in the section on class numbers below.
define the function σ("n") as
that is, if "n" is odd, σ("n") is the sum of the "k"th powers of the divisors of "n", i.e. σ("n"), and if "n" is even it is the sum of the "k"th powers of the even divisors of "n" minus the sum of the "k"th powers of the odd divisors of "n".
adopt the convention that ramanujan's τ("x") = 0 if "x" is not an integer.
here "convolution" does not mean "dirichlet convolution" but instead refers to the formula for the coefficients of the product of two power series:
the sequence formula_82 is called the convolution or the cauchy product of the sequences "a" and "b".
<br>see eisenstein series for a discussion of the series and functional identities involved in these formulas.
since σ("n") (for natural number "k") and τ("n") are integers, the above formulas can be used to prove congruences for the functions. see ramanujan tau function for some examples.
extend the domain of the partition function by setting "p"(0) = 1.
peter gustav lejeune dirichlet discovered formulas that relate the class number "h" of quadratic number fields to the jacobi symbol.
an integer "d" is called a fundamental discriminant if it is the discriminant of a quadratic number field. this is equivalent to "d" ≠ 1 and either a) "d" is squarefree and "d" ≡ 1 (mod 4) or b) "d" ≡ 0 (mod 4), "d"/4 is squarefree, and "d"/4 ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).
extend the jacobi symbol to accept even numbers in the "denominator" by defining the kronecker symbol:
then if "d" < −4 is a fundamental discriminant
h(d) & = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{r=1}^r\left(\frac{d}{r}\right)\\

ansi c, iso c and standard c refer to the successive standards for the c programming language published by the american national standards institute (ansi) and the international organization for standardization (iso). historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known as c89 or c90). software developers writing in c are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers.
the first standard for c was published by ansi. although this document was subsequently adopted by international organization for standardization (iso) and subsequent revisions published by iso have been adopted by ansi, "ansi c" is still used to refer to the standard. while some software developers use the term iso c, others are standards-body neutral and use standard c.
in 1983, the american national standards institute formed a committee, x3j11, to establish a standard specification of c. the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ansi x3.159-1989 "programming language c." this version of the language is often referred to as "ansi c". later on sometimes the label "c89" is used to distinguish it from c99 but using the same labelling method.
the same standard as c89 was ratified by the international organization for standardization as iso/iec 9899:1990, with only formatting changes, which is sometimes referred to as c90. therefore, the terms "c89" and "c90" refer to essentially the same language.
this standard has been withdrawn by both ansi/incits and iso/iec.
in 1995, the iso published an extension, called amendment 1, for the ansi-c standard. its full name finally was "iso/iec 9899:1990/amd1:1995" or nicknamed "c95". aside from error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities, such as:
in addition to the amendment, two technical corrigenda were published by iso for c90:
in march 2000, ansi adopted the iso/iec 9899:1999 standard. this standard is commonly referred to as c99. some notable additions to the previous standard include:
three technical corrigenda were published by iso for c99:
this standard has been withdrawn by both ansi/incits and iso/iec in favour of c11.
, "c11" is the previous standard for the c programming language. notable features introduced over the previous revision include improved unicode support, type-generic expressions using the new codice_17 keyword, a cross-platform multi-threading api (codice_18) and atomic types support in both core language and the library (codice_19).
one technical corrigendum has been published by iso for c11:
, "c18" is the current standard for the c programming language.
as part of the standardization process, iso also publishes technical reports and specifications related to the c language:
more technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including the fifth and final part of ts 18661, a software transactional memory specification, and parallel library extensions.
ansi c is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. gcc and clang are two major c compilers popular today, both are based on the c11 with updates including changes from later specifications such as c17 and c18. any program written "only" in standard c and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any platform with a conforming c implementation. without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as gui libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte endianness.
to mitigate the differences between k&r c and the ansi c standard, the codice_20 ("standard c") macro can be used to split code into ansi and k&r sections.
in the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ansi compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. those are still ansi-compliant as of c99. note how this code checks both definition and evaluation: this is because some implementations may set codice_20 to zero to indicate non-ansi compliance.

the alien and sedition acts were four laws passed by the federalist-dominated 5th united states congress and signed into law by president john adams in 1798. they made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen (naturalization act), allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens who were deemed dangerous (alien friends act of 1798) or who were from a hostile nation (alien enemy act of 1798), and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government (sedition act of 1798).
the federalists argued that the bills strengthened national security during the quasi-war, an undeclared naval war with france from 1798 to 1800. critics argued that they were primarily an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the federalist party and its teachings, and violated the right of freedom of speech in the first amendment.
the naturalization act increased the residency requirement for american citizenship from five to fourteen years. at the time, the majority of immigrants supported thomas jefferson and the democratic-republicans, the political opponents of the federalists. the alien friends act allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered "dangerous to the peace and safety of the united states" at any time, while the alien enemies act authorized the president to do the same to any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of fourteen during times of war. lastly, the controversial sedition act restricted speech that was critical of the federal government. under the sedition act, the federalists allowed people who were accused of violating the sedition laws to use truth as a defense. the sedition act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government.
the acts were denounced by democratic-republicans and ultimately helped them to victory in the 1800 election, when thomas jefferson defeated the incumbent, president adams. the sedition act and the alien friends act were allowed to expire in 1800 and 1801, respectively. the alien enemies act, however, remains in effect as chapter 3; sections 21–24 of title 50 of the united states code. it was used by the government to identify and imprison dangerous enemy aliens from germany, japan, and italy in world war ii. (this was separate from the japanese internment camps used to remove people of japanese descent from the west coast.) after the war they were deported to their home countries. in 1948 the supreme court determined that presidential powers under the acts continued after cessation of hostilities until there was a peace treaty with the hostile nation. the revised alien enemies act remains in effect today.
opposition to the federalists, spurred by democratic-republicans, reached new heights with the democratic-republicans' support of france, which was still in the midst of the french revolution. some appeared to desire in the united states an event similar to the french revolution, in order to overthrow the government. when democratic-republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws such as the 1791 whiskey tax, the first tax levied by the national government, and threatened to rebel, federalists warned that they would send in the army to force them to capitulate. as the unrest sweeping europe spread to the united states, calls for secession reached unparalleled heights, and the fledgling nation seemed ready to tear itself apart. some of this agitation was seen by federalists as having been caused by french and french-sympathizing immigrants. the alien act and the sedition act were meant to guard against this perceived threat of anarchy.
they were a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800, controversial then, and remaining so today. opposition to them resulted in the highly controversial virginia and kentucky resolutions, authored by james madison and thomas jefferson. prominent prosecutions under the sedition act include:
the democratic-republicans made the alien and sedition acts an important issue in the 1800 election campaign. upon assuming the presidency, thomas jefferson pardoned those still serving sentences under the sedition act, and congress soon repaid their fines. it has been said that the alien acts were aimed at albert gallatin, and the sedition act aimed at benjamin bache's "aurora". while government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation, many aliens fled the country during the debate over the alien and sedition acts, and adams never signed a deportation order.
the alien and sedition acts were never appealed to the supreme court, whose right of judicial review was not clearly established until "marbury v. madison" in 1803. subsequent mentions in supreme court opinions beginning in the mid-20th century have assumed that the sedition act would today be found unconstitutional.
thomas jefferson and james madison also secretly drafted the kentucky and virginia resolutions denouncing the federal legislation, though many other state legislatures strongly opposed these resolutions. though the resolutions followed madison's "interposition" approach, jefferson advocated nullification and at one point drafted a threat for kentucky to secede. jefferson's biographer dumas malone argued that this might have gotten jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. in writing the kentucky resolutions, jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold", the alien and sedition acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood". historian ron chernow says of this "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president." jefferson "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution." chernow argues that neither jefferson nor madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the alien and sedition acts themselves. historian garry wills argued, "their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure" the theoretical damage of the kentucky and virginia resolutions was "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion". george washington was so appalled by them that he told patrick henry that if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would "dissolve the union or produce coercion". the influence of jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the civil war and beyond. at the close of the civil war, future president james garfield said that jefferson's kentucky resolution "contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits".
the alien enemies acts remained in effect at the outset of world war i. it was recodified to be part of the us war and national defense statutes (50 usc 21–24).
on december 7, 1941, responding to the bombing of pearl harbor, president franklin delano roosevelt used the authority of the revised alien enemies act to issue presidential proclamations 2525 (alien enemies – japanese), 2526 (alien enemies – german), and 2527 (alien enemies – italian), to apprehend, restrain, secure and remove japanese, german, and italian non-citizens. on february 19, 1942, citing authority of the wartime powers of the president and commander in chief, roosevelt made executive order 9066, authorizing the secretary of war to prescribe military areas and giving him authority that superseded the authority of other executives under proclamations 2525-7. eo 9066 led to the internment of japanese americans, whereby over 110,000 people of japanese ancestry living on the pacific coast were forcibly relocated and forced to live in camps in the interior of the country, 62% of whom were united states citizens, not aliens.
hostilities with germany and italy ended in may 1945, and with japan in august. alien enemies, and u.s. citizens, continued to be interned. on july 14, 1945, president harry s. truman issued presidential proclamation 2655, titled "removal of alien enemies". the proclamation gave the attorney general authority regarding aliens enemies within the continental united states, to decide whether they are "dangerous to the public peace and safety of the united states", to order them removed, and to create regulations governing their removal. the proclamation cited the revised alien enemies act (50 u.s.c. 21–24) as to powers of the president to make public proclamation regarding "subjects of the hostile nation" more than fourteen years old and living inside the united states but not naturalized, to remove them as alien enemies, and to determine the means of removal.
on september 8, 1945, truman issued presidential proclamation 2662, titled "removal of alien enemies". the revised alien enemies act (50 u.s.c. 21–24) was cited as to removal of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety. the united states had agreed, at a conference in rio de janeiro in 1942, to assume responsibility for the restraint and repatriation of dangerous alien enemies to be sent to the united states from latin american republics. in another inter-american conference in mexico city on march 8, 1945, north and south american governments resolved to recommended adoption of measures to prevent aliens of hostile nations who were deemed to be security threats or threats to welfare from remaining in north or south america. truman gave authority to the secretary of state to determine if alien enemies in the united states who were sent to the united states from latin america, or who were in the united states illegally, endangered the welfare or security of the country. the secretary of state was given power to remove them "to destinations outside the limits of the western hemisphere", to the former enemy territory of the governments to whose "principles of which (the alien enemies) have adhered". the department of justice was directed to assist the secretary of state in their prompt removal.
on april 10, 1946, truman issued presidential proclamation 2685, titled "removal of alien enemies", citing the revised alien enemies act (50 u.s.c. 21–24) as to its provision for the "removal from the united states of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety". truman proclaimed regulations that were in addition to and supplemented other "regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies". as to alien enemies who had been brought into the continental united states from latin america after december 1941, the proclamation gave the secretary of state authority to decide if their presence was "prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the americas", and to make regulations for their removal. 30 days was set as the reasonable time for them to "effect the recovery, disposal, and removal of (their) goods and effects, and for (their) departure".
in 1947 new york's ellis island continued to incarcerate hundreds of ethnic germans. fort lincoln was a large internment camp still holding internees in north dakota. north dakota was represented by controversial senator william "wild bill" langer. langer introduced a bill (s. 1749) "for the relief of all persons detained as enemy aliens", and directing the us attorney general to cancel "outstanding warrants of arrest, removal, or deportation" for many german aliens still interned, listing many by name, and all of those detained by the immigration and naturalization service (ins), which was under the department of justice (doj). it directed the ins not to issue any more warrants or orders, if their only basis was the original warrants of arrest. the bill never passed. the attorney general gave up plenary jurisdiction over the last internee on ellis island late in 1948.
in ludecke v. watkins (1948), the supreme court interpreted the time of release under the alien enemies act. german alien kurt g. w. ludecke was detained in 1941, under proclamation 2526. and continued to be held after cessation of hostilities. in 1947, ludecke petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to order his release, after the attorney general ordered him deported. the court ruled 5–4 to release ludecke, but also found that the alien enemies act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased, until an actual treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government.
in 1988, president reagan and the 100th congress introduced the civil liberties act of 1988, whose purpose amongst others was to acknowledge and apologize for actions of the us against individuals of japanese ancestry during world war ii. the statement from congress agreed with the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians, that "a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of japanese ... without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership".
in 2015, presidential candidate donald trump made a proposal to ban foreign muslims from entering the united states (as part of the war on terror); roosevelt's application of the alien enemies act was cited as a possible justification. the proposal created international controversy, drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in united states presidential elections. a former reagan administration aide noted that, despite criticism of trump's proposal to invoke the law, "the alien enemies act ... is still on the books ... (and people) in congress for many decades (haven't) repealed the law ... (nor has) barack obama". other critics claimed that the proposal violated founding principles, and was unconstitutional for singling out a religion, and not a hostile nation. they included the pentagon and others, who argued that the proposal (and its citation of the alien enemies proclamations as authority) played into the isil narrative that the united states was at war with the entire muslim religion (not just with isil and other terrorist entities). on june 26, 2018, in the 5–4 decision "trump v. hawaii", the u.s. supreme court upheld presidential proclamation 9645, the third version of president trump's travel ban, with the majority opinion being written by chief justice john roberts.

antinomy (greek ἀντί, "antí", "against, in opposition to", and νόμος, "nómos", "law") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws. it is a term used in logic and epistemology, particularly in the philosophy of kant.
there are many examples of antinomy. a self-contradictory phrase such as "there is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. a paradox such as "this sentence is false" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.
the term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of immanuel kant (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or experience (phenomena). empirical reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which transcends it.
for kant there are four antinomies, connected with:
in each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. for example: in the first antinomy, kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. this is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by "successive synthesis"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been "empty time" out of which time arose. this is incoherent (for kant) for the following reason: since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.
this was part of kant's critical program of determining limits to science and philosophical inquiry. these contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between phenomena and noumena). kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.
kant is not the only philosopher to employ the term, however. another famous use of antinomy is by karl marx, in "capital" volume one, in the chapter entitled "the working day". on marx's account, capitalist production sustains "the assertion of a right to an unlimited working day, and the assertion of a right to a limited working day, both with equal justification". furner emphasizes that the thesis and antithesis of this antinomy are not contradictory opposites, but rather "consist in the assertion of rights to states of affairs that are contradictory opposites".

in mathematics, the ascending chain condition (acc) and descending chain condition (dcc) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly ideals in certain commutative rings. these conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of david hilbert, emmy noether, and emil artin.
the conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any partially ordered set. this point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to gabriel and rentschler.
a partially ordered set (poset) "p" is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition (acc) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements eventually terminates. equivalently, given any weakly ascending sequence
there exists a positive integer "n" such that
similarly, "p" is said to satisfy the descending chain condition (dcc) if every strictly descending sequence of elements of "p" eventually terminates, that is, there is no infinite descending chain. equivalently, every weakly descending sequence
of elements of "p" eventually stabilizes.

rabbi adin steinsaltz () or adin even yisrael () (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic, and spiritual mentor, who has been hailed by "time" magazine as a "once-in-a-millennium scholar". he has devoted his life to making the talmud accessible to all jews. originally published in modern hebrew, with a running commentary to facilitate learning, his "steinsaltz edition of the talmud" has also been translated into english, french, russian, and spanish. beginning in 1989, steinsaltz published several tractates in hebrew and english of the babylonian (bavli) talmud in an english-hebrew edition. the first volume of a new english-hebrew edition, the koren talmud bavli, was released in may, 2012, with thirteen tractates in print by july 2014. new volumes are being released following the daf yomi cycle.
born in jerusalem in 1937 to secular parents, steinsaltz studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the hebrew university, in addition to rabbinical studies. following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-hassidic community in the negev desert, and, at the age of 23, became israel's youngest school principal.
in 1965, he founded the israel institute for talmudic publications, and began his monumental work on the talmud, including translation into hebrew, english, russian, and various other languages. the steinsaltz editions of the talmud include translation from the original aramaic and a comprehensive commentary. steinsaltz completed his hebrew edition of the entire babylonian talmud in november 2010, at which time koren publishers jerusalem became the publisher of all of his works, including the talmud. while not without criticism (such as by jacob neusner, 1998), the steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout israel, the united states, and the world. over two million volumes of the steinsaltz talmud have been distributed to date. controversial talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in english translations like the soncino talmud, receive full exposition in the steinsaltz talmud. random house halted publication of the steinsaltz talmud after less than one-third of the english translation had been published.
the steinsaltz editions of the talmud have opened up the world of talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught talmud. regarding the access that his work provides, rabbi steinsaltz says: "i never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings."
rabbi steinsaltz's classic work of kabbalah, "the thirteen petalled rose", was first published in 1980, and now appears in eight languages. in all, steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including talmud, jewish mysticism, jewish philosophy, sociology, historical biography, and philosophy. many of these works have been translated into english by his close personal friend, now deceased, yehuda hanegbi. his latest book is a memoir-biography on the lubavitcher rebbe, rabbi menachem mendel schneerson, published by maggid books (2014).
continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in israel and the former soviet union. he has served as scholar in residence at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars in washington, d. c., and the institute for advanced study in princeton. his honorary degrees include doctorates from yeshiva university, ben gurion university of the negev, bar ilan university, brandeis university, and florida international university. steinsaltz is also rosh yeshiva of yeshivat hesder tekoa.
being a follower of rabbi menachem mendel schneerson of chabad-lubavitch, he went to help jews in the soviet union assisting chabad's "shluchim" (propagators) network. deeply involved in the future of the jews in the former soviet union, steinsaltz serves as the region's "duchovny ravin" (spiritual rabbi), a historic russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of russian jewry. in this capacity, steinsaltz travelled to russia and the republics once each month from his home in jerusalem. during his time in the former soviet union, he founded the jewish university, both in moscow and saint petersburg. the jewish university is the first degree-granting institution of jewish studies in the former soviet union.
steinsaltz has taken a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. during a visit of a delegation of roman catholic cardinals in manhattan in january 2004, he said that, "you do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting, as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough; however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable. it's part of a process in which we can talk to each other in a friendly way", and called for "a theological dialogue that asks the tough questions, such as whether catholicism allows for jews to enter eternal paradise".
steinsaltz and his wife live in jerusalem, and have three children and more than ten grandchildren. his son, rabbi menachem ("meni") even-israel, is the executive director of the steinsaltz center, rabbi steinsaltz's umbrella organization, located in the nachlaot neighborhood of jerusalem.
rabbi steinsaltz accepted the position as nasi (president) of the 2004 attempt to revive the sanhedrin. in 2008, he resigned from this position due to differences of opinion.
rabbi steinsaltz is a prolific author and commentator, having written numerous books on jewish knowledge, tradition and culture, and produced original commentaries on the entirety of jewish canon: tanakh (torah, prophets, and writings), the babylonian talmud, the mishna, the mishneh torah, and tanya.
his published works include:
steinsaltz is a popular university and radio commentator. he was invited to speak at the aspen institute for humanistic studies at yale university in 1979.
prior to his stroke, he gave evening seminars in jerusalem, which, according to newsweek, usually lasted until 2:00 in the morning, and attracted prominent politicians, such as the former prime minister levi eshkol and former finance minister pinhas sapir.
rabbi steinsaltz has been honored with numerous awards throughout his lifetime to highlight his dedication to the dissemination of jewish knowledge. on april 21, 1988, he received the israel prize for jewish studies, the first of these awards.
years later, on february 9, 2012, steinsaltz was honored by israeli president shimon peres with israel's first president's prize alongside zubin mehta, uri slonim, henry kissinger, judy feld carr, and the rashi foundation.[15] steinsaltz was presented with this award for his contribution to the study of talmud, making it more accessible to jews worldwide.
steinsaltz was also presented with the 2012 national jewish book award in the category of modern jewish thought & experience by the jewish book council for his commentary, translation, and notes in the koren babylonian talmud. the modern jewish thought & experience award was awarded on january 15, 2013 in memory of joy ungerleider mayerson by the dorot foundation.
on may 22, 2017, jerusalem mayor nir barkat visited steinsaltz at his home to present him with the yakir yerushalayim (“worthy citizen of jerusalem”) medal. this medal of achievement was awarded to steinsaltz to honor his hard work in writing and translating books to be studied by millions of jews and non-jews around the world.
on june 10, 2018, steinsaltz was honored at a gala dinner at the orient hotel in jerusalem as a public marking of his unparalleled pedagogical achievements throughout a lifetime dedicated to jewish education. a limited-edition version of “the steinsaltz humash” was presented to the attendees of this event.
jacob neusner's "how adin steinsaltz misrepresents the talmud. four false propositions from his "reference guide"" (1998) displays strong disagreement.
steinsaltz's works aroused fierce opposition in parts of the orthodox jewish world, with many leading rabbis such as elazar shach, yosef shalom eliashiv, and eliezer waldenberg harshly condemning his talmud and other books. waldenberg wrote that when the steinsaltz talmud was brought before him, he was "shocked" to see the way in which the steinsaltz talmud described the patriarchs and talmudic sages, as well as its approach to the oral torah. waldenberg further wrote that the steinsaltz talmud had the power to "poison the souls" of those who read it. mordechai gifter delivered a pointed lecture on the subject, criticizing steinsaltz and his defenders in strong terms.
aharon feldman has penned a lengthy critical review of the steinsaltz talmud. among many criticisms, he writes, "specifically, the work is marred by an extraordinary number of inaccuracies stemming primarily from misreadings of the sources; it fails to explain those difficult passages which the reader would expect it to explain; and it confuses him with notes which are often irrelevant, incomprehensible, and contradictory." feldman says he fears that, "an intelligent student utilizing the steinsaltz talmud as his personal instructor might in fact conclude that talmud in general is not supposed to make sense." furthermore, writes feldman, the steinsaltz talmud gives off the impression that the talmud is intellectually flabby, inconsistent, and often trivial.
while certain members of the haredi community might not agree with steinsaltz's work, other jewish leaders, rabbis, and authors have spoken or written about their appreciation for steinsaltz's unique educational approach. rabbi john rosove of temple israel of hollywood featured “opening the tanya”, “learning the tanya”, and “understanding the tanya” on his list of the top ten recommended jewish books. these volumes are written by rabbi shneur zalman of liadi, the founder of the chabad lubavitch movement, and include commentary by rabbi steinsaltz. through reading the tanya, readers can explore all aspects of the central text of chabad movement. rabbi elie kaunfer, a rosh yeshiva and the ceo of mechon hadar yeshiva, discussed his gratitude for steinsaltz's global day of jewish learning and the opportunity created by this online platform for learning and creating a deeper connection to torah, other jewish text, and jews worldwide. rabbi pinchas allouche, who studied under rabbi steinsaltz, notes that steinsaltz “is a world scholar” who “revolutionized the jewish landscape” through his commentary, other writings, and educational organizations. other members of the jewish community, such as zeev katz, an israeli historian, have verbalized their appreciation of steinsaltz's contribution to historical education by comparing steinsaltz to rashi and maimonides, two great jewish sages of medieval times, and classifying him as “a once-in-a-millennium scholar”. in addition, ilana kurshan, an american-israeli author, wrote that steinsaltz's ability to bring “the historical world of the talmudic stages to life” created an enjoyable jewish learning experience for her when she was intensely studying talmud.

alfred edward housman (; 26 march 1859 – 30 april 1936), usually known as a. e. housman, was an english classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems "a shropshire lad". lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the english countryside. their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century english composers both before and after the first world war. through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with shropshire itself.
housman was one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars who ever lived. he established his reputation publishing as a private scholar and, on the strength and quality of his work, was appointed professor of latin at university college london and then at the university of cambridge. his editions of juvenal, manilius and lucan are still considered authoritative.
the eldest of seven children, housman was born at valley house in fockbury, a hamlet on the outskirts of bromsgrove in worcestershire, to sarah jane (née williams, married 17 june 1858 in woodchester, gloucester) and edward housman (whose family came from lancaster), and was baptised on 24 april 1859 at christ church, in catshill. his mother died on his twelfth birthday, and his father, a country solicitor, remarried, to an elder cousin, lucy, in 1873. two of his siblings became prominent writers, sister clemence housman and brother laurence housman.
housman was educated at king edward's school in birmingham and later bromsgrove school, where he revealed his academic promise and won prizes for his poems. in 1877 he won an open scholarship to st john's college, oxford and went there to study classics. although introverted by nature, housman formed strong friendships with two roommates, moses john jackson (1858 – january 14, 1923) and a. w. pollard. though housman obtained a first in classical moderations in 1879, his dedication to textual analysis, particularly of propertius, led him to neglect the ancient history and philosophy that formed part of the greats curriculum. accordingly, he failed his finals and had to return humiliated in michaelmas term to resit the exam and at least gain a lower-level pass degree. though some attribute housman's unexpected performance in his exams directly to his unrequited feelings for jackson, most biographers adduce more obvious causes. housman was indifferent to philosophy and overconfident in his exceptional gifts, and he spent too much time with his friends. he may also have been distracted by news of his father's desperate illness.
after oxford, jackson went to work as a clerk in the patent office in london and arranged a job there for housman too. the two shared a flat with jackson's brother adalbert until 1885, when housman moved to lodgings of his own, probably after jackson responded to a declaration of love by telling housman that he could not reciprocate his feelings. two years later, jackson moved to india, placing more distance between himself and housman. when he returned briefly to england in 1889, to marry, housman was not invited to the wedding and knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. adalbert jackson died in 1892 and housman commemorated him in a poem published as "xlii – a.j.j." of "more poems" (1936).
meanwhile, housman pursued his classical studies independently, and published scholarly articles on such authors as horace, propertius, ovid, aeschylus, euripides and sophocles. he gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered and accepted the professorship of latin at university college london (ucl). when, during his tenure, an immensely rare coverdale bible of 1535 was discovered in the ucl library and presented to the library committee, housman (who had become an atheist while still an undergraduate) remarked that it would be better to sell it to "buy some really useful books with the proceeds".
although housman's early work and his responsibilities as a professor included both latin and greek, he began to specialise in latin poetry. when asked later why he had stopped writing about greek verse, he responded, "i found that i could not attain to excellence in both." in 1911 he took the kennedy professorship of latin at trinity college, cambridge, where he remained for the rest of his life. g. p. goold, classics professor at university college, wrote of housman's accomplishments: "the legacy of housman's scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work … he was and may remain the last great textual critic." between 1903 and 1930 housman published his critical edition of manilius's "astronomicon" in five volumes. he also edited works by juvenal (1905) and lucan (1926).
many colleagues were unnerved by his scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship. in his paper "the application of thought to textual criticism" (1921) housman wrote: "a textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas." he declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: "knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head."
his younger colleague a. s. f. gow quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they "were often savage in the extreme". gow also related how housman intimidated his students, sometimes reducing the women to tears. according to gow, housman (when teaching at university college london where, unlike cambridge, he had students of both sexes) could never remember the names of his female students, maintaining that "had he burdened his memory by the distinction between miss jones and miss robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension". one of housman's notable pupils at cambridge was enoch powell.
in his private life housman enjoyed gastronomy, flying in aeroplanes and making frequent visits to france, where he read "books which were banned in britain as pornographic". but he struck a. c. benson, a fellow don, as being "descended from a long line of maiden aunts".
his feelings about his poetry were ambivalent and he certainly treated it as secondary to his scholarship. he did not speak in public about his poems until 1933, when he gave a lecture "the name and nature of poetry", arguing there that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.
housman died, aged 77, in cambridge. his ashes are buried just outside st laurence's church, ludlow, shropshire.
during his years in london, a. e. housman completed "a shropshire lad", a cycle of 63 poems. after one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. at first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. its appeal to english musicians had helped to make it widely known before world war i, when its themes struck a powerful chord with english readers. the book has been in print continuously since may 1896.
the poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation. housman wrote many of them while living in highgate, london, before ever visiting shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'. housman himself acknowledged that "no doubt i have been unconsciously influenced by the greeks and latins, but [the] chief sources of which i am conscious are shakespeare's songs, the scottish border ballads, and heine."
housman began writing a new set of poems after the first world war. he was an influence on many british poets who became famous by their writing about the war, and wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. this included his "epitaph on an army of mercenaries", honouring the british expeditionary force, an elite but small force of professional soldiers, 'a rapier amongst scythes' sent to belgium at the start of the war. fighting a well-equipped and much larger german army, they suffered heavy losses.
in the early 1920s, when moses jackson was dying in canada, housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that jackson could read them before his death. these later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in "a shropshire lad" but lack the consistency of his previously published work. he published them as "last poems" (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. after his death housman's brother, laurence, published further poems in "more poems" (1936), "a. e .h.: some poems, some letters and a personal memoir by his brother" (1937), and "collected poems" (1939). "a. e. h." includes humorous verse such as a parody of longfellow's poem "excelsior". housman also wrote a parodic "fragment of a greek tragedy", in english, published posthumously with humorous poems under the title "unkind to unicorns".
john sparrow quoted a letter written late in housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:
sparrow himself adds, "how difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in "a shropshire lad". of its four stanzas, housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. no one can tell for certain which was which."
in 1942 laurence housman also deposited an essay entitled "a. e. housman's 'de amicitia'" (there is a link to the text, below in this article, under "further reading") in the british library, with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. the essay discussed a. e. housman's homosexuality and his love for moses jackson. despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in "a shropshire lad", about his deeper sympathies. poem xxx of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how "fear contended with desire": "others, i am not the first, / have willed more mischief than they durst". in "more poems", he buries his love for moses jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave:
<poem>
</poem>
his poem "oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?", written after the trial of oscar wilde, addressed more general attitudes towards homosexuals. in the poem the prisoner is suffering "for the colour of his hair", a natural quality that, in a coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as "nameless and abominable" (recalling the legal phrase "peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum", "that horrible sin, not to be named amongst christians").
housman's poetry, especially "a shropshire lad", was set to music by many british, and in particular english, composers in the first half of the 20th century. the national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in english music. in 1904 the cycle "a shropshire lad" was set by arthur somervell, who had begun to develop the concept of the english song-cycle in his version of tennyson's "maud" a little previously. ralph vaughan williams produced his well-known settings of six songs, the cycle "on wenlock edge", for string quartet, tenor and piano in 1909. between 1909 and 1911 george butterworth produced settings in two collections, "six songs from a shropshire lad" and "bredon hill and other songs". he also wrote the orchestral tone poem "a shropshire lad", first performed at leeds festival in 1912.
ivor gurney was another composer who made renowned settings of housman's poems. towards the end of world war 1 he was working on his cycle "ludlow and teme", for voice and string quartet (published in 1919), and went on to compose the eight-song cycle "the western playland" in 1921. one more who set housman songs at this period was john ireland in the song cycle, "the land of lost content" (192021). even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as arnold bax, lennox berkeley and arthur bliss, were attracted to housman's poetry. a 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of housman's poems. as of 2016, lieder net archive records 606 settings of 187 texts.
the earliest commemoration of housman was in the chapel of trinity college in cambridge, where there is a memorial brass on the south wall. the latin inscription was composed by his colleague there, a.s.f. gow, who was also the author of a biographical and bibliographical sketch published immediately following his death. translated into english, the memorial reads:
from 1947, university college london's academic common room was dedicated to his memory as the housman room. blue plaques followed later elsewhere, the first being on byron cottage in highgate in 1969, recording the fact that "a shropshire lad" was written there. more followed on his worcestershire birthplace, his homes and school in bromsgrove. the latter were encouraged by the housman society, which was founded in the town in 1973. another initiative was the statue in bromsgrove high street, showing the poet striding with walking stick in hand. the work of local sculptor kenneth potts, it was unveiled on 22 march 1985.
the blue plaques in worcestershire were set up on the centenary of "a shropshire lad" in 1996. in september of the same year a memorial window lozenge was dedicated at poets' corner in westminster abbey the following year saw the première of tom stoppard's play "the invention of love", whose subject is the relationship between housman and moses jackson.
as the 150th anniversary of his birth approached, london university inaugurated its housman lectures on classical subjects in 2005, initially given every second year then annually after 2011. the anniversary itself in 2009 saw the launch of a new edition of "a shropshire lad", including pictures from across shropshire taken by local photographer gareth thomas. among other events, there were performances of vaughan williams' "on wenlock edge" and gurney's "ludlow and teme" at st laurence's church in ludlow.
these lectures are listed by date of delivery, with date of first publication given separately if different.

attribution of recent climate change is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent global warming and related climate changes on earth. the effort has focused on changes observed during the period of instrumental temperature record, particularly in the last 50 years. this is the period when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the atmosphere above the surface have become available. according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), it is "extremely likely" that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010. the best estimate is that observed warming since 1951 has been entirely human caused.
some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are:
in addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause climate change, including for example, climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity.
multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities:
the ipcc's attribution of recent global warming to human activities is a view shared by the scientific community, and is also supported by 196 other scientific organizations worldwide (see also: scientific opinion on climate change).
factors affecting earth's climate can be broken down into feedbacks and forcings. a forcing is something that is imposed externally on the climate system. external forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output. human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.
radiative forcing is a measure of how various factors alter the energy balance of the earth's atmosphere. a positive radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. between the start of the industrial revolution in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (chemical formula: ) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the earth's surface area, of about 1.66 watts per square metre (abbreviated w m).
climate feedbacks can either amplify or dampen the response of the climate to a given forcing.
there are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (a positive feedback) or diminish (a negative feedback) the effects of a change in climate forcing.
the climate system will vary in response to changes in forcings.
the climate system will show internal variability both in the presence and absence of forcings imposed on it, (see images opposite). this internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean (see also the later section on internal climate variability and global warming). an example of internal variability is the el niño–southern oscillation.
detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the ipcc. detection of a climate signal does not always imply significant attribution. the ipcc's fourth assessment report says "it is "extremely likely" that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%. "detection" of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is statistically significantly different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.
"attribution" requires demonstrating that a signal is:
carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change. is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through animal and plant respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange. human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use (see below), release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere, causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise.
the high-accuracy measurements of atmospheric concentration, initiated by charles david keeling in 1958, constitute the master time series documenting the changing composition of the atmosphere. these data have iconic status in climate change science as evidence of the effect of human activities on the chemical composition of the global atmosphere.
in may 2019 the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere reached 415 ppm. the last time when it reached this level was 2.6 - 5.3 million years ago. without human intervention, it would be 280 ppm.
along with , methane and to a lesser extent nitrous oxide are also major forcing contributors to the greenhouse effect. the kyoto protocol lists these together with hydrofluorocarbon (hfcs), perfluorocarbons (pfcs), and sulfur hexafluoride (sf), which are entirely artificial gases, as contributors to radiative forcing. the chart at right attributes anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to eight main economic sectors, of which the largest contributors are power stations (many of which burn coal or other fossil fuels), industrial processes, transportation fuels (generally fossil fuels), and agricultural by-products (mainly methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from fertilizer use).
water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and is the largest contributor to the natural greenhouse effect, despite having a short atmospheric lifetime (about 10 days). some human activities can influence local water vapor levels. however, on a global scale, the concentration of water vapor is controlled by temperature, which influences overall rates of evaporation and precipitation. therefore, the global concentration of water vapor is not substantially affected by direct human emissions.
climate change is attributed to land use for two main reasons. between 1750 and 2007, about two-thirds of anthropogenic emissions were produced from burning fossil fuels, and about one-third of emissions from changes in land use, primarily deforestation. deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through biomass burning that frequently accompanies it.
a second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the terrestrial albedo is often altered by use, which leads to radiative forcing. this effect is more significant locally than globally.
worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the ice-free land surface of the earth.
more than 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices. specific attributions to the livestock sector include:
with virtual certainty, scientific consensus has attributed various forms of climate change, chiefly cooling effects, to aerosols, which are small particles or droplets suspended in the atmosphere.
key sources to which anthropogenic aerosols are attributed include:
over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. this has led to increases in mean global temperature, or global warming. other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate aerosols are believed to have a cooling effect. natural factors also contribute. according to the historical temperature record of the last century, the earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 ± 0.18 °celsius (1.3 ± 0.32 °fahrenheit).
a historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-anthropogenic causes during the period of instrumental record. in the 1995 second assessment report (sar), the ipcc made the widely quoted statement that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". the phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (english) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". in 2001 the third assessment report (tar) refined this, saying "there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities". the 2007 fourth assessment report (ar4) strengthened this finding:
other findings of the ipcc fourth assessment report include:
over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65 °c (1.17 °f) at the earth's surface (see historical temperature record). among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably , is mostly responsible for the observed warming. evidence for this conclusion includes:
recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on scientific literature and opinion). this conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. no single study is a "smoking gun." nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.
the first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. the second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. these records are obtained from living things and their remains (like tree rings and corals) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier isotopes of oxygen in ice cores), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. the lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. for the northern hemisphere, the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).
the third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. for example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a rise in global sea level, retreat of sea ice and snow cover, cooling of the stratosphere, an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale precipitation and pressure patterns. these and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.
finally, there is extensive statistical evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. in the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the industrial revolution are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. the importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. of course, there are not multiple earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. for example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.
for example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. when human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). the clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.
another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on solar activity). the earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the tropopause (the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, drought, surface pressure, and the runoff from major river basins.
studies published after the appearance of the ipcc fourth assessment report in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric moisture (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of arctic sea ice extent, and in the patterns of changes in arctic and antarctic surface temperatures.
the message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and circulation patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.
increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. as noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. for example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in snowpack, maximum and minimum (diurnal) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over mountainous regions of the western united states. human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in hurricane formation regions. researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.
for over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. in the tropics, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). this issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. it is now largely resolved. research showed that there were large uncertainties in the satellite and weather balloon data. when uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.
this does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. the observed changes in some climate variables, such as arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. the reasons for these differences are not well understood. nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.
one of the subjects discussed in the literature is whether or not extreme weather events can be attributed to human activities. seneviratne "et al." (2012) stated that attributing individual extreme weather events to human activities was challenging. they were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. for example, seneviratne "et al." (2012) concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.
another way of viewing the problem is to consider the effects of human-induced climate change on the probability of future extreme weather events. stott "et al." (2003), for example, considered whether or not human activities had increased the risk of severe heat waves in europe, like the one experienced in 2003. their conclusion was that human activities had very likely more than doubled the risk of heat waves of this magnitude.
an analogy can be made between an athlete on steroids and human-induced climate change. in the same way that an athlete's performance may increase from using steroids, human-induced climate change increases the risk of some extreme weather events.
hansen "et al." (2012) suggested that human activities have greatly increased the risk of summertime heat waves. according to their analysis, the land area of the earth affected by very hot summer temperature anomalies has greatly increased over time (refer to graphs on the left). in the base period 1951-1980, these anomalies covered a few tenths of 1% of the global land area. in recent years, this has increased to around 10% of the global land area. with high confidence, hansen "et al." (2012) attributed the 2010 moscow and 2011 texas heat waves to human-induced global warming.
an earlier study by dole "et al." (2011) concluded that the 2010 moscow heatwave was mostly due to natural weather variability. while not directly citing dole "et al." (2011), hansen "et al." (2012) rejected this type of explanation. hansen "et al." (2012) stated that a combination of natural weather variability and human-induced global warming was responsible for the moscow and texas heat waves.
there are a number of examples of published and informal support for the consensus view. as mentioned earlier, the ipcc has concluded that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is "very likely" due to human activities. the ipcc's conclusions are consistent with those of several reports produced by the us national research council.
a report published in 2009 by the u.s. global change research program concluded that "[global] warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced."
a number of scientific organizations have issued statements that support the consensus view. two examples include:
the ipcc fourth assessment report (2007), concluded that attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see effects of global warming). however, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).
over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.
as described above, a small minority of scientists do disagree with the consensus: see list of scientists opposing global warming consensus. for example, willie soon and richard lindzen say that there is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution. generally this position requires new physical mechanisms to explain the observed warming.
solar sunspot maximum occurs when the magnetic field of the sun collapses and reverse as part of its average 11 year solar cycle (22 years for complete north to north restoration).
the role of the sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. since 1978, output from the sun has been measured by satellites significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. these measurements indicate that the sun's total solar irradiance has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed to an increase in total solar energy reaching the earth (see graph above, left). in the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.
climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.
models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in total solar irradiance and volcanic activity. models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. as has already been stated, hegerl "et al." (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. in making this conclusion, hegerl "et al." (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.
the role of solar activity in climate change has also been calculated over longer time periods using "proxy" datasets, such as tree rings.
models indicate that solar and volcanic forcings can explain periods of relative warmth and cold between a.d. 1000 and 1900, but human-induced forcings are needed to reproduce the late-20th century warming.
another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the earth's atmosphere have changed.
models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere). depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. if the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. the stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of uv irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.
habibullo abdussamatov (2004), head of space research at st. petersburg's pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia, has argued that the sun is responsible for recently observed climate change. journalists for news sources canada.com (solomon, 2007b), national geographic news (ravillious, 2007), and livescience (than, 2007) reported on the story of warming on mars. in these articles, abdussamatov was quoted. he stated that warming on mars was evidence that global warming on earth was being caused by changes in the sun.
ravillious (2007) quoted two scientists who disagreed with abdussamatov: amato evan, a climate scientist at the university of wisconsin–madison, in the us, and colin wilson, a planetary physicist at oxford university in the uk. according to wilson, "wobbles in the orbit of mars are the main cause of its climate change in the current era" (see also orbital forcing). than (2007) quoted charles long, a climate physicist at pacific northwest national laboratories in the us, who disagreed with abdussamatov.
than (2007) pointed to the view of benny peiser, a social anthropologist at liverpool john moores university in the uk. in his newsletter, peiser had cited a blog that had commented on warming observed on several planetary bodies in the solar system. these included neptune's moon triton, jupiter, pluto and mars. in an e-mail interview with than (2007), peiser stated that:"i think it is an intriguing coincidence that warming trends have been observed on a number of very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system, (...) perhaps this is just a fluke."than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on triton, pluto, jupiter and mars.
the us environmental protection agency (us epa, 2009) responded to public comments on climate change attribution. a number of commenters had argued that recent climate change could be attributed to changes in solar irradiance. according to the us epa (2009), this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature. citing the work of the ipcc (2007), the us epa pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750. over this time period (1750 to 2005), the estimated contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing was 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (see graph opposite).
henrik svensmark has suggested that the magnetic activity of the sun deflects cosmic rays, and that this may influence the generation of cloud condensation nuclei, and thereby have an effect on the climate. the website sciencedaily reported on a 2009 study that looked at how past changes in climate have been affected by the earth's magnetic field. geophysicist mads faurschou knudsen, who co-authored the study, stated that the study's results supported svensmark's theory. the authors of the study also acknowledged that plays an important role in climate change.
the view that cosmic rays could provide the mechanism by which changes in solar activity affect climate is not supported by the literature. solomon "et al." (2007) state:[..] the cosmic ray time series does not appear to correspond to global total cloud cover after 1991 or to global low-level cloud cover after 1994. together with the lack of a proven physical mechanism and the plausibility of other causal factors affecting changes in cloud cover, this makes the association between galactic cosmic ray-induced changes in aerosol and cloud formation controversial
studies by lockwood and fröhlich (2007) and sloan and wolfendale (2008) found no relation between warming in recent decades and cosmic rays. pierce and adams (2009) used a model to simulate the effect of cosmic rays on cloud properties. they concluded that the hypothesized effect of cosmic rays was too small to explain recent climate change. pierce and adams (2009) noted that their findings did not rule out a possible connection between cosmic rays and climate change, and recommended further research.
erlykin "et al." (2009) found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays, and concluded: "hence within our assumptions, the effect of varying solar activity, either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates, must be less than 0.07 °c since 1956, i.e. less than 14% of the observed global warming." carslaw (2009) and pittock (2009) review the recent and historical literature in this field and continue to find that the link between cosmic rays and climate is tenuous, though they encourage continued research. us epa (2009) commented on research by duplissy "et al." (2009):the cloud experiments at cern are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. preliminary results from the experiment (duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. these experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. there is no indication that the earlier svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the cern experiment. we find that the svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage

achduart (gaelic: achadh dhubhaird) is a small hamlet in coigach, in wester ross in northwestern scotland, now within the highland council area. it is situated about 4 km southeast of the village of achiltibuie, at the end of a minor road. a footpath continues on to the hamlet of culnacraig, then along the coast past ben more coigach to strathcanaird.
achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the ocean as well as its seclusion and remoteness. there is a scottish youth hostels association hostel in acheninver, a short distance to the north.
the name of achduart comes from the gaelic for "the field at the black headland". achduart was part of the estate of coigach, lochbroom, belonging to the countess of cromartie.
the dominant geographical feature in the area is cairn conmheall, which rises to 541 metres.

achiltibuie (; or "field of the yellow-haired boy") is a long linear village in ross and cromarty, highland, on the coigach coast of northwestern scotland, overlooking badentarbet bay to the west. loch broom and the summer isles lie to the south. located 10 miles (16 km) northwest of ullapool as the crow flies. achiltibuie is the central community of a series of townships and communities stretching from culnacraig, through badenscallie and polglass (where the community hall, the primary school and the piping school are located), polbain, and reiff to achnahaird.
the first post office in the village opened on 28 july 1884.
for a time the "summer isles smokehouse" attracted visitors. in 2013 the community had hopes to re-establish the business.
the hydroponicum, a facility for growing fresh fruit and vegetables indoors using hydroponics, was built in the village in the 1980s by robert irvine, then owner of the summer isles hotel. the hydroponicum was known for growing exotic fruit such as bananas all year round. it attracted up to 10,000 visitors a year until it was sold in 2007 to a company based in the isle of man. new greenhouses have since been built apart from the original hydroponicum buildings, and the new owners continue to grow fruit and vegetables for local businesses and residents. a community buyout attempt in 2011 by the coigach community development company fell through when the site's sellers pulled out. the building has now been demolished. some of the former staff of the hydroponicum run a small-scale activity known as the achiltibuie garden, situated nearby.
'coigach community rowing' the crew members of which coastal rowing club are all local, won the world st. ayles skiff rowing championships in july 2013 and a mixed crew from the club won the alan spong trophy for 1st mixed crew 4-oar rowing at the thames great river race in september 2013. coigach community rowing hand-built their two st ayles rowing skiffs, the 'coigach lass' and the 'lily~rose' and race under the auspices of the scottish coastal rowing association, which is the governing body of st ayles class coastal rowing around the world.
the roman epic movie "the eagle", based on the 1954 novel "the eagle of the ninth" by rosemary sutcliff, was filmed on location in achiltibuie for a week in october 2009. the main location was fox point, old dornie. the pictish village which was constructed at fox point was used on most days of the filming. other sites included achnahaird beach where a horse chase was filmed and loch lurgainn.
the village and its residents featured in "the wee mad road" (2008) by jack and barbara maloney.
achiltibuie is also the setting of a humorous german book about scotland by reiner luyken, "schotten dicht" (2015) published by ullstein verlag, berlin. luyken was a multiple award-winning foreign correspondent of the german weekly paper "die zeit" until his retirement in 2017. he lives near achiltibuie since 1978.

in economics, adaptive expectations is a hypothesized process by which people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past. for example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future.
one simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where formula_1 is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected; formula_2is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and formula_3 is this year's actual rate of inflation:
where formula_5 is between 0 and 1. this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an "error-adjustment" term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations. this error-adjustment is also called ""partial adjustment"."
the theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal:
where formula_7 equals actual inflation formula_8 years in the past. thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past.
once a forecasting error is made by agents, due to a stochastic shock, they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors. the backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents (see cobweb model) was unsatisfactory to economists such as john muth, who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed, called rational expectations. this has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory. however, it must be stressed that confronting adaptivity and rationality is not necessarily justified, in other words, there are situations in which following the adaptive scheme is a rational response.
adaptive expectations were instrumental in the phillips curve outlined by milton friedman. for friedman, workers form adaptive expectations, so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. as agents are trapped by the money illusion, they are unable to correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. the result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate for an extended period of time. however, in this framework it is clear why and how adaptive expectations are problematic. agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. for example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. this is the reason why the theory of adaptive expectations is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.

the mexican tetra or blind cave fish ("astyanax mexicanus") is a freshwater fish of the family characidae of the order characiformes. the type species of its genus, it is native to the nearctic ecozone, originating in the lower rio grande and the neueces and pecos rivers in texas, as well as the central and eastern parts of mexico.
growing to a maximum total length of , the mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration. its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes or pigment; it has a pinkish-white color to its body (resembling an albino).
this fish, especially the blind variant, is reasonably popular among aquarists.
"a. mexicanus" is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in midlevel water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment. coming from a subtropical climate, it prefers water with 6.5–8 ph, a hardness of up to 30 dgh, and a temperature range of . in the winter, some populations migrates to warmer waters. its natural diet consists of crustaceans, insects, and annelids, although in captivity it is omnivorous.
the mexican tetra has been treated as a subspecies of "a. fasciatus", but this is not widely accepted. additionally, the blind cave form is sometimes recognized as a separate species, "a. jordani", but this directly contradicts phylogenetic evidence.
"a. mexicanus" is famous for its blind cave form, which is known by such names as blind cave tetra, blind tetra (leading to easy confusion with the brazilian "stygichthys typhlops"), blind cave characin and blind cavefish. depending on the exact population, cave forms can have degenerated sight or have total loss of sight and even their eyes. the fish in the pachón caves have lost their eyes completely whilst the fish from the micos cave only have limited sight.
cave fish and surface fish are able to produce fertile offspring.
these fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their lateral lines, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating water pressure. currently, about 30 cave populations are known, dispersed over three geographically distinct areas in a karst region of san luis potosí and far southern tamaulipas, northeastern mexico. among the various cave population are at least three with only full cave forms (blind and without pigment), at least eleven with cave, "normal" and intermediate forms, and at least one with both cave and "normal" forms but no intermediates. studies suggest at least two distinct genetic lineages occur among the blind populations, and the current distribution of populations arose by at least five independent invasions.
the eyed and eyeless forms of "a. mexicanus", being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed making this species an excellent model organism for examining convergent and parallel evolution, regressive evolution in cave animals, and the genetic basis of regressive traits. this, combined with the ease of maintaining the species in captivity, has made it the most studied cavefish and likely also the most studied cave organism overall.
the blind and colorless cave form of "a. mexicanus" is sometimes recognized as a separate species, "a. jordani", but this leaves the remaining "a. mexicanus" as a paraphyletic species and "a. jordani" as polyphyletic. the cueva chica cave in the southern part of the sierra del abra system is the type locality for "a. jordani". other blind populations were initially also recognized as separate species, including "antrobius" described in 1946 from the pachón cave and "hubbsi" described in 1947 from the los sabinos cave (both subsequently merged into "jordani"/"mexicanus"). the most divergent cave population is the one in los sabinos.
another cave-adapted population of "astyanax", varying from blind and depigmented to individuals showing intermediate features, is known from the granadas cave, part of the balsas river drainage in guerrero, southern mexico, but it is a part of "a. aeneus" (itself sometimes included in "a. mexicanus").
the surface and cave forms of the mexican tetra have proven powerful subjects for scientists studying evolution. when the surface-dwelling ancestors of current cave populations entered the subterranean environment, the change in ecological conditions rendered their phenotype—which included many biological functions dependent on the presence of light—subject to natural selection and genetic drift. one of the most striking changes to evolve was the loss of eyes. this is referred to as a "regressive trait" because the surface fish that originally colonized caves possessed eyes. in addition to regressive traits, cave forms evolved "constructive traits". in contrast to regressive traits, the purpose or benefit of constructive traits is generally accepted. active research focuses on the mechanisms driving the evolution of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes, in "a. mexicanus". recent studies have produced evidence that the mechanism may be direct selection, or indirect selection through antagonistic pleiotropy, rather than genetic drift and neutral mutation, the traditionally favored hypothesis for regressive evolution.
the blind form of the mexican tetra is different from the surface-dwelling form in a number of ways, including having unpigmented skin, having a better olfactory sense by having taste buds all over its head, and by being able to store four times more energy as fat, allowing it to deal with irregular food supplies more effectively.
darwin said of sightless fish:
modern genetics has made clear that the lack of use does not, in itself, necessitate a feature's disappearance. in this context, the positive genetic benefits have to be considered, i.e., what advantages are obtained by cave-dwelling tetras by losing their eyes? possible explanations include:
another likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of selective neutrality and genetic drift; in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population.
among some creationists, the cave tetra is seen as evidence 'against' evolution. one argument claims this is an instance of "devolution"—showing an evolutionary trend of decreasing complexity. but evolution is a non-directional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.
inhibition of the hsp90 protein has a dramatic effect in the development of the blind tetra.
the blind cave tetras seen in the aquarium trade are all based on stock collected in the cueva chica cave in the southern part of the sierra del abra system in 1936. these were sent to an aquarium company in texas, who soon started to distribute them to aquarists. since then, these have been selectively bred for their troglomorphic traits. today large numbers are bred at commercial facilities, especially in asia.
the blind cave tetra is a hardy species. their lack of sight does not hinder their ability to get food. they prefer subdued lighting with a rocky substrate, like gravel, mimicking their natural environment. they become semi-aggressive as they age, and are by nature schooling fish. experiments have shown that keeping these fish in bright aquarium set-ups has no effect on the development of the skin flap that forms over their eyes as they grow.

the atom probe was introduced at the 14th field emission symposium in 1967 by erwin wilhelm müller and j. a. panitz. it combined a field ion microscope with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could “... determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer”.
atom probes are unlike conventional optical or electron microscopes, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. the method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface. through coupling of this magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed.
through successive evaporation of material, layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not only of the surface, but also through the material itself. computer methods are used to rebuild a three-dimensional view of the sample, prior to it being evaporated, providing atomic scale information on the structure of a sample, as well as providing the type atomic species information. the instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-10,000,000 nm).
atom probe samples are shaped to implicitly provide a highly curved electric potential to induce the resultant magnification, as opposed to direct use of lensing, such as via magnetic lenses. furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. rather, the sample is evaporated in a controlled manner (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which is typically 10 to 100 cm away.
the samples are required to have a needle geometry and are produced by similar techniques as tem sample preparation electropolishing, or focused ion beam methods. since 2006, commercial systems with laser pulsing have become available and this has expanded applications from metallic only specimens into semiconducting, insulating such as ceramics, and even geological materials.
preparation is done, often by hand, to manufacture a tip radius sufficient to induce a high electric field, with radii on the order of 100 nm.
to conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. after introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100 k) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. a high voltage is applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kv) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. the application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. the delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.
whilst the uncertainty in the atomic mass computed by time-of-flight methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.
field ion microscopy is a modification of field emission microscopy where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp needle-like "tip" cathode when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6 v/nm). the needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the work function at the tip apex. the image resolution is limited to (2-2.5 nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.
in field ion microscopy the tip is cooled by a cryogen and its polarity is reversed. when an "imaging gas" (usually hydrogen or helium) is introduced at low pressures (< 0.1 pascal) gas ions in the high electric field at the tip apex are "field ionized" and produce a projected image of protruding atoms at the tip apex. the image resolution is determined primarily by the temperature of the tip but even at 78 kelvin atomic resolution is achieved.
the 10-cm atom probe, invented in 1973 by j. a. panitz was a “new and simple atom probe which permits rapid, in depth species identification or the more usual atom-by atom analysis provided by its predecessors ... in an instrument having a volume of less than two liters in which tip movement is unnecessary and the problems of evaporation pulse stability and alignment common to previous designs have been eliminated.” this was accomplished by combining a time of flight (tof) mass spectrometer with a proximity focussed, dual channel plate detector, an 11.8 cm drift region and a 38° field of view. an fim image or a desorption image of the atoms removed from the apex of a field emitter tip could be obtained. the 10-cm atom probe has been called the "progenitor" of later atom probes including the commercial instruments.
the imaging atom-probe (iap) was introduced in 1974 by j. a. panitz. it incorporated the features of the 10-cm atom-probe yet “... departs completely from [previous] atom probe philosophy. rather than attempt to determine the identity of a surface species producing a preselected ion-image spot, we wish to determine the complete crystallographic distribution of a surface species of preselected mass-to-charge ratio. now suppose that instead of operating the [detector] continuously, it is turned on for a short time coincidentally with the arrival of a preselected species of interest by applying a "gate pulse" a time t after the evaporation pulse has reached the specimen. if the duration of the gate pulse is shorter than the travel time between adjacent species, only that surface species having the unique travel time t will be detected and its complete crystallographic distribution displayed.” it was patented in 1975 as the field desorption spectrometer. the imaging atom-probe moniker was coined by a. j. waugh in 1978 and the instrument was described in detail by j. a. panitz in the same year.
modern day atom probe tomography (apt) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms. the idea of the apt, inspired by j. a. panitz's "field desorption spectrometer" patent, was developed by mike miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986. various refinements were made to the instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (pos) detector by alfred cerezo, terence godfrey, and george d. w. smith at oxford university in 1988. the tomographic atom probe (tap), developed by researchers at the university of rouen in france in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. both instruments (posap and tap) were commercialized by oxford nanoscience and cameca respectively. since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. the local electrode atom probe was first introduced in 2003 by imago scientific instruments. in 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (plap) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials. ametek acquired cameca in 2007 and imago scientific instruments (madison, wi) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of apts with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.
the first few decades of work with apt focused on metals. however, more recent work has been done on semiconductors, ceramic and geologic materials, with some work on biomaterials. the most advanced study of biological material to date using apt involved analyzing the chemical structure of teeth of the radula of chiton "chaetopleura apiculata". in this study, the use of apt showed chemical maps of organic fibers in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite in the chiton teeth, fibers which were often co-located with sodium or magnesium. this has been furthered to study elephant tusks, dentin and human enamel.
field evaporation is an effect that can occur when an atom bonded at the surface of a material is in the presence of a sufficiently high and appropriately directed electric field, where the electric field is the differential of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance. once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.
whether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample.
subsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the electrostatic equation, where "n" is the ionisation state of the ion, and "e" is the fundamental electric charge.
this can be equated with the mass of the ion, "m", via newton's law (f=ma):
relativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.
assuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity. as the ion will travel from the tip at voltage v to some nominal ground potential, the speed at which the ion is travelling can be estimated by the energy transferred into the ion during (or near) ionisation. therefore, the ion speed can be computed with the following equation, which relates kinetic energy to energy gain due to the electric field, the negative arising from the loss of electrons forming a net positive charge.
where "u" is the ion velocity. solving for "u", the following relation is found:
let's say that for at a certain ionization voltage, a singly charged hydrogen ion acquires a resulting velocity of x ms. a singly charged deuterium ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly x/1.41 ms. if a detector was placed at a distance of 1 m, the ion flight times would be 1/x and 1.41/x s. thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.
from the above equation, it can be re-arranged to show that
given a known flight distance. f, for the ion, and a known flight time, t,
and thus one can substitute these values to obtain the mass-to-charge for the ion.
thus for an ion which traverses a 1 m flight path, across a time of 2000 ns, given an initial accelerating voltage of 5000 v (v in si units is kg.m^2.s^-3.a^-1) and noting that one amu is 1×10 kg, the mass-to-charge ratio (more correctly the mass-to-ionisation value ratio) becomes ~3.86 amu/charge. the number of electrons removed, and thus net positive charge on the ion is not known directly, but can be inferred from the histogram (spectrum) of observed ions.
the magnification in an atom is due to the projection of ions radially away from the small, sharp tip. subsequently, in the far field, the ions will be greatly magnified. this magnification is sufficient to observe field variations due to individual atoms, thus allowing in field ion and field evaporation modes for the imaging of single atoms.
the standard projection model for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a conic section, such as a sphere, hyperboloid or paraboloid. for these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained analytically. the magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.
where r is the radius of the detection screen from the tip centre, and r the tip radius. practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same field of view.
practically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.
whilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependent upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional electron microscopes, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.
the computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position sensitive detector, to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed "reconstruction". reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and use empirical corrections to stereographic projection to convert detector positions back to a 2d surface embedded in 3d space, r. by sweeping this surface through r as a function of the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2d detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.
typically the sweep takes the simple form of an advancement of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. this causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton shuttlecock. the detected events thus become a point cloud data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.
this form of data manipulation allows for rapid computer visualisation and analysis, with data presented as point cloud data with additional information, such as each ion's mass to charge (as computed from the velocity equation above), voltage or other auxiliary measured quantity or computation therefrom.
the canonical feature of atom probe data, is its high spatial resolution in the direction through the material, which has been attributed to an ordered evaporation sequence. this data can therefore image near atomically sharp buried interfaces with the associated chemical information.
the data obtained from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. a key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. this corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.
the resultant deflection means that in these regions of high curvature, atomic terraces are belied by a strong anisotropy in the detection density. where this occurs due to a few atoms on a surface is usually referred to as a "pole", as these are coincident with the crystallographic axes of the specimen (fcc, bcc, hcp) etc. where the edges of an atomic terrace causes deflection, a low density line is formed and is termed a "zone line".
these poles and zone-lines, whilst inducing fluctuations in data density in the reconstructed datasets, which can prove problematic during post-analysis, are critical for determining information such as angular magnification, as the crystallographic relationships between features are typically well known.
when reconstructing the data, owing to the evaporation of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly anisotropic. determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as the resolution of the device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.
many designs have been constructed since the method's inception. initial field ion microscopes, precursors to modern atom probes, were usually glass blown devices developed by individual research laboratories.
at a minimum, an atom probe will consist of several key pieces of equipment.
optionally, an atom probe may also include laser-optical systems for laser beam targeting and pulsing, if using laser-evaporation methods. in-situ reaction systems, heaters, or plasma treatment may also be employed for some studies as well as pure noble gas introduction for fim.
collectable ion volumes were previously limited to several thousand, or tens of thousands of ionic events. subsequent electronics and instrumentation development has increased the rate of data accumulation, with datasets of hundreds of million atoms (dataset volumes of 10 nm). data collection times vary considerably depending upon the experimental conditions and the number of ions collected. experiments take from a few minutes, to many hours to complete.
atom probe has typically been employed in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. this has arisen as a result of voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. metal samples from large grained alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.
subsequently, atom probe has been used in the analysis of the chemical composition of a wide range of alloys.
such data is critical in determining the effect of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. tem) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.
semi-conductor materials are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation may be more difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, particularly if the semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.
applications such as ion implantation may be used to identify the distribution of dopants inside a semi-conducting material, which is increasingly critical in the correct design of modern nanometre scale electronics.

alphonse gabriel capone (, ; january 17, 1899 – january 25, 1947), better known as al capone, and sometimes by the nickname "scarface", was an american gangster and businessman who attained notoriety during the prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the chicago outfit. his seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33.
capone was born in new york city, to italian immigrants. he was a five points gang member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. in his early twenties, he moved to chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for johnny torrio, head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the outfit—and was politically protected through the unione siciliana. a conflict with the north side gang was instrumental in capone's rise and fall. torrio went into retirement after north side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to capone. capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor william hale thompson and the city's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement.
capone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. he made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as "modern-day robin hood". however, the saint valentine's day massacre, in which seven gang rivals were murdered in broad daylight, damaged chicago's and capone's image, leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub capone "public enemy no. 1".
the federal authorities became intent on jailing capone and prosecuted him in 1931 for tax evasion. during a highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence capone's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government taxes he owed. he was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. after conviction, he replaced his defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a supreme court ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed. capone showed signs of neurosyphilis early in his sentence and became increasingly debilitated before being released after almost eight years of incarceration. on january 25, 1947, capone died of cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke.
al capone was born in brooklyn, new york on january 17, 1899. his parents were italian immigrants gabriele capone (1865–1920) and teresa capone (née raiola; 1867–1952). his father was a barber and his mother was a seamstress, both born in angri, a town in the province of salerno.
gabriele and teresa had nine children: alphonse "al" capone; vincenzo capone, who later changed his name to richard hart and became a prohibition agent in homer, nebraska; raffaele james capone, aka ralph "bottles" capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; salvatore "frank" capone, ermina capone, who died at the age of one, ermino "john" capone, albert capone, matthew capone, and mafalda capone (who married john j. maritote). ralph and frank worked with him in his criminal empire. frank did so until his death on april 1, 1924. ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the chicago outfit for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.
the capone family immigrated to the united states, after first moving to nearby fiume in austria-hungary in 1893. from that port city they traveled on a ship to the u.s., where they settled at 95 navy street, in the navy yard section of downtown brooklyn. gabriele capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 park avenue. when al was 11, the capone family moved to 38 garfield place in park slope, brooklyn.
capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial catholic school. his schooling ended at the age of 14, after he was expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face. he worked at odd jobs around brooklyn, including a candy store and a bowling alley. during this time, capone was influenced by gangster johnny torrio, whom he came to regard as a mentor.
capone initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the junior forty thieves and the bowery boys. he then joined the brooklyn rippers, and then the powerful five points gang based in lower manhattan. during this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer frankie yale, a bartender in a coney island dance hall and saloon called the harvard inn. capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a brooklyn night club and was slashed by her brother frank gallucio. the wounds led to the nickname "scarface" which capone loathed. when he was photographed, he hid the scarred left side of his face, saying that the injuries were war wounds. he was called "snorky" by his closest friends, a term for a sharp dresser.
capone married mae josephine coughlin at age 19 on december 30, 1918. she was irish catholic and earlier that month had given birth to their son albert francis "sonny" capone (1918–2004), who had lost most of his hearing in his left ear as a child. capone was under the age of 21, and his parents had to consent in writing to the marriage. by all accounts, the two had a happy marriage despite his gang life.
at about 20 years of age, capone left new york for chicago at the invitation of johnny torrio, who was imported by crime boss james "big jim" colosimo as an enforcer. capone began in chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted syphilis. timely use of salvarsan probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment. in 1923, he purchased a small house at 7244 south prairie avenue in the park manor neighborhood on the city's south side for . in the early years of the decade, his name began appearing in newspaper sports pages where he was described as a boxing promoter. torrio took over colosimo's crime empire after colosimo's murder on may 11, 1920, in which capone was suspected of being involved.
torrio headed an essentially italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with capone as his right-hand man. he was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. the smaller north side gang led by dean o'banion (also known as dion o'banion) was of mixed ethnicity, and it came under pressure from the genna brothers who were allied with torrio. o'banion found that torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the gennas into the north side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes. in a fateful step, torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of o'banion at his flower shop in october 1924. this placed hymie weiss at the head of the gang, backed by vincent drucci and bugs moran. weiss had been a close friend of o'banion, and the north siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.
al capone was a frequent visitor to ryemabee in monteagle, tennessee "when he was traveling between chicago and his florida estate in miami."
in january 1925, capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. twelve days later, torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. after recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. in turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue. an establishment that refused to purchase liquor from him often got blown up, and as many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. rivals saw capone as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.
capone indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was templeton rye from iowa), and female companionship. he was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. his favorite responses to questions about his activities were: "i am just a businessman, giving the people what they want"; and, "all i do is satisfy a public demand." capone had become a national celebrity and talking point.
he based himself in cicero, illinois after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over town council elections, and this made it difficult for the north siders to target him. his driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on weiss's life in the chicago loop. on september 20, 1926, the north side gang used a ploy outside the capone headquarters at the hawthorne inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. gunmen in several cars then opened fire with thompson submachine guns and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. three weeks later, weiss was killed outside the former o'banion flower shop north side headquarters. the owner of hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of capone's, and he was kidnapped and killed by moran and drucci in january 1927.
capone became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from chicago. as a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of chicago's train depots and buy up an entire pullman sleeper car on a night train to cleveland, omaha, kansas city, little rock, or hot springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. in 1928, capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate august busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 palm avenue on palm island, florida in biscayne bay between miami and miami beach. he never registered any property under his name. he did not even have a bank account, but always used western union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000. in an effort to clean up his image, capone donated to charities and sponsored a soup kitchen in chicago during the depression.
the protagonists of chicago's politics had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation "wars", but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. capone is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of republican william hale thompson, especially in the 1927 mayoral race when thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons. such a proclamation helped his campaign gain the support of capone, and he allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster. in the 1927 mayoral race, thompson beat william emmett dever by a relatively slim margin. thompson's powerful cook county political machine had drawn on the often-parochial italian community, but this was in tension with his highly successful courting of african americans.
capone continued to back thompson. voting booths were targeted by capone's bomber james belcastro in the wards where thompson's opponents were thought to have support, on the polling day of april 10, 1928, in the so-called pineapple primary, causing the deaths of at least 15 people. belcastro was accused of the murder of lawyer octavius granady, an african american who challenged thompson's candidate for the african american vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. four policemen were among those charged along with belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. an indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to capone's organization came in 1931 when belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that belcastro was an independent operator.
the 1929 saint valentine's day massacre led to public disquiet about thompson's alliance with capone and was a factor in anton j. cermak winning the mayoral election on april 6, 1931.
capone was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 saint valentine's day massacre in an attempt to eliminate bugs moran, head of the north side gang. moran was the last survivor of the north side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors vincent drucci and hymie weiss had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader dean o'banion.
to monitor their targets' habits and movements, capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse and garage at 2122 north clark street, which served as moran's headquarters. on the morning of thursday, february 14, 1929, capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police officers to initiate a "police raid". the "faux" police lined the seven victims along a wall and signaled for accomplices armed with machine guns and shotguns. photos of the slain victims shocked the public and damaged capone's reputation. within days, capone received a summons to testify before a chicago grand jury on charges of federal prohibition violations, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend.
capone was primarily known for ordering other men to do his dirty work for him. one story, however, has capone, having discovered that three of his men—scalise, anselmi, and giunta—were conspiring against him with a rival gangster, joe aiello, reportedly arranging for the conspirators to dine with him and his bodyguards. after a night of drinking, capone beat the men with a baseball bat and then ordered his bodyguards to shoot them, a scene that was included in the 1987 film "the untouchables". deirdre bair, along with writers and historians such as william elliot hazelgrove, have questioned the veracity of the claim. bair questioned why "three trained killers could sit quietly and let this happen", while hazelgrove stated that capone would have been "hard pressed to beat three men to death with a baseball bat" and that he would have instead let an enforcer perform the murders. but despite claims that the story was first reported by author walter noble burns in his 1931 book "the one-way ride: the red trail of chicago gangland from prohibition to jake lingle", capone biographers max allan collins and a. brad schwartz have found versions of the story in press coverage shortly after the crime. collins and schwartz suggest that similarities among reported versions of the story indicate a basis in truth and that the outfit deliberately spread the tale to enhance capone's fearsome reputation. george meyer, an associate of capone's, also claimed to have witnessed both the planning of the murders and the event itself.
on march 27, 1929, capone was arrested by fbi agents as he left a chicago courtroom after testifying to a grand jury that was investigating violations of federal prohibition laws. he was charged with contempt of court for feigning illness to avoid an earlier appearance. on may 16, 1929, capone was arrested in philadelphia, pa for carrying a concealed weapon. on may 17, 1929, capone was indicted by a grand jury and a trial was held before philadelphia municipal court judge john e walsh. following the entering of a guilty plea by his attorney, capone was sentenced to a prison term of one year. on august 8, 1929, capone was transferred to philadelphia's eastern state penitentiary. a week after his release in march 1930, capone was listed as the number one "public enemy" on the unofficial chicago crime commission's widely publicized list.
in april 1930, capone was arrested on vagrancy charges when visiting miami beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state. capone claimed that miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. he was charged with perjury for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in july. in september, a chicago judge issued a warrant for capone's arrest on charges of vagrancy, and then used the publicity to run against thompson in the republican primary. in february 1931, capone was tried on the contempt of court charge. in court, judge james herbert wilkerson intervened to reinforce questioning of capone's doctor by the prosecutor. wilkerson sentenced capone to six months, but he remained free while on appeal of the contempt conviction.
assistant attorney general mabel walker willebrandt recognized that mob figures publicly led lavish lifestyles yet never filed tax returns, and thus could be convicted of tax evasion without requiring hard evidence to get testimony about their other crimes. she tested this approach by prosecuting a south carolina bootlegger, manley sullivan. in 1927, the supreme court ruled in "united states v. sullivan" that the approach was legally sound: illegally earned income was subject to income tax; justice oliver wendell holmes jr. rejected the argument that the fifth amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income.
the irs special investigation unit chose frank j. wilson to investigate capone, with the focus on his spending. the key to capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which wilkerson presided. capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. in 1931, capone was charged with income tax evasion, as well as with various violations of the volstead act (prohibition) at the chicago federal building in the courtroom of judge james herbert wilkerson. u. s. attorney george e. q. johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving capone a couple of years, but judge wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. on the second day of the trial, judge wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for capone.
much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied capone's control rather than stating it. the ledgers were inadmissible on grounds of statute of limitations, but capone's lawyers incompetently failed to make the necessary timely objection; they ran a basically irrelevant defense of gambling losses. judge wilkerson allowed capone's spending to be presented at very great length. there was no doubt that capone "spent" vast sums but, legally speaking, the case against him centered on the size of his "income". capone was convicted on october 17, and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes. the contempt of court sentence was served concurrently. new lawyers hired to represent capone were washington-based tax experts. they filed a writ of habeas corpus based on a supreme court ruling that tax evasion was not fraud, which apparently meant that capone had been convicted on charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution. however, a judge interpreted the law so that the time that capone had spent in miami was subtracted from the age of the offences, thereby denying the appeal of both capone's conviction and sentence.
capone was sent to atlanta u.s. penitentiary in may 1932, aged 33. upon his arrival at atlanta, the capone was officially diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhoea. he was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his nasal septum. capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent. he was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict red rudensky, feared that capone would have a breakdown. rudensky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the capone gang, and found himself becoming a protector for capone. the conspicuous protection of rudensky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates, and fueled suspicion that capone was receiving special treatment. no solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving capone to the recently opened alcatraz federal penitentiary off the coast of san francisco. on june 23, 1936, capone was stabbed and superficially wounded by james c. lucas.
at alcatraz, capone's decline became increasingly evident as neurosyphilis progressively eroded his mental faculties. he spent the last year of his sentence in the prison hospital, confused and disoriented. capone completed his term in alcatraz on january 6, 1939, and was transferred to the federal correctional institution at terminal island in california to serve out his sentence for contempt of court. he was paroled on november 16, 1939.
the main effect of capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of capone portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's organized crime syndicate. far from being smashed, the chicago outfit continued without being troubled by the chicago police, but at a lower level and without the open violence that had marked capone's rule. organized crime in the city had a lower profile once prohibition was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead "front boss". prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. in the late 1950s, fbi agents discovered an organization led by capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the chicago underworld.
after capone was released from prison, he was referred to johns hopkins hospital in baltimore for the treatment of paresis (caused by late-stage syphilis). hopkins refused to admit him based solely on his reputation, but union memorial hospital accepted him. capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two japanese weeping cherry trees to union memorial hospital in 1939. a very sickly capone left baltimore on march 20, 1940, after a few weeks inpatient and a few weeks outpatient, for palm island, florida.
in 1946, his physician and a baltimore psychiatrist performed examinations and concluded that capone had the mentality of a 12-year-old child. capone spent the last years of his life at his mansion in palm island, florida, spending time with his wife and grandchildren. on january 21, 1947, capone had a stroke. he regained consciousness and started to improve, but contracted bronchopneumonia. he suffered a cardiac arrest on january 22, and on january 25, surrounded by his family in his home, capone died after his heart failed as a result of apoplexy. he wаs originally buried at mount olivet cemetery in chicago. in 1950, capone's remains, along with those of his father and brother salvatore, were moved to mount carmel cemetery in hillside, illinois.
according to guy murchie jr. from the "chicago daily tribune", 33 people died as a consequence of al capone.
capone is one of the most notorious american gangsters of the 20th century and has been the major subject of numerous articles, books, and films. particularly, from 1925 to 1929, shortly after capone relocated to chicago, he enjoyed status as the most notorious mobster in the country. capone cultivated a certain image of himself in the media, that made him a subject of fascination. his personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal masterminds ever since his death. the stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted fedora is based on photos of capone. his accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and parodies of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.
capone has been portrayed on screen by:
actors playing characters based on capone include:

in electronics, the figures of merit of an amplifier are numerical measures that characterize its properties and performance. figures of merit can be given as a list of specifications that include properties such as gain, bandwidth, noise and linearity, among others listed in this article. figures of merit are important for determining the suitability of a particular amplifier for an intended use.
the gain of an amplifier is the ratio of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels. when measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: "g"(db)=10 log("p" /"p"). rf amplifiers are often specified in terms of the maximum "power gain" obtainable, while the voltage gain of audio amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers will be more often specified. for example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20 db will have a "voltage gain" of ten.
the use of voltage gain figure is appropriate when the amplifier's input impedance is much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance.
if two equivalent amplifiers are being compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings would be more sensitive as it would take less input signal to produce a given amount of power.
the bandwidth of an amplifier is the range of frequencies for which the amplifier gives "satisfactory performance". the definition of "satisfactory performance" may be different for different applications. however, a common and well-accepted metric is the half-power points (i.e. frequency where the power goes down by half its peak value) on the output vs. frequency curve. therefore, bandwidth can be defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. this is therefore also known as the bandwidth. bandwidths (otherwise called "frequency responses") for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted (, etc.) or "plus or minus 1db" (roughly the sound level difference people usually can detect).
the gain of a good quality full-range audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20 hz to about 20 khz (the range of normal human hearing). in ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have points < 10 hz and > . professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond ; too much of the amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of am radio interference would increase. modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and harmonics.
the range of frequency over which the gain is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its maximum gain is termed as bandwidth.
efficiency is a measure of how much of the power source is usefully applied to the amplifier's output. class a amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10–20% with a max efficiency of 25% for direct coupling of the output. inductive coupling of the output can raise their efficiency to a maximum of 50%.
drain efficiency is the ratio of output rf power to input dc power when primary input dc power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class a amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because rf signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input dc). manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. in this case the rf zero level is near the dc rail and will swing both above and below the rail during operation. while the voltage level is above the dc rail current is supplied by the inductor.
class b amplifiers have a very high efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (see: crossover distortion). in practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class ab design. modern class ab amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30–55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.
commercially available class d switching amplifiers have reported efficiencies as high as 90%. amplifiers of class c-f are usually known to be very high-efficiency amplifiers. rca manufactured an am broadcast transmitter employing a single class-c low-mu triode with an rf efficiency in the 90% range.
more efficient amplifiers run cooler, and often do not need any cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. the reason for this is that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. in more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.
in rf linear power amplifiers, such as cellular base stations and broadcast transmitters, special design techniques can be used to improve efficiency. doherty designs, which use a second output stage as a "peak" amplifier, can lift efficiency from the typical 15% up to 30-35% in a narrow bandwidth. envelope tracking designs are able to achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, by modulating the supply voltage to the amplifier in line with the envelope of the signal.
an ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits.
when the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in distortion.
in most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a "compression" effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. for these amplifiers, the 1 db compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1 db less than the small signal gain. sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.
ill effects of non-linearity can be reduced with negative feedback.
linearization is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as feed forward, predistortion, postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.
this is a measure of how much noise is introduced in the amplification process. noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. the metric for noise performance of a circuit is noise figure or noise factor. noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.
output dynamic range is the range, usually given in db, between the smallest and largest useful output levels. the lowest useful level is limited by output noise, while the largest is limited most often by distortion. the ratio of these two is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range. more precisely, if "s" = maximal allowed signal power and "n" = noise power, the dynamic range "dr" is "dr = (s + n ) /n".
in many switched mode amplifiers, dynamic range is limited by the minimum output step size.
slew rate is the maximum rate of change of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). many amplifiers are ultimately slew rate limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full power bandwidth to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.
the rise time, t, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a step input.
for a gaussian response system (or a simple rc roll off), the rise time is approximated by:
t * bw = 0.35, where t is rise time in seconds and bw is bandwidth in hz.
the time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the settling time, and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high-accuracy measurement systems. ringing refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output. ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an underdamped circuit.
in response to a step input, the overshoot is the amount the output exceeds its final, steady-state value.
stability is an issue in all amplifiers with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. it is especially an issue when applied over multiple amplifying stages.
stability is a major concern in rf and microwave amplifiers. the degree of an amplifier's stability can be quantified by a so-called stability factor. there are several different stability factors, such as the stern stability factor and the linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier in terms of its two-port parameters.

army of darkness (also known as bruce campbell vs. army of darkness) is a 1992 american dark fantasy comedy horror film directed and co-written by sam raimi, co-produced by robert tapert and bruce campbell and co-written by ivan raimi. starring campbell and embeth davidtz, it is the third installment in the "evil dead" franchise, and continuing from "evil dead ii", and follows ash williams (campbell) as he is trapped in the middle ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.
the film was produced as part of a production deal with universal pictures after the financial success of "darkman". filming took place in california in 1991. the makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: tony gardner and his company alterian, inc. were responsible for the makeup effects for ash and sheila, while kurtzman, nicotero & berger efx group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters. tom sullivan, who had previously worked on "within the woods", "the evil dead", and "evil dead ii", also contributed to the visual effects.
"army of darkness" premiered at the sitges film festival on october 9, 1992, and was released in the united states on february 19, 1993. it grossed $21.5 million total over its $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. since its video release, it has acquired a cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy. the film was dedicated to irvin shapiro, who died during the film's production in 1989.
after being transported to the middle ages, ash williams is captured by lord arthur's men, who suspect him of being an agent for duke henry, with whom arthur is at war. he is enslaved along with the captured henry, his gun and chainsaw are confiscated, and he is taken to a castle. ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a deadite and regains his weapons from arthur's wise man. after demanding that henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a deadite publicly, ash is celebrated as a hero. he grows attracted to sheila, the sister of one of arthur's fallen knights.
according to the wise man, the only way that ash can return to his time is through the magical "necronomicon ex-mortis." ash then starts his search for the "necronomicon". as he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues ash into a windmill, and he crashes into a mirror. small reflections of ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which ash kills and buries it.
when he arrives at the "necronomicon"s location, he finds three books instead of one and has to determine which is the actual book. attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely "klaatu barada nikto" he forgets and tries unsuccessfully to mumble and cough "nikto". he then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil clone resurrect, uniting into the army of darkness.
upon his return, ash demands to be returned to his own time. however, sheila is abducted by a flying deadite and later transformed into one. ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the army, and the people reluctantly agree. using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 oldsmobile delta 88 and enlisting the help of duke henry, ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the deadites and evil ash, saves sheila, and brings peace between arthur and henry. the wise men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.
back in the present, ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an s-mart department store. as he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving deadite, allowed to come to the present because ash again forgot the last word, attacks the customers. ash kills it using a winchester rifle from the sporting goods department and exclaims "hail to the king, baby" before passionately kissing the woman.
in the film's original ending, ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. as a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. universal pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.
plans to make a third "evil dead" film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of "darkman". "evil dead ii" made enough money internationally that dino de laurentiis was willing to finance a sequel. director and script writer sam raimi drew from a variety of sources, including literature with "a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court" and jonathan swift's "gulliver's travels" and films like "the 7th voyage of sinbad", "jason and the argonauts", the three stooges, and "conan the barbarian". "evil dead ii", according to bruce campbell, "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made". promotional drawings were created and published in "variety" during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. the working title for the project was "medieval dead", before it was later known as "evil dead iii: army of darkness". the title "army of darkness" came from an idea by irvin shapiro, during the production of "evil dead ii".
initially, raimi invited scott spiegel to co-write "army of darkness" because he had done a good job on "evil dead ii", but he was busy on rewrites for the clint eastwood film "the rookie". after the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called "easy wheels", sam and his brother ivan decided to co-write the film together. they worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of "darkman". after filming "darkman", they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. raimi says that ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script. campbell remembers, "we all decided, 'get him out of the cabin.' there were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' the three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting". campbell and tapert would read the script drafts, give raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.
the initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough. "darkman" was also a financial success and de laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with universal and so "army of darkness" became one of the films. the studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. however, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced campbell, raimi and producer robert tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. visual effects supervisor william mesa showed raimi storyboards he had from victor fleming's film "joan of arc" that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in "army of darkness". a storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the "joan of arc" storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.
traci lords was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "i didn't get the part but i clicked with bruce [campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the tv series "".
principal photography took place between soundstage and on-location work. "army of darkness" was filmed in bronson canyon and vasquez rocks natural area park. the interior shots were filmed on an introvision stage in hollywood. raimi's use of the introvision process was a tribute to the stop-motion animation work of ray harryhausen. introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional rear projection that harryhausen and others used. introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. to achieve this effect, raimi used 60-foot-tall scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates. according to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".
shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. it was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near acton, california on the edge of the mojave desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. it would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. money problems forced cinematographer bill pope to shoot only for certain hours monday through friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.
it was a difficult shoot for campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. mesa remembers, "bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for bruce as possible. 'make him go through torture!' so we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes". some scenes, like evil ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.
while dino de laurentiis gave raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, universal took over during post-production. universal was not happy with raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative. in this ending, the potion ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. a more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in malibu, california. then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in santa monica and involved ash in the windmill and the scenes with bridget fonda. raimi recalls, "actually, i kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".
raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with de laurentiis over the rights to the hannibal lecter character which universal needed so that they could film a sequel to "the silence of the lambs". the matter was finally resolved, but the release date for "army of darkness"' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to february 1993.
for the film's poster, universal brought campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. they showed him a rough of the frank frazetta-like painting. the actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. raimi ran into further troubles when the motion picture association of america gave it an nc-17 rating for a shot of a female deadite being killed early on in the film. universal wanted a pg-13 rating, so raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an r rating. in response, universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an r rating.
danny elfman, who composed the score for "darkman", wrote the "march of the dead" theme for "army of darkness". after the re-shoots were completed, joseph loduca, who composed the music for "the evil dead" and "evil dead ii", returned to score the film. the composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the seattle symphony. the score was released during the mondocon in austin, texas on october 3 and 4, 2015, on vinyl, over mondo records.
"army of darkness" was released by universal on february 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the united states, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend. in total, the film earned $11.5 million in the us.
the film currently holds a 72% "fresh" rating on the review aggregate website rotten tomatoes, based on 46 reviews, which made its critical reception above average but much lower than "the evil dead" and "evil dead ii", which received 96% and 98% respectively. on metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews". roger ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, "the movie isn't as funny or entertaining as "evil dead ii", however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled." in her review for "the new york times", janet maslin praised, "mr. campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook." desson howe, in this review for "the washington post" praised the film's style: "bill pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. the visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians william mesa, tony gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative." however, "entertainment weekly" gave the film a "c+" rating and wrote, "this spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland hollywood extras. by the time "army of darkness" turns into a retread of "jason and the argonauts", featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."
"army of darkness" won the saturn award for best horror film (1994). it was also nominated for best make-up. "army of darkness" was nominated for the grand prize at avoriaz fantastic film festival, and won the golden raven at the brussels international festival of fantasy film in 1993. the film also won the critics' award at fantasporto, and was nominated for the international fantasy film award in the category of best film in 1993. it was also nominated for best film at sitges, the spanish international film festival.
in march 2013, shortly before the release of "evil dead", a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, raimi confirmed that the next "evil dead" film will be "army of darkness 2". campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, ash. at a wondercon panel in march 2013, campbell and fede alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for alvarez's "evil dead 2" and raimi's "army of darkness 2" to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of ash and mia. on october 18, 2013, campbell once again confirmed in an interview with comicbook.com that he will be reprising his role as ash in the sequel. fede alvarez posted a status update on his twitter account that raimi will direct the sequel. campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.
in july 2014, campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a tv series with him as the star. the ten-episode season of "ash vs evil dead" premiered on starz on october 31, 2015, with the pilot co-written and directed by sam raimi. due to legal issues with universal, the events from "army of darkness" could not specifically be mentioned in the first season; it was later resolved and the events from that film were mentioned in the second season. in addition to campbell, the series stars dana delorenzo, ray santiago, and lucy lawless.
"army of darkness" had a comic book adaptation and several comic book sequels. the movie adaptation, from publisher dark horse comics, was actually published before the film's theatrical release.
eden studios, inc. published the "army of darkness roleplaying game" in 2005.

the rur-5 asroc (for "anti-submarine rocket") is an all-weather, all sea-conditions anti-submarine missile system. developed by the united states navy in the 1950s, it was deployed in the 1960s, updated in the 1990s, and eventually installed on over 200 usn surface ships, specifically cruisers, destroyers, and frigates. the asroc has been deployed on scores of warships of many other navies, including canada, germany, italy, japan, the republic of china, greece, pakistan and others.
asroc started development as the rocket assisted torpedo (rat) program by the naval ordnance test station at china lake in the early 1950s to develop a surface warship asw weapon counter to the new post-world war ii submarines which ran quieter, at much higher speed and could attack from much longer range with high speed homing torpedoes. in addition, the goal was to take advantage of modern sonars with a much larger detection range. an extended range torpedo delivered by parachute from the air would allow warships the stand-off capability to attack hostile submarines with very little advance notice to the hostile submarine. the rat program came in three phases: rat-a, rat-b and rat-c. rat-a (and its follow-on, rat-b) were efforts to develop a compact and economical stand-off asw for smaller warships, but were found to be either unreliable or had too short a range. rat-c was a program to develop a stand-off asw weapon that used a nuclear depth charge. this would require a range of at least 8,000 yards to escape potential damage from the underwater blast. unlike the original rat program rockets, the rat-c was considerably larger to accomplish the extended range needed and was to be fitted to larger warships. with the failure of both the rat-a and rat-b programs, rat-c was redesigned from a stand-off nuclear asw weapon to one that could use not only a nuclear depth charge but also a homing asw torpedo. to obtain the accuracy needed, the rat-c rocket launcher had to be redesigned with larger side fins. this program finally combined reliability and accuracy, along with the necessary stand-off range. however, before rat-c reached initial operational status in 1960 aboard the large us navy destroyer leader , its name was changed to the present asroc. asroc was first deployed in 1961 and eventually made the vast majority of usn surface combatants nuclear-capable.
the first asroc system using the mk-112 "matchbox" launcher was developed in the 1950s and installed in the 1960s. this system was phased out in the 1990s and replaced with the rum-139 vertical launch asroc, or "vla".
after a surface ship, patrol plane or anti-submarine helicopter detects an enemy submarine by using sonar or other sensors, it could relay the sub's position to an asroc-equipped ship for attack. the attacking ship would then fire an asroc missile carrying an acoustic homing torpedo or a w44 nuclear depth bomb onto an unguided ballistic trajectory toward the target. at a pre-determined point on the missile's trajectory, the payload separates from the missile and deploys a parachute to permit splashdown and water entry at a low speed and with minimum detectable noise. water entry activates the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, and homes in on the target using either active sonar or passive sonar.
the w44 nuclear depth charge entered service in 1961, but was never used beyond one or two tests before the limited nuclear test ban treaty banning underwater nuclear tests went into effect. a total of 575 weapons were produced. the w44 weighed with a diameter of and length of . following payload separation, the unguided w44 sank quickly to a predetermined depth where the 10-kiloton warhead detonated. the nuclear-armed asroc was never used in combat. w44-armed asroc missiles were retired by 1989, when all types of nuclear depth bombs were removed from deployment.
one of the first asroc installations was on in 1960. the first large group of ships to receive asroc were 78 s, modified under the fleet rehabilitation and modernization mark i program (fram i) in the early 1960s. a mark 112 8-tube asroc launcher was added along with other major modifications. asroc reloads were stowed alongside the helicopter hangar and handled by a small crane.
the 31 u.s. navy s were all built with the mark 16 mod 7 asroc launching group and mk 4 asroc weapons handling system (awhs) reload system. these had one standard mark 112 octuple asroc launcher, located immediately above a reload system holding an additional 16 assembled rounds (two complete reloads of eight missiles apiece). thus, each "spruance"-class destroyer originally carried a maximum total of 24 asroc.
most other us navy and allied navy destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates, and several different classes of cruisers only carried the one asroc "matchbox" mk 112 launcher with eight asroc missiles (although later in service, some of those missiles could be replaced by the harpoon anti-ship missile). the "matchbox" mk 112 launchers were capable of carrying a mixture of the two types. reloads were carried in many classes, either on first level of the superstructure immediately abaft the launcher, or in a separate deckhouse just forward or abaft the mk 112.
the mk 16 launching group also had configurations that supported rgm-84 harpoon (onboard destroyer escorts (frigates)) or a variation of the tartar missile in limited distribution.
ships with the mk 26 gmls, and late marks of the mk 10 gmls aboard the s, could accommodate asroc in these power-loaded launchers (the mk 13 gmls was not able to fire the weapon, as the launcher rail was too short).
most "spruance"-class destroyers were later modified to include the mk 41 vls, these launchers are capable of carrying a mixture of the rum-139 vl-asroc, the tomahawk tlam, and other missiles. all of the "spruance" destroyers carried two separate quad harpoon launchers. other us ships with the mk 41 can also accommodate vl-asroc.

ahmed bin abdullah al-nami (arabic: أحمد بن عبد الله النعمي, ; also transliterated as alnami; august 17, 1977 – september 11, 2001) was one of four hijackers of united airlines flight 93 as part of the september 11 attacks.
born in saudi arabia, nami had served as a muezzin and was a college student. he left his family in 2000 to complete the hajj, but later went to afghanistan bound for an al-qaeda training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.
he arrived in the united states in may 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in florida up until the attacks on september 11, 2001, nami boarded united 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural shanksville, pennsylvania, after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the world trade center and the pentagon.
nami, much like abdulaziz al-omari, wail al-shehri, waleed al-shehri and mohand al-shehri, was born in the 'asir province in saudi arabia. born to the quraish tribe of saudi arabia, nami served as a muezzin at the seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. that autumn he left his family home in khamis mushayt in the summer of 2000 to complete the hajj, but never returned – instead travelling to the al farouq training camp in afghanistan where he met and befriended waleed and wail al-shehri, two brothers from khamis mushayt, and saeed al-ghamdi. the four reportedly pledged themselves to jihad in the spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by wail – who had dubbed himself "abu mossaeb al-janubi" after one of muhammad's companions. dubbed "abu hashim", nami was considered "gentle in manner" by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a mare along with muhammad, and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.
during his time at al-farooq, there is a curious mention under mushabib al-hamlan's details that nami had recently had laser eye surgery, an uncited fact that does not reappear.
by october he had taken a prospective hijacker mushabib al-hamlan from afghanistan to saudi arabia where they both procured b-1/b-2 tourist/business visas on october 28 – but hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as "student" but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the united states merely as los angeles – in the end he never used this visa to enter the united states, and reported his passport (c115007, which showed evidence of travel to afghanistan) as "lost", and procured a new one from jeddah (c505363). he used the new passport to acquire a new b-1/b-2 visa in jeddah on april 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa. he was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application. records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that nami had successfully received an earlier visa.
in mid-november 2000, the 9/11 commission believes that nami, wail and waleed al-shehri, all of whom had obtained their u.s. visas in late october, traveled in a group from saudi arabia to beirut and then onward to iran where they could travel through to afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. this probably followed their return to saudi arabia to get "clean" passports. an associate of a senior hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.
while in the united arab emirates, nami purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by mustafa al-hawsawi. five other hijackers also passed through the uae and purchased travellers cheques, including majed moqed, saeed al-ghamdi, hamza al-ghamdi, ahmed al-haznawi and wail al-shehri.
in march 2001, ahmed al-nami appeared in an al-qaeda farewell video showing 13 of the "muscle hijackers" before they left their training centre in kandahar; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.
on april 23, nami was recorded obtaining a new us visa.
on may 28, nami arrived in the united states from dubai with fellow-hijackers mohand al-shehri and hamza al-ghamdi. by early june, nami was living in apartment 1504 at the delray racquet club condominiums with saeed al-ghamdi in delray beach, florida. he telephoned his family in 'asir shortly after arriving in the country.
in june, he phoned his family for the last time.
he was one of 9 hijackers to open a suntrust bank account with a cash deposit around june 2001, and on june 29 received either a florida state identification card or drivers license.
he may have been one of three hijackers that listed the naval air station in pensacola, florida as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the delray condominium.
on august 28, nami and ahmed al-haznawi reportedly bothered a delray beach resident, maria siscar simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.
on september 5, nami and saeed al-ghamdi purchased tickets for a september 7 flight to newark at mile high travel on commercial boulevard—paying cash for their tickets. ziad jarrah and ahmed al-haznawi also purchased tickets for the same flight from passage tours.
on september 7, all four flight 93 hijackers flew from fort lauderdale to newark international airport aboard spirit airlines.
on september 11, 2001, nami arrived in newark to board united airlines flight 93 along with saeed al-ghamdi, ahmed al-haznawi and ziad jarrah. some reports suggest haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of cctv cameras at the time has compounded the problem. nami boarded the plane between 7:39 am and 7:48 am; seated in first class 3c, next to saeed al-ghamdi.
due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.
at least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the egyptian islamic jihad. the calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.
passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. the hijackers crashed the plane into the pennsylvanian countryside rather than cede control of the plane. all aboard died.
after the attacks, an employee of saudi arabian airlines named ahmed al-nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.
he has been portrayed by british actor jamie harding in the 2006 film "united 93" and asim wali in the film "flight 93".

ahmed ibrahim al-haznawi (, ) (october 11, 1980 – september 11, 2001) was one of four hijackers of united airlines flight 93 as part of the september 11 attacks.
he left his family to fight in chechnya in 2000 but was probably sent to training camps in afghanistan. it was there he was chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks. he arrived in the united states in june 2001 under the direction of al-qaeda for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa. once he was in the u.s., he settled in florida and helped plan out how the attacks would take place.
on september 11, 2001, haznawi boarded united airlines flight 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in shanksville, pennsylvania, after a passenger uprising.
ahmed al-haznawi was the son of a saudi imam from the al-bahah province, a province in the south west of saudi arabia. haznawi grew up in the village of hazna, where his father was a cleric at the mosque in the central marketplace section of the village. haznawi belonged to a family that was part of the larger, al-ghamdi tribe, sharing the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers saeed al-ghamdi, hamza al-ghamdi, and ahmed al-ghamdi. he memorised the quran, giving him the title hafiz.
this group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met one another some time in 1999.
haznawi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to fight in chechnya, although his father forbade him. his father and brother, abdul rahman al-haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to training in afghanistan.
on november 12, 2000, haznawi applied for and received a two-year u.s. b-1/b-2
(tourist/business) visa in jeddah, saudi arabia.
from november 27, 2000, through december 27, 2000, haznawi was in saudi arabia for ramadan. it is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told saeed and hamza al-ghamdi about the operation.
some time late in 2000, haznawi traveled to the united arab emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by mustafa al-hawsawi. five other hijackers also passed through the uae and purchased travellers cheques, including majed moqed, saeed al-ghamdi, hamza al-ghamdi, wail al-shehri and ahmed al-nami.
he was one of four hijackers believed to be staying at a kandahar guest house in march 2001, where they were seen by mohammed jabarah. jabarah remembered haznawi specifically, saying that he was "very devout and could recite the entire koran from memory."
on june 8, he arrived in miami, florida, with fellow hijacker wail al-shehri. he was one of 9 hijackers to open a suntrust bank account with a cash deposit around june 2001. he is believed to have moved in with ziad jarrah, who got a new apartment on bougainvilla dr. in lauderdale-by-the-sea, after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their german passports, which he later turned over to the fbi.
on june 25, jarrah took haznawi to holy cross hospital in fort lauderdale on advice of his landlord charles lisa. haznawi was treated by dr. christos tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf. while he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase, the media briefly reported it as a sign of cutaneous anthrax and a possible link to the 2001 anthrax attacks, although fbi later addressed the rumors stating that "exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been."
on july 10, haznawi obtained a florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on september 7, 2001, by filling out a change-of-address form. five other hijackers also received duplicate florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses from different states. some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.
jarrah and haznawi both received their one-way tickets for united airlines flight 93, on september 5. on september 7, all four flight 93 hijackers flew from fort lauderdale to newark international airport aboard spirit airlines.
on september 11, 2001, haznawi arrived at newark international airport to board flight 93. although he was selected for additional security by capps and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident, with only his checked bags requiring extra screening for explosives.
due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert. within minutes, flight 93 was hijacked as well.
at least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some believe may have signified an allegiance to the egyptian islamic jihad. the calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside – it is not known which hijacker this was. some passengers expressed doubt that the bomb was real.
passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. a passenger uprising soon took place. hijacker-pilot, ziad jarrah, crashed the plane into an empty field near shanksville, pennsylvania, in order to prevent the passengers from gaining control of the plane. the crash killed everyone on board.
after the attacks, before the release of the fbi pictures of the hijackers, arab news reported that haznawi's brother abdul rahman had told al-madinah newspaper that a photograph published by local newspapers bore no resemblance to his brother.
a videotape titled "the wills of the new york and washington battle martyrs" was aired on al jazeera on april 16, 2002. while the name beneath the speaker read "al-ghamdi", the image is of haznawi speaking. officials suggested that the name was merely a reference to his tribal affiliation. the film was thought to have been made in march 2001. in it, he talked about his plans to bring the "bloodied message" to america. in september 2002, a similar tape made by abdulaziz al-omari appeared.
he has been portrayed by actors omar berdouni in "united 93", and zak santiago in "flight 93".

athanasius of alexandria (; , ; ; c. 296–298 – 2 may 373), also called athanasius the great, athanasius the confessor or, primarily in the coptic orthodox church, athanasius the apostolic, was the 20th bishop of alexandria (as athanasius i). his intermittent episcopacy spanned 45 years (c. 8 june 328 – 2 may 373), of which over 17 encompassed five exiles, when he was replaced on the order of four different roman emperors. athanasius was a christian theologian, a church father, the chief defender of trinitarianism against arianism, and a noted egyptian leader of the fourth century.
conflict with arius and arianism as well as successive roman emperors shaped athanasius' career. in 325, at the age of 27, athanasius began his leading role against the arians as a deacon and assistant to bishop alexander of alexandria during the first council of nicaea. roman emperor constantine the great had convened the council in may–august 325 to address the arian position that the son of god, jesus of nazareth, is of a distinct substance from the father. three years after that council, athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of alexandria. in addition to the conflict with the arians (including powerful and influential arian churchmen led by eusebius of nicomedia), he struggled against the emperors constantine, constantius ii, julian the apostate and valens. he was known as athanasius contra mundum (latin for "athanasius against the world").
nonetheless, within a few years after his death, gregory of nazianzus called him the "pillar of the church". his writings were well regarded by all following church fathers in the west and the east, who noted their rich devotion to the word-become-man, great pastoral concern and profound interest in monasticism. athanasius is counted as one of the four great eastern doctors of the church in the catholic church. in the eastern orthodox church, he is labeled as the "father of orthodoxy". athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the new testament that are in use today. he is venerated as a christian saint, whose feast day is 2 may in western christianity, 15 may in the coptic orthodox church, and 18 january in the other eastern orthodox churches. he is venerated by the oriental and eastern orthodox churches, the catholic church, the lutheran churches, and the anglican communion.
the council of nicaea (325), "passed twenty disciplinary canons for the better government of the church. by one, c. 6, of these the bishops of rome, alexandria, and antioch, were declared to possess jurisdiction over the churches in their respective provinces". hence, the alexandrian bishop was declared with the authority of patriarch.
athanasius was born to a christian family in the city of alexandria or possibly the nearby nile delta town of damanhur sometime between the years 293 and 298. the earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises "contra gentes" ("against the heathens") and "de incarnatione" ("on the incarnation"), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of arianism.
however cornelius clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the maximian persecution of 303, which he suggests athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. secondly, the "festal epistles" state that the arians had accused athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as patriarch of alexandria in 328. the accusation must have seemed plausible. the orthodox church places his year of birth around 297.
his parents were wealthy enough to afford giving him a fine secular education. he was, nevertheless, clearly not a member of the egyptian aristocracy. some western scholars consider his command of greek, in which he wrote most (if not all) of his surviving works, evidence that he may have been a greek born in alexandria. historical evidence, however, indicates that he was fluent in coptic as well given the regions of egypt where he preached. some surviving copies of his writings are in fact in coptic, though scholars differ as to whether he himself wrote them in coptic originally (which would make him the first patriarch to do so), or whether these were translations of writings originally in greek.
rufinus relates a story that as bishop alexander stood by a window, he watched boys playing on the seashore below, imitating the ritual of christian baptism. he sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys (athanasius) had acted as bishop. after questioning athanasius, bishop alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the form and matter of the sacrament had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly catechized. he invited athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers.
alexandria was the most important trade center in the whole empire during athanasius's boyhood. intellectually, morally, and politically—it epitomized the ethnically diverse graeco-roman world, even more than rome or constantinople, antioch or marseilles. its famous catechetical school, while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of pantaenus, clement of alexandria, origen of alexandria, dionysius and theognostus, had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests, and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors.
peter of alexandria, the 17th archbishop of alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of the persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. his successor as bishop of alexandria was alexander of alexandria (312–328). according to sozomen; "the bishop alexander 'invited athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. he had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen' ".(soz., ii, xvii)
athanasius' earliest work, "against the heathen – on the incarnation" (written before 319), bears traces of origenist alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting plato and using a definition from aristotle's "organon") but in an orthodox way. athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of neo-platonism. ultimately, athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the school of alexandria away from the origenist principles such as the "entirely allegorical interpretation of the text". still, in later works, athanasius quotes homer more than once ("hist. ar. 68, orat. iv. 29"). in his letter to emperor constantius, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of demosthenes "de corona".
athanasius knew greek and admitted not knowing hebrew [see, e.g., the 39th festal letter of st. athan.]. the old testament passages he quotes frequently come from the septuagint greek translation. only rarely did he use other greek versions (to aquila once in the "ecthesis", to other versions once or twice on the psalms), and his knowledge of the old testament was limited to the septuagint. the combination of scriptural study and of greek learning was characteristic of the famous alexandrian school.
bishop (or patriarch, the highest ecclesial rank in the centre of the church, in alexandria) alexander ordained athanasius a deacon in 319. in 325, athanasius served as alexander's secretary at the first council of nicaea. already a recognized theologian and ascetic, he was the obvious choice to replace his aging mentor alexander as the patriarch of alexandria, despite the opposition of the followers of arius and meletius of lycopolis.
at length, in the council of nicaea, the term "consubstantial" (homoṏusion) was suggested by athanasius: it was immediately adopted, and a formulary of faith embodying it was drawn up by hosius of córdoba. from this time to the end of the arian controversies the word "consubstantial" continued to be the test of catholic orthodoxy. the formulary of faith drawn up by hosius is known as the nicene creed. however, "he was not the originator of the famous 'homoṏusion'. the term had been proposed in a non-obvious and illegitimate sense by paul of samosata to the fathers at antioch, and had been rejected by them as savouring of materialistic conceptions of the godhead."
while still a deacon under alexander's care (or early in his patriarchate as discussed below) athanasius may have also become acquainted with some of the solitaries of the egyptian desert, and in particular anthony the great, whose life he is said to have written.
in about 319, when athanasius was a deacon, a presbyter named arius came into a direct conflict with alexander of alexandria. it appears that arius reproached alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop. arius' theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in alexandrian christianity. he embraced a subordinationist christology which taught that christ was the divine son (logos) of god, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by alexandrian thinkers like origen, and which was a common christological view in alexandria at the time. arius had support from a powerful bishop named eusebius of nicomedia (not to be confused with eusebius of caesarea), illustrating how arius's subordinationist christology was shared by other christians in the empire. arius was subsequently excommunicated by alexander, and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position.
frances a. m. forbes writes that when the patriarch alexander was on his death-bed he called athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop. "when the bishops of the church assembled to elect their new patriarch, the whole catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to heaven and crying; "give us athanasius!" the bishops had nothing better. athanasius was thus elected, as gregory tells us..." (pope gregory i, would have full access to the vatican archives).
t. gilmartin, (professor of history, maynooth, 1890), writes in church history, vol. 1, ch xvii: "on the death of alexander, five months after the termination of the council of nicaea, athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. he was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. the clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, patriarch of alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. he at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age."
athanasius' episcopate began on 9 may 328 as the alexandrian council elected athanasius to succeed after the death of alexander, and was consecrated in a.d. 326." . patriarch athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different roman emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which athanasius fled alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life.
during his first years as bishop, athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of egypt and libya. he established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years.
"during the forty-eight years of his episcopate, his history is told in the history of the controversies in which he was constantly engaged with the arians, and of the sufferings he had to endure in defence of the nicene faith.
we have seen that when arius was allowed to return from exile in 328, athanasius refused to remove the sentence of excommunication."
athanasius' first problem lay with meletius of lycopolis and his followers, who had failed to abide by the first council of nicaea. that council also anathematized arius. accused of mistreating arians and meletians, athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops in tyre, the first synod of tyre, in 335. there, eusebius of nicomedia and other supporters of arius deposed athanasius. on 6 november, both sides of the dispute met with emperor constantine i in constantinople. at that meeting, the arians claimed athanasius would try to cut off essential egyptian grain supplies to constantinople. he was found guilty, and sent into exile to augusta treverorum in gaul (now trier in germany).
when athanasius reached his destination in exile in 336, maximinus of trier received him, but not as a disgraced person. athanasius stayed with him for two years. paul i of constantinople, who was banished by the emperor constantius, also stayed with him. maximinus cautioned the emperor constans against the arians, revealing their plots.
when emperor constantine i died, athanasius was allowed to return to his see of alexandria. shortly thereafter, however, constantine's son, the new roman emperor constantius ii, renewed the order for athanasius's banishment in 338. 'within a few weeks he set out for rome to lay his case before the church at large. he had made his appeal to pope julius, who took up his cause with whole-heartedness that never wavered down to the day of that holy pontiff's death. the pope summoned a synod of bishops to meet in rome. after a careful and detailed examination of the entire case, the primate's innocence was proclaimed to the christian world.' . during this time, gregory of cappadocia was installed as the patriarch of alexandria, usurping the absent athanasius. athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual "festal letters", in which he also announced on which date easter would be celebrated that year.
in 339 or 340, nearly one hundred bishops met at alexandria, declared in favor of athanasius, and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the eusebian faction at tyre. plus, pope julius i wrote to the supporters of arius strongly urging athanasius's reinstatement, but that effort proved in vain. pope julius i called a synod in rome in 340 to address the matter, which proclaimed athanasius the rightful bishop of alexandria.
early in the year 343 we find athanasius had travelled, via rome, from alexandria, north africa, to gaul; nowadays belgium / holland and surrounding areas, where hosius of córdoba was bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the west. together they set out for serdica, sofia. a full council of the church was convened / summoned there in deference to the roman pontiff's wishes. the travel was a mammoth task in itself. at this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the church, the case of athanasius was taken up once more, that is, athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called arsenius and using his body for magic – an absurd charge. they even produced arsenius' severed hand.).
the council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the semi-arian synod of antioch (341), and went into exile. it was called according to socrates, (e. h. ii. 20) by the two emperors, constans and constantius; but, according to baronius by pope julius (337–352), (ad an. 343). one hundred and seventy six attended. eusebian bishops objected to the admission of athanasius and other deposed bishops to the council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. the eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to philoppopolis in thrace, philippopolis (thracia), where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the patriarch of antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the synod of antioch.
athanasius' innocence was reaffirmed at the council of serdica. two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of alexandria, the other to the bishops of egypt and libya, in which the will of the council was made known. meanwhile, the eusebian party had gone to philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against athanasius and his supporters. the persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. orders were given that if the saint attempt to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from serdica to naissus in mysia, where he celebrated the easter festival of the year 344. it was hosius who presided over the council of serdica, as he did for the first council of nicaea, which like the 341 synod, found athanasius innocent. &. he celebrated his last easter in exile in aquileia in april 345, received by bishop fortunatianus.
eastern bishop gregory of cappadocia died, probably of violence in june of 345. (gregory, an arian bishop, had taken over the see of alexandria.) the emissary to the emperor constantius sent by the bishops of the council of serdica to report the finding of the council, who had been met at first with most insulting treatment, now received a favourable hearing. constantius was forced to reconsider his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield. but three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of athanasius. he passed rapidly from aquileia to treves, from treves to rome and from rome by way of the northern route to adrianople, edirne, and antioch, ankara, where he met constantius. he was accorded a gracious interview by the emperor, and sent back to his see in triumph, and began his memorable ten years of peace, which lasted to the third exile, 356.
pope julius died in april 352, and was succeeded by liberius. for two years liberius had been favourable to the cause of athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great nicene text, the "homoousion", had been studiously omitted. in 355 a council was held at milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the western bishops, a fourth condemnation of athanasius was announced to the world. with his friends scattered, the saintly hosius in exile, and pope liberius denounced as acquiescing in arian formularies, athanasius could hardly hope to escape. on the night of 8 february 356, while engaged in services in the church of st. thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest. it was the beginning of his third exile.
t. gilmartin, (professor of history, maynooth, 1890), writes in church history, vol. 1, ch xvii: by constantius' order, the sole ruler of the roman empire at the death of his brother constans, the council of arles in 353, was held, which was presided over by vincent, bishop of capua, in the name of pope liberius. the fathers terrified of the threats of the emperor, an avowed arian, they consented to the condemnation of athanasius. the pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the emperor to hold another council, in which the charges against athanasius could be freely investigated. to this constantius consented, for he felt able to control the council in milan.
three hundred bishops assembled in milan, most from the west, only a few from the east, in 355. they met in the church of milan. shortly, the emperor ordered them to a hall in the imperial palace, thus ending any free debate. he presented an arian formula of faith for their acceptance. he threatened any who refused with exile and death. all, with the exception of dionysius (bishop of milan), and the two papal legates, viz., eusebius of vercelli and lucifer of cagliari, consented to the arian creed and the condemnation of athanasius. those who refused were sent into exile. the decrees were forwarded to the pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.
through the influence of the eusebian faction at constantinople, an arian bishop, george of cappadocia, was now appointed to rule the see of alexandria. athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of upper egypt, where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; "apology to constantius", the "apology for his flight", the "letter to the monks", and the "history of the arians".
constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the arians, banished athanasius from alexandria once again. this was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest athanasius during a vigil service. athanasius fled to upper egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. during this period, athanasius completed his work "four orations against the arians" and defended his own recent conduct in the "apology to constantius" and "apology for his flight". constantius' persistence in his opposition to athanasius, combined with reports athanasius received about the persecution of non-arians by the new arian bishop george of laodicea, prompted athanasius to write his more emotional "history of the arians", in which he described constantius as a precursor of the antichrist.
constantius ordered liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply. he was ordered into banishment to beroea, in thrace. he sent expensive presents if he were to accept the arian position, which liberius refused. he sent him five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" which liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in christ, and not to persecute the church of god. attempts were made to leave the presents in the church, but liberius threw them out. constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to milan, where in a conference recorded by theodore, he boldly told constantius that athanasius had been acquitted at serdica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. the emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.
liberius went into exile. constantius, after two years went to rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. the ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore liberius. he assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. he subscribed the condemnation of athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the arians at sirmium. and he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the creed of niceae, as theodoret testifies. (theodoret, hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). the emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. so did the bishops at his court. athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. constantius was an avowed arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, constans.
t. gilmartin, (professor of history, maynooth, 1890), writes in church history, vol. 1, ch xvii:
the arians sought the approval of an ecumenical council. they sought to hold two councils. constantius, summoned the bishops of the east to meet at seleucia in isauria, and those of the west to rimini in italy. a preliminary conference was held by the arians at sirmium, to agree a formula of faith. a "homoeon" creed was adopted, declaring the son to be "like the father". the two met in autumn of 359. at seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-arian. the semi-arians refused to accept anything less than the "homoiousion", (see: homoiousian), formulary of faith. the imperial prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.
acacius, the leader of the "homoean" party went to constantinople, where the sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the "home synod", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-arians. at rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were arian, the rest were orthodox. the orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the sirmian. each party sent a deputation to the emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. for the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (sulpitius severius says), constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the sirmian creed. it was after this council that jerome said: " ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself arian."
the arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. the emperor constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died on 4 november 361 and was succeeded by julian. the proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant arian faction in alexandria. george, the usurping bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. an obscure presbyter of the name of pistus was immediately chosen by the arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. an edict had been put forth by julian permitting the exiled bishops of the "galileans" to return to their "towns and provinces". athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 february 362.
in 362 he convened a council at alexandria, and presided over it with eusebius of vercelli. athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. this prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the trinity. however, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the holy spirit, the human soul of christ, and christ's divinity. mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.
with characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty. to clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the nicene formularies. in the meanwhile, julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that athanasius was exercising at alexandria, addressed an order to ecdicius, the prefect of egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. the edict was communicated to the bishop by pythicodorus trico, who, though described in the "chronicon athanasianum" (xxxv) as a "philosopher", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. on 23 october the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.
in 362, the new emperor julian, noted for his opposition to christianity, ordered athanasius to leave alexandria once again. athanasius left for upper egypt, remaining there with the desert fathers until julian's death on 26 june 363. athanasius returned in secret to alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, jovian, reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions.
his first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the nicene creed. early in september 363 he set out for antioch on the orontes, bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied. at antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith. the following february jovian died; and in october, 364, athanasius was once more an exile.
two years later, the emperor valens, who favored the arian position, in his turn exiled athanasius. this time athanasius simply left for the outskirts of alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced valens to retract his order of exile. some early reports state that athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb in a christian cemetery. it was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb. (soz., "hist. eccl.", vi, xii; soc., "hist. eccl.", iv, xii).
the accession of valens gave a fresh lease of life to the arian party. he issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by constantius, but who had been permitted by jovian to return to their sees. the news created the greatest consternation in the city of alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of athanasius would be laid before the emperor. but athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him. he quietly withdrew from alexandria, 5 october, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing athanasius to return to his episcopal see.
in 366 pope liberius died and was succeeded by pope damasus, a man of strong character and holy life. two years later, in a council of the church, it was decreed that no bishop should be consecrated unless he held the creed of nicea. (f. a. forbes).
after returning to alexandria in early 366, athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. he resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the incarnation which had been defined at nicaea. on 2 may 373, having consecrated peter ii, one of his presbyters as his successor, athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.
in coptic literature, athanasius is the first patriarch of alexandria to use coptic as well as greek in his writings.
athanasius was not a speculative theologian. as he stated in his "first letters to serapion", he held on to "the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers." he held that not only was the son of god consubstantial with the father, but so was the holy spirit, which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the trinity.
athanasius' ""letter concerning the decrees of the council of nicaea"" ("de decretis"), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter from 367 is the first known listing of all those books now accepted as the new testament. (earlier similar lists vary by the omission or addition of a few books.)
examples of athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include "orations against the arians", his defence of the divinity of the holy spirit ("letters to serapion" in the 360s, and "on the holy spirit"), against macedonianism and "on the incarnation".
athanasius also wrote a two-part "against the heathen" and "the incarnation of the word of god". completed probably early in his life, before the arian controversy, they constitute the first classic work of developed orthodox theology. in the first part, athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. the second part presents teachings on the redemption. also in these books, athanasius put forward the belief, referencing , that the son of god, the eternal word (logos) through whom god created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.
his other important works include his "letters to serapion", which defends the divinity of the holy spirit. in a letter to epictetus of corinth, athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of christ. another of his letters, to dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.
athanasius also wrote several works of biblical exegesis, primarily on old testament materials. the most important of these is his "epistle to marcellinus" (pg 27:12–45) on how to incorporate psalm saying into one's spiritual practice. excerpts remain of his discussions concerning the book of genesis, the song of solomon, and psalms.
perhaps his most notable letter was his festal letter, written to his church in alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence. this letter clearly shows his stand that accepting jesus as the divine son of god is not optional but necessary:
his biography of anthony the great entitled "life of antony"(βίος καὶ πολιτεία πατρὸς ἀντωνίου, "vita antonii") became his most widely read work. translated into several languages, it became something of a best seller in its day and played an important role in the spreading of the ascetic ideal in eastern and western christianity. it depicted anthony as an illiterate yet holy man who continuously engaged in spiritual exercises in the egyptian desert and struggled against demonic powers. it later served as an inspiration to christian monastics in both the east and the west.
athanasius' works on ascetism also include a "discourse on virginity", a short work on "love and self-control", and a treatise "on sickness and health" (of which only fragments remain).
there are several other works ascribed to him, although not necessarily generally accepted as being his own. these include the so-called athanasian creed (which is today generally seen as being of 5th-century galician origin), and a complete "expositions on the psalms" (pg 27: 60–545).
athanasius was originally buried in alexandria, egypt, but his remains were later transferred to the chiesa di san zaccaria in venice, italy. during pope shenouda iii's visit to rome from 4 to 10 may 1973, pope paul vi gave the coptic patriarch a relic of athanasius, which he brought back to egypt on 15 may. the relic is currently preserved under the new saint mark's coptic orthodox cathedral in cairo, egypt. however, the majority of athanasius's corpse remains in the venetian church.
all major christian denominations which officially recognize saints venerate athanasius. western christians observe his feast day on 2 may, the anniversary of his death. the catholic church considers athanasius a doctor of the church. for coptic christians, his feast day is pashons 7 (now circa 15 may). eastern orthodox liturgical calendars remember athanasius on 18 january.
gregory of nazianzus (330–390, also a doctor of the church), said: "when i praise athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for i name every virtue as often as i mention him who was possessed of all virtues. he was the true pillar of the church. his life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith."
historian cornelius clifford said in his account: "athanasius was the greatest champion of catholic belief on the subject of the incarnation that the church has ever known and in his lifetime earned the characteristic title of "father of orthodoxy", by which he has been distinguished ever since."
bl. john henry newman described him as a "principal instrument, after the apostles, by which the sacred truths of christianity have been conveyed and secured to the world". [letters..]
historian cornelius clifford says: "his career almost personifies a crisis in the history of christianity; and he may be said rather to have shaped the events in which he took part than to have been shaped by them."
the greater majority of church leaders and the emperors fell into support for arianism, so much so that jerome, 340–420, wrote of the period: "the whole world groaned and was amazed to find itself arian". he, athanasius, even suffered an unjust excommunication from pope liberius (325–366) who was exiled and leant towards compromise, until he was allowed back to the see of rome. athanasius stood virtually alone against the world. (..see: "third exile", above.)
it was the custom of the bishops of alexandria to circulate a letter after epiphany each year establishing the date of easter, and therefore other moveable feasts. they also took the occasion to discuss other matters. athanasius wrote forty-five festal letters. athanasius' "39th festal letter", written in 367, is widely regarded as a milestone in the evolution of the canon of new testament books.
athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the new testament that are in use today. up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. athanasius compiled the list to resolve questions about such texts as "the epistle of barnabas". athanasius includes the book of baruch and the letter of jeremiah and places the book of esther among the "7 books not in the canon but to be read" along with the wisdom of solomon, sirach (ecclesiasticus), judith, tobit, the didache, and the shepherd of hermas.
athanasius' list is similar to the codex vaticanus in the vatican library, probably written in rome, in 340 by alexandrian scribes for emperor constans, during the period of athanasius' seven-year exile in the city. the establishment of the canon was not a unilateral decision by a bishop in alexandria, but the result of a process of careful investigation and deliberation, as documented in a codex of the greek bible and, twenty-seven years later, in his festal letter.
pope damasus i, the bishop of rome in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a new testament canon identical to that of athanasius. a synod in hippo in 393 repeated athanasius' and damasus' new testament list (without the epistle to the hebrews), and the council of carthage (397) repeated athanasius' and damasus' complete new testament list.
scholars debate whether athanasius' list in 367 formed the basis for later lists. because athanasius' canon is the closest canon of any of the church fathers to the one used by protestant churches today, many protestants point to athanasius as the father of the canon.
in the light of mother f. a. forbes' research and reference to pope saint gregory's writings, it would appear that athanasius was constrained to be bishop: she writes that when the patriarch alexander was on his death-bed he called athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop. "when the bishops of the church assembled to elect their new patriarch, the whole catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to heaven and crying; "give us athanasius!" the bishops had nothing better. athanasius was thus elected, as gregory tells us..." (pope gregory i, would have full access to the vatican archives).
alban butler, writes on the subject: "five months after this great council, nicae, st alexander lying on his death-bed, recommended to his clergy and people the choice of athanasius for his successor, thrice repeating his name. in consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all egypt assembled at alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326. he seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age."
christian denominations worldwide revere athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. they cite his defense of the christology described in the first chapter of the gospel of st. john and his significant theological works (c. s. lewis calls "on the incarnation of the word of god" a "masterpiece") as evidence of his righteousness. they also emphasize his close relationship with anthony the great, the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the christian monastic movement.
the gospel of st. john and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the divinity of jesus. this gospel in itself is the greatest support of athanasius' stand. the gospel of st. john's first chapter began to be said at the end of mass, we believe as a result of athanasius, and his life's stand, but quietly, and was later - together with some other originally private devotions - absorbed by the liturgical service proper as so-called "last gospel". the beginning of john's gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the middle ages; the practice of saying it at the altar grew, and eventually pius v made this practice universal for the roman rite in his edition of the missal (1570). it became a firm custom with exceptions in using an other gospel in use from 1920.
gregory of nazianzus (330–390) begins or. 21 with: "when i praise athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for i name every virtue as often as i mention him who was possessed of all virtues. he was the true pillar of the church. his life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith."
cyril of alexandria (370–444) in the first letter says: "athanasius is one who can be trusted: he would not say anything that is not in accord with sacred scripture." (ep 1).
many modern historians point out that such a hostile attitude towards athanasius is based on an unfair judgment of historical sources.
saint pope pius x said in a letter to philosopher-friend and correspondent in the closing years of his life, (epist. lxxi, ad max.): "let what was confessed by the fathers of nicaea prevail".
throughout most of his career, athanasius had many detractors. classics scholar timothy barnes recounts ancient allegations against athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. athanasius used "arian" to describe both followers of arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for christians who disagreed with his formulation of the trinity. athanasius called many of his opponents "arian", except for meletius (miletus).
scholars now believe that the arian party was not monolithic, but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early christian theological spectrum. they supported the tenets of origenist thought and subordinationist theology, but had little else in common. moreover, many labelled "arian" did not consider themselves followers of arius. in addition, non-homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of arius, since arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops.
the old allegations continue to be made against athanasius however many centuries later. for example, richard e. rubenstein suggests that athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in alexandria under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.

the azores ( , ; ), officially the autonomous region of the azores (), is one of the two autonomous regions of portugal (along with madeira). it is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the north atlantic ocean about west of continental portugal, about west of lisbon, in continental portugal, about northwest of morocco, and about southeast of newfoundland, canada.
its main industries are agriculture, dairy farming, livestock, fishing, and tourism, which is becoming the major service activity in the region. in addition, the government of the azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors. the main city of the azores is ponta delgada.
there are nine major azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. these are flores and corvo, to the west; graciosa, terceira, são jorge, pico, and faial in the centre; and são miguel, santa maria, and the formigas reef to the east. they extend for more than and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.
all the islands have volcanic origins, although some, such as santa maria, have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. mount pico, on the island of pico, is the highest point in portugal, at . if measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean to their peaks, which thrust high above the surface of the atlantic, the azores are actually some of the tallest mountains on the planet.
the climate of the azores is very mild for such a northerly location, being influenced by its distance from the continents and by the passing gulf stream. due to the marine influence, temperatures remain mild year-round. daytime temperatures normally fluctuate between and depending on season. temperatures above or below are unknown in the major population centres. it is also generally wet and cloudy.
the culture, dialect, cuisine, and traditions of the azorean islands vary considerably, because these once-uninhabited and remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries.
a small number of alleged hypogea, earthen structures carved into rocks that were used for burials, have been identified on the islands of corvo, santa maria and terceira by portuguese archaeologist nuno ribeiro, who speculated that they might date back 2000 years, implying a human presence on the island before the portuguese. these kinds of structures have been used in the azores to store cereals, however, and suggestions by ribeiro that they might be burial sites are unconfirmed. detailed examination and dating to authenticate the validity of these speculations is lacking. it is unclear whether these structures are natural or man-made and whether they predate the 15th-century portuguese colonization of the azores. therefore, clear confirmation of a pre-portuguese human presence in the archipelago has not yet been published.
the islands were known in the fourteenth century, and parts of them appear in the catalan atlas. in 1427, a captain sailing for prince henry the navigator, possibly gonçalo velho, may have rediscovered the azores, but this is not certain. in thomas ashe's 1813 work, "a history of the azores", the author identified a fleming, joshua vander berg of bruges, who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to lisbon. he stated that the portuguese explored the area and claimed it for portugal. other stories note the discovery of the first islands (são miguel island, santa maria island and terceira island) by sailors in the service of henry the navigator, although there are few documents to support the claims.
although it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name from the goshawk ( in portuguese), a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted in the islands.
there were no large animals on santa maria, so after its discovery and before settlement began, sheep were let loose on the island to supply future settlers with food. settlement did not take place right away, however. there was not much interest among the portuguese people to live in an isolated archipelago so far from civilization. gonçalo velho cabral patiently gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436), however, and sailed to establish colonies first on santa maria and then on são miguel.
settlers cleared bush and rocks to plant crops—grain, grape vines, sugar cane, and other plants suitable for local use and of commercial value. they brought domesticated animals, such as chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs and built houses and established villages.
the archipelago was largely settled from mainland portugal. portuguese settlers came from the provinces of algarve, minho, alentejo and ribatejo as well as madeira. são miguel was first settled in 1449, the settlers – mainly from the estremadura, alto alentejo and algarve areas of mainland portugal, under the command of gonçalo velho cabral – landed at the site of modern-day povoação. many early settlers were portuguese sephardic jews who fled the pressures of inquisition in mainland portugal. in 1522, vila franca do campo, then the capital of the island, was devastated by an earthquake and landslide that killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to ponta delgada. the town of vila franca do campo was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port. ponta delgada received its city status in 1546. from the first settlement, the pioneers applied themselves to agriculture and by the 15th century graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. the goods were sent to terceira largely because of the proximity of the island.
during the 18th and 19th centuries, graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including chateaubriand, the french writer who passed through upon his escape to america during the french revolution; almeida garrett, the portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and prince albert of monaco, the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the azores. he arrived on his yacht "hirondelle", and visited the "furna da caldeira", the noted hot springs grotto. in 1869, the author mark twain published "the innocents abroad", a travel book, where he described his time in the azores.
the first reference to the island of são jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. in 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble flemish native "wilhelm van der haegen". arriving at topo, where he lived and died, he became known as "guilherme da silveira" to the islanders. joão vaz corte-real received the captaincy of the island in 1483. velas became a town before the end of the 15th century. by 1490, there were 2,000 flemings living in the islands of terceira, pico, faial, são jorge and flores. because there was such a large flemish settlement, the azores became known as the flemish islands or the isles of flanders. prince henry the navigator was responsible for this settlement. his sister, isabel, was married to duke philip of burgundy of which flanders was a part. there was a revolt against philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. isabel appealed to henry to allow some of the unruly flemings to settle in the azores. he granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.
the settlement of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of algarve and alentejo. in 1583, philip ii of spain, as king of portugal, sent his fleet to clear the azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the azores as a staging post for a rival pretender to the portuguese throne. following the success of his fleet at the battle of ponta delgada captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by philip ii. opponents receiving the news variously portrayed philip ii as a despot or "black legend"; the sort of insult widely made against contemporary monarchs engaged in aggressive empire building and the european wars of religion. an english raid of the azores in 1589 successfully plundered some harbouring ships and islands; a repeat eight years later, the islands voyage, failed. spain held the azores under the "babylonian captivity" of 1580–1642. in the late 16th century, the azores and madeira began to face problems of overpopulation. spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to brazil.
following the death of henry, the cardinal-king of portugal the nation fell into a dynastic crisis with various pretenders to the crown of portugal. following his proclamation in santarém, antónio, prior of crato was acclaimed in the azores in 1580 (through his envoy antónio da costa), but was expelled from the continent following the battle of alcântara. yet, through the administration of cipriano de figueiredo, governor of terceira (who continued to govern terceira in the name of ill-fated, former-king sebastian of portugal), the azoreans resisted attempts to conquer the islands (including specifically at the battle of salga). it was figueiredo and violante do canto who helped organize a resistance on terceira that influenced some of the response of the other islands, even as internal politics and support for philip's faction increased on the other islands (including specifically on são miguel, where the gonçalvez da câmara family supported the spanish pretender).
the azores were the last part of the portuguese empire to resist philip's reign over portugal (macau resisted any official recognition) and were returned to portuguese control with the end of the iberian union in 1640, not by the professional military, who were used in the restoration war in the mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified castilian garrison.
the portuguese civil war (1828–1834) had strong repercussions in the azores. in 1829, in praia da vitória, the liberals won over the absolutists, making terceira island the main headquarters of the new portuguese regime and also where the council of regency () of maria ii of portugal was established.
beginning in 1868, portugal issued its stamps overprinted with "" for use in the islands. between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.
from 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, equivalent (except in area) to those in the portuguese mainland. the division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).
in 1931 the azores (together with madeira and portuguese guinea) revolted against the ditadura nacional and were held briefly by military rebels.
in 1943, during world war ii, the portuguese ruler antónio de oliveira salazar leased air and naval bases in the azores to great britain. the occupation of these facilities in october 1943 was codenamed "operation alacrity" by the british.
this was a key turning point in the battle of the atlantic, enabling the royal air force, the u.s. army air forces, and the u.s. navy to provide aerial coverage in the mid-atlantic gap. this helped them to protect convoys and to hunt hostile german u-boats.
in 1944, the u.s. constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of santa maria. in 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of terceira, and it is named lajes field. this air base is in an area called lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a large farm. lajes field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. this air base is a joint american and portuguese venture. lajes field continues to support the american and portuguese armed forces. during the cold war, u.s. navy p-3 orion antisubmarine warfare squadrons patrolled the north atlantic ocean for soviet navy submarines and surface warships. since its opening, lajes field has been used for refuelling american cargo planes bound for europe, africa, and the middle east. the u.s. navy keeps a small squadron of its ships at the harbor of praia da vitória, southeast of lajes field.
the airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from the other islands in the azores, europe, africa, and north america.
in 1976, the azores became the autonomous region of the azores (), one of the autonomous regions of portugal, and the subdistricts of the azores were eliminated.
in 2003, the azores saw international attention when united states president george w. bush, british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister josé maría aznar and portuguese prime minister josé manuel durão barroso held a summit there days before the commencement of the iraq war.
the archipelago of the azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the atlantic ocean and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between 36.5°–40° north latitudes and 24.5°–31.5° west longitudes) in an area approximately wide. the islands of the azores emerged from what is called the azores plateau, a 5.8 million km region that is morphologically accented by a depth of .
from a geostructural perspective the azores is located above an active triple junction between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the north american plate, the eurasian plate and the african plate), a condition that has translated into the existence of many faults and fractures in this region of the atlantic. the westernmost islands of the archipelago (corvo and flores) are located in the north american plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the eurasian and african plates.
the principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the azores are the mid-atlantic ridge, the terceira rift, the azores fracture zone and the glória fault. the mid-atlantic ridge is the main frontier between the american plate and the african-eurasian plates that crosses the azores plateau between the islands of flores and faial from north to south then to the southwest; it is an extensive form crossed by many transform faults running perpendicular to its north-south orientation, that is seismically active and susceptible to volcanism. the terceira rift is a system of fractures that extends from the mid-atlantic ridge to the glória fault that represents the main frontier between the eurasian and african plates. it is defined by a line of submarine volcanoes and island mounts that extend northwest to southeast for about , from the area west of graciosa until the islets of the formigas, that includes the islands of graciosa, terceira and são miguel. its northwest limit connects to the mid-atlantic ridge, while the southeast section intersects the gloria fault southeast of the island of santa maria. the azores fracture zone extends from the glória fault and encompasses a relatively inactive area to the south of the islands of the central and eastern groups north to the terceira rift, along a 45° angle. the glória fault, for its part, extends along a linear line from the azores to the azores–gibraltar transform fault.
the island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the azores triple junction; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events, while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle, some associate with an azores hotspot. most of the volcanic activity has centered, primarily, along the terceira rift. from the beginning of the island's settlement, around the 15th century, there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions (15 terrestrial and 13 submarine). the last significant volcanic eruption, the capelinhos volcano (), occurred off the coast of the island of faial in 1957; the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of serreta and in the pico-são jorge channel. the islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology including many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes (such as the gruta das torres, algar do carvão, gruta do natal, gruta das cinco ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of feteiras, faial, the mistério of prainha or são joão on pico island) in addition to the currently inactive cones in central são miguel island, the aforementioned capelinhos on faial, the volcanic complexes of terceira or plinian caldeira of corvo island.
the islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the neogene period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of santa maria during the miocene epoch (from circa 8 million years ago). the sequence of the island formation has been generally characterized as: santa maria (8.12 ma), são miguel (4.1 ma), terceira (3.52 ma), graciosa (2.5 ma), flores (2.16 ma), faial (0.7 ma), são jorge (0.55 ma), corvo (0.7 ma) and the youngest, pico (0.27 ma). although all islands have experienced volcanism during their geological history, within recorded "human settlement" history the islands of santa maria, graciosa, flores, and corvo have not experienced any volcanic eruptions; in addition to active fumaroles and hot-springs, the remaining islands have had sporadic eruptions since the 14th century. apart from the capelinhos volcano in 1957–58, the last recorded instance of "island formation" occurred off the coast of são miguel, when the island of sabrina was briefly formed.
owing to its geodynamic environment, the region has been center of intense seismic activity, particularly along its tectonic boundaries on the mid-atlantic ridge and terceira rift. seismic events although frequent, usually tectonic or vulco-tectonic in nature, but in general low to medium intensities, occasionally punctuated by events of level 5 or greater on the richter magnitude scale. the most severe earthquake was registered in 1757, near calheta on the island of são jorge, which exceeded 7 on the richter magnitude scale. in comparison, the 1522 earthquake that was mentioned by historian gaspar frutuoso measured 6.8, but its effects were judged to be x ("extreme") on the mercalli intensity scale, and was responsible for the destruction of vila franca do campo and landslides that may have killed more than 5,000 of the inhabitants.
the nine islands that compose the archipelago occupy a surface area of , that includes both the main islands and many islets located in their vicinities. each of the islands has its own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique: corvo (the smallest island) is a crater of a major plinian eruption; flores (its neighbor on the north american plate) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; faial characterized for its shield volcano and caldera (cabeço gordo); pico, is the highest point, at , in the azores and continental portugal; graciosa is known for its active furnas do enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; são jorge is a long slender island, formed from fissural eruptions over thousands of years; terceira, almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; são miguel is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and santa maria, the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago. they range in surface area from the largest, são miguel, at to the smallest, corvo, at approximately .
these islands can be divided into three recognizable groups located on the azores plateau:
in addition, several sub-surface reefs (particularly the dollabarat on the fringe of the formigas), banks (specifically the princess alice bank and d. joão de castro bank, as well as many hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts are monitored by the regional authorities, owing to the complex geotectonic and socioeconomic significance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.
the archipelago lies in the palearctic ecozone, forming a unique biome that includes the macaronesian subtropical laurissilva, with many endemic species of plants and animals. in total, there are at least 6112 terrestrial species, of which about 411 are endemic. the majority (75%) of these endemics are animals, mostly arthropods and mollusks. new species are found regularly in the azores (e.g., 30 different new species of land snails were discovered circa 2013).
even though the azores look very green and sometimes wild, the vegetation has been extremely altered. a great part of it has been wiped out in the past 600 years for its valuable wood (for tools, buildings, boats, fire wood, and so on) and to clear land for agriculture. as a result, it is estimated that more than half of insects on the graciosa island have disappeared or will become extinct. many cultivated places (which are traditionally dedicated to pasture or to growing colocasia, potatoes, maize and other crops) have now been abandoned, especially as a result of emigration. consequently, some invasive plants have filled these deserted and disturbed lands. hydrangeas are another potential pest, but their threat is less serious. notwithstanding the fact that hydrangeas were introduced from america or asia, some locals consider them a symbol of the archipelago and propagate them along roadsides, helping the plants to escape into the wild. "cryptomeria", the japanese cedar, is a conifer extensively grown for its timber. the two most common of these alien species are "pittosporum undulatum" and "acacia melanoxylon". they are usually restricted to ancient agricultural land and only rarely penetrate into undisturbed native vegetation.
reforestation efforts with native laurissilva vegetation have been done successfully in many parts of the azores.
the azores has at least two endemic bird species. the azores bullfinch, or "priolo", is restricted to remnant laurisilva forest in the mountains at the eastern end of são miguel and is classified by birdlife international as endangered. monteiro's storm-petrel, described to science as recently as 2008, is known to breed in just two locations in the islands, but may occur more widely. an extinct species of owl, the são miguel scops owl, has also recently been described, which probably became extinct after human settlement due to habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species. the azores also has an endemic bat, the azores noctule, which is unusual in regularly feeding during the day.
the islets of the formigas (the portuguese word for "ants"), including the area known as the dollabarat reef, have a rich environment of maritime species, such as black coral and manta rays, different species of sharks, whales, and sea turtles. on são miguel there are notable micro-habitats formed by hot springs that host extremophile microorganisms.
17 new marine reserves (with special conservation status) were added to the azorean marine park (which covers currently around 900.000 km)
the archipelago is spread out in the area between 37° n and the parallels of latitude that pass through the lisbon area (38° 43' / 38° 55' n), giving it a generally tepid, oceanic, subtropical climate, with mild annual oscillations. daily maximum temperatures usually range between . the average annual rainfall increases from east to west, ranging from 700 to 1600 millimetres (27.6–63 in) in the east and reaching on mount pico, the highest portuguese mountain at . the azores high, an area of high atmospheric pressure, is named after the islands. under the köppen climate classification, there are different local climates, one of which is "dry-summer subtropical", often referred to as "mediterranean". rivas martinez data presents several different bioclimatic zones for the azores. seasonal lag is extreme in the low-sun half of the year, with december being milder than april in terms of mean temperatures.
azores have the warmest winters in europe (still within the european continental plate). during summer the lag is somewhat lower, with august being the warmest month. there has never been a frost, snowfall or freeze recorded at sea level on any of the islands. the coldest weather in winter usually comes from northwesterly air masses originating from labrador in canada. but because those air masses are modified as they pass across the warmer atlantic ocean, temperatures by day even then exceed .
in addition, the instituto de meteorologia has identified the following weather extremes:
the azores are known for small hurricanes. a total of 14 tropical or subtropical cyclones have affected the region in history. most of them were either extratropical or tropical storms when they affected the region, although several category 1 hurricanes have reached the azores. only one major hurricane has ever impacted the azores; hurricane ophelia in 2017, at category 3 intensity. the following storms have impacted the region while at category 1 strength: hurricane fran in 1973, hurricane emmy in 1976, hurricane gordon in 2006, hurricane gordon in 2012 and hurricane alex in 2016. several tropical storms have hit the region, including tropical storm irma in 1978, hurricane bonnie in 1992, hurricane charley in 1992, hurricane erika in 1997, and hurricane gaston in 2016. storms that were extratropical when they impacted the region include hurricane tanya in 1995, tropical storm ana in 2003 and tropical storm grace in 2009. in addition, the 2005 azores subtropical storm affected the region in october 2005.
the azores are divided into 19 municipalities (); each municipality is further divided into parishes (), of which there is a total of 156 in all of the azores. the municipalities, by island, are:
there are six cities (portuguese: "cidades") in the azores: ponta delgada, lagoa and ribeira grande on the island of são miguel; angra do heroísmo and praia da vitória on the island of terceira, and horta on faial. three of these, ponta delgada, angra and horta are considered capital/administrative cities to the regional government: homes to the president (ponta delgada), the judiciary (angra) and the regional assembly (horta). angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the roman catholic diocese of angra, the episcopal see of the azores.
according to the 2011 census, population in the azores was 246,746 at a density of .
the azores were uninhabited when portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; settlement began in 1439 with migrants from several regions of mainland portugal and from madeira. the islands were populated mainly by portuguese immigrants from the algarve, alentejo, and minho; in an effort to escape the dangers of the portuguese inquisition on mainland portugal, however, many portuguese sephardic jews settled on the islands in large numbers. azorean jews had surnames such as: rodrigues, pacheco, oliveira, pereira, pimentel, nunes, mendes, pinto, álvares, henriques, cardozo, teixeira, vasconcelos etc. the islands were also settled by moorish prisoners, and african slaves from guinea, cape verde and são tomé; flemish, french and galicians also contributed to the initial settlement. thus the azorean population received a significant contribution from people with genetic backgrounds other than portuguese.
the nature of the economy dictated that african slavery never became common in the azores because they were sent to brazil and the caribbean. only a few remained in the azores to help with domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying african slaves.
africans, moors, jews, scots, germans, italians, french, spanish, flemish and portuguese all migrated to the azores.
as in continental portugal, the most frequent mtdna haplogroup in the azores is h (45.2%), followed by u (16.7%), t (10.1%), k (6.5%), pre-hv clades (5.6%) and a smaller african l haplogroups frequency (3.4%) than in madeira.
inhabitants of the various islands have dna of various origins. a minority on the islands has non-european ancestry.
since the 17th century, many azoreans have emigrated, mainly to brazil, uruguay, the united states and canada. rhode island and southeastern massachusetts, especially the cities of new bedford, bristol, barrington, pawtucket, central falls, west warwick, hudson, marlborough, east providence, river point, somerset, taunton and fall river have been, and remain, the primary destination for azorean emigrants. emigrants from the east coast returned to their homeland and taught the american dory fishing technique to the portuguese who began catching cod again on the grand bank in the 19th century.
northern california was the final destination for many of the massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the san joaquin valley, especially the city of turlock, just south of modesto. in the late 1800s many azoreans emigrated to the hawaiian islands. the tuna fishing industry drew a significant number of azoreans to the point loma neighborhood of san diego, in southern california. from 1921 to 1977, about 250,000 azoreans immigrated to rhode island and massachusetts.
many azoreans also moved to bermuda and hawaii (portuguese immigration to hawaii). florianópolis and porto alegre in the southern region of brazil were founded by azoreans, who accounted for over half of rio grande do sul and santa catarina's population in the late 18th century. as late as 1960 mass immigration currents were registered to brazil, and many were from the azores.
since 1976, the azores is an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the portuguese republic. it has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. its governmental organs include: the legislative assembly, a unicameral parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal suffrage for a four-year term; the regional government and presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a president, a vice-president and seven regional secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. it is represented in the council of ministers by a representative appointed by the president of the republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older portuguese representative that was appointed by the president of the republic, beholden to the council of state and coincident with the president).
since becoming a portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in ponta delgada, the legislative branch in horta, and the judicial branch in angra do heroísmo.
the islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. in addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: topo (today integrated into the municipality of calheta, são jorge); praia (today integrated into municipality of santa cruz da graciosa); são sebastião (today an integral part of the municipality of angra do heroísmo); capelas (now part of the municipality of ponta delgada); and água de pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of lagoa). these civil parishes still retain their titles of "vila" in name only; the populations of capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. the municipalities are further subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of corvo (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).
azorean politics is dominated by the two largest portuguese political parties, the social democratic party (psd) and the socialist party (ps), the latter holding a majority in the regional legislative assembly. the democratic and social center / people's party (cds/pp), the left bloc (be), the unitarian democratic coalition (cdu) and the people's monarchist party (ppm) are also represented in the local parliament. currently, , the socialist party (ps) and its leader, carlos césar have a plurality of the seats in the assembly, and operate the regional government. although the ps dominates the regional politics, the psd is traditionally popular in city and town council elections.
as part of portugal, the azores are in the european union and schengen area. they are also in the european union customs union and vat area, but levy a lower rate of vat than applies on the mainland. the azores, like madeira and the canary islands, are among member state territories with special status, as one of the designated "outermost regions".
each of the nine islands has an airport, although the majority are airfields rather than airports. the commercial terminals in ponta delgada, horta, vila do porto and santa cruz das flores are operated by ana – aeroportos de portugal, a public entity that oversees the operations of airports across portugal. the remaining, except for lajes field, are operated by the regional government. lajes is a military airbase, as well as a commercial airport, and is operated by the portuguese armed forces in conjunction with the united states.
the airports are:
the azores has had a long history of water transport to overcome distances and establish inter-community contacts and trade. consequently, the shipbuilding industry developed in many islands, from small fishing boats, to whaling sloops to larger passenger services. passenger traffic to the main islands (são miguel, santa maria, terceira and faial) began in the 17th century, and between the 18th–19th century, the "pico yacht" controlled the lucrative summer traffic season.
after 1871, the "insulana shipping company" was the only entity responsible for regular traffic between the islands (except corvo), madeira and the united states. yet, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships were sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. for the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands ceased (except between faial-pico and lajes das flores-vila do corvo).
"transmaçor" (transportes marítimos açorianos, lda.) was founded on 22 december 1987, resulting from the fusion of "empresa das lanchas do pico, ld", owners of the ships "espalamaca" and "calheta" (ships that had travelled the canal between faial and pico for several years); "empresa açoreana de transportes marítimos, lda", which operated the ship "terra alta"; and "transcanal (transportes marítimos do canal, lda.)" operator the traditional boats "picaroto" and "manuel josé". in the central group, the shipping company operates four to six time daily connections between horta and madalena throughout the year, using its small fleet of ships ("cruzeiro das ilhas", "cruzeiro do canal", "expresso das ilhas" and "expresso do triângulo"), in addition to inter-island connections between faial, pico, são jorge and terceira during the summer months.
meanwhile, new initiatives began in the late 1990s: the catamaran "iapetos" began services, followed by "lady of mann" and "golfinho azul" (chartered by açorline).
in 2005, "atlânticoline" was established, providing services with the ships "ilha azul" and , later adding the "viking" in 2009. in 2009, atlanticoline was involved in a controversial rejection of a 750-passenger, 150-vehicle ship ordered from the "estaleiros de viana do castelo" ("viana do castelo shipyards"). the "atlantida", a 50 million euro cruiser (as part of a two-ship deal with the other named "anticiclone") was rejected in 2009 by atlanticoline for the under-performance of the power-plant. although it would only result in a five-minute delay between islands, the public company rejected the ship, and the contract was broken over the builder's inability to deliver the required ship on time. while, the ship was being shopped to other interested parties (hugo chávez once considered purchasing the ferryboat in 2010), no interested buyers appeared, and envc decided to cede the "atlantida" to atlânticoline as part of the latter's open international competition to charter two ships in 2012.
on 20 june 2011, the regional government announced that it would purchase 60% of transmaçor, equivalent to 500,000 euro of the company's capital. with this transaction the autonomous government of the azores ceded control, of which it once had 88% of the capital. the signed memorandum of understanding concluded negotiations between the various parties involved, under which the liability of transmaçor (worth a total of 8 million euro) was divided equally between the region and businessman josé almeida, who is now the holder of a majority stake in the company.
similarly, the regional government approved the consolidation of the three individual port authorities (administração dos portos do triângulo e grupo ocidental, administração dos portos da terceira e graciosa and the administração dos portos das ilhas de são miguel e santa maria) and regional portos dos açores into one entity that resulted in a 2.2 million euro cost savings, in addition to a reduction from 11 to three administrators.
azoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.
religious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the azorean calendar. the most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the cult of the holy spirit, commonly referred to as the festivals of the holy spirit (or "espírito santo"), rooted in millenarian dogma and held on all islands from may to september. these festivals are very important to the azorean people, who are primarily roman catholic, and combine religious rituals with processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. these events are centred around "treatros" or "impérios", small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. on terceira, for example, these impérios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. the events focus on the members of local parishes, not tourists, but all are welcome, as sharing is one of the main principles of the festivals. some limited events focus on tourists, including a public event that the city government of ponta delgada on the island of são miguel holds, which attracts visitors and locals.
another event, the festival of the lord holy christ of the miracles (or "senhor santo cristo dos milagres") in ponta delgada on the island of são miguel, is the largest individual religious event in the azores, and takes place on rogation sunday. pilgrims from within the portuguese diaspora normally travel to ponta delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the festival of senhor santo cristo occur over a period of a week and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the azores and to the portuguese diaspora.
the sanjoaninas festivities in angra do heroísmo on terceira are held in june honoring saint anthony, saint peter and saint john the baptist, in a large religious celebration.
the festival of our lady of lourdes (or "nossa senhora de lourdes"), patron saint of whalers, begins in lajes on pico island on the last sunday of august and runs through the week—whalers week. it is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of whale hunting. the wine harvest festival (or "festa das vindimas"), takes place during the first week of september and is a century-old custom of the people of pico.
on corvo the people celebrate their patron saint nossa senhora dos milagres (our lady of miracles) on 15 august every year in addition to the festivals of the divine holy spirit. the festival da maré de agosto (august sea festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 august in praia formosa on santa maria. also, the semana do mar (sea week), dedicated almost exclusively to water sports, takes place in august in the city of horta, on faial.
carnaval is also celebrated in the azores. parades and pageants are the heart of the carnaval festivities. there is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats.
the traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing as is the running of bulls in the streets.

the outback is the vast, remote interior of australia. "the outback" is more remote than those areas named "the bush", which include any location outside the main urban areas.
while often envisaged as being arid, the outback regions extend from the northern to southern australian coastlines and encompass a number of climatic zones, including tropical and monsoonal climates in northern areas, arid areas in the "red centre" and semi-arid and temperate climates in southerly regions.
geographically, the outback is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact natural environment and, in many places, low-intensity land uses, such as pastoralism (livestock grazing) in which production is reliant on the natural environment.
culturally, the outback is deeply ingrained in australian heritage, history and folklore. in 2009, as part of the q150 celebrations, the queensland outback was announced as one of the q150 icons of queensland for its role as a "natural attraction".
indigenous australians have lived in the outback for approximately 50,000 years and occupied all outback regions, including the driest deserts, when europeans first entered central australia in the 1800s. many indigenous australians retain strong physical and cultural links to their traditional country and are legally recognised as the traditional owners of large parts of the outback under commonwealth native title legislation.
early european exploration of inland australia was sporadic. more focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas. the first party to successfully cross the blue mountains just outside sydney was led by gregory blaxland in 1813, 25 years after the colony was established. people starting with john oxley in 1817, 1818 and 1821, followed by charles sturt in 1829–1830 attempted to follow the westward-flowing rivers to find an "inland sea", but these were found to all flow into the murray river and darling river which turn south.
from 1858 onwards, the so-called "afghan" cameleers and their beasts played an instrumental role in opening up the outback and helping to build infrastructure.
over the period 1858 to 1861, john mcdouall stuart led six expeditions north from adelaide, south australia into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of australia and returning without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. this contrasts with the ill-fated burke and wills expedition in 1860–61 which was much better funded, but resulted in the deaths of three of the members of the transcontinental party.
the overland telegraph line was constructed in the 1870s along the route identified by stuart.
in 1865 the surveyor george goyder, using changes in vegetation patterns, mapped a line in south australia, north of which he considered rainfall to be too unreliable to support agriculture.
exploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when len beadell explored, surveyed and built many roads in support of the nuclear weapons tests at emu field and maralinga and rocket testing on the woomera prohibited area. mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developed.
while the early explorers used horses to cross the outback, the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was anna hingley, who rode from broome to cairns in 2006.
the paucity of industrial land use has led to the outback being recognised globally as one of the largest remaining intact natural areas on earth. global "human footprint" and wilderness reviews highlight the importance of outback australia as one of the world's large natural areas, along with the boreal forests and tundra regions in north america, the sahara and gobi deserts and the tropical forests of the amazon and congo basins.
the savanna (or grassy woodlands) of northern australia are the largest, intact savanna regions in the world. in the south, the great western woodlands, which occupy , an area larger than all of england and wales, are the largest remaining temperate woodland left on earth.
reflecting the wide climatic and geological variation, the outback contains a wealth of distinctive and ecologically-rich ecosystems. major land types include:
the australian outback is full of very important well-adapted wildlife, although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer. many animals, such as red kangaroos and dingoes, hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.
birdlife is prolific, most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk. huge flocks of budgerigars, cockatoos, corellas and galahs are often sighted. on bare ground or roads during the winter, various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun, but they are rarely seen during the summer months.
feral animals such as camels thrive in central australia, brought to australia by pastoralists and explorers, along with the early afghan drivers. feral horses known as 'brumbies' are station horses that have run wild. feral pigs, foxes, cats and rabbits are other imported animals also degrading the environment, so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelands.
the outback is home to a diverse set of animal species, such as the kangaroo, emu and dingo. the dingo fence was built to restrict movements of dingoes and wild dogs into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent. the marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing, on cattle stations which are leased from the federal government. while small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols.
riversleigh, in queensland, is one of australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a world heritage site in 1994. the 100 km (39 sq mi) area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of oligocene and miocene age.
the largest industry across the outback, in terms of the area occupied, is pastoralism, in which cattle, sheep, and sometimes goats, are grazed in mostly intact, natural ecosystems. widespread use of bore water, obtained from underground aquifers, including the great artesian basin, has enabled livestock to be grazed across vast areas in which no permanent surface water exists naturally.
capitalising on the lack of pasture improvement and absence of fertiliser and pesticide use, many outback pastoral properties are certified as organic livestock producers. in 2014, , most of which is in outback australia, was fully certified as organic farm production, making australia the largest certified organic production area in the world.
"nothing says australia quite like our outback," states the national tourism web site. tourism is a major industry across the outback, and commonwealth and state tourism agencies explicitly target outback australia as a desirable destination for domestic and international travellers. there is no breakdown of tourism revenues for the "outback" "per se". however, regional tourism is a major component of national tourism incomes. tourism australia explicitly markets nature-based and indigenous-led experiences to tourists. in the 2015–2016 financial year, 815,000 visitors spent $988 million while on holidays in the northern territory alone.
there are many popular tourist attractions in the outback. some of the well known destinations include:
other than agriculture and tourism, the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining. owing to the almost complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the permian (in many areas since the cambrian) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, manganese and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, copper, lead and zinc ores. because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. major mines and mining areas in the outback include opals at coober pedy, lightning ridge and white cliffs, metals at broken hill, tennant creek, olympic dam and the remote challenger mine. oil and gas are extracted in the cooper basin around moomba.
in western australia the argyle diamond mine in the kimberley is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply. the pilbara region's economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industries. most of australia's iron ore is also mined in the pilbara and it also has one of the world's major manganese mines.
aboriginal communities in outback regions, such as the anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara lands in northern south australia, have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities, in coastal areas.
the total population of the outback in australia declined from 700,000 in 1996 to 690,000 in 2006. the largest decline was in the outback northern territory, while the kimberley and pilbara showed population increases during the same period. the sex ratio is 1040 males for 1000 females and 17% of the total population is indigenous.
the royal flying doctor service (rfds) started service in 1928 and helps people who live in the outback of australia. in former times, serious injuries or illnesses often meant death due to the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel.
in most outback communities, the number of children is too small for a conventional school to operate. children are educated at home by the school of the air. originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio, but now satellite telecommunication is used instead.
some children attend boarding school, mostly only those in secondary school.
the concept of 'back' country, which initially meant land beyond the settled regions, was in existence in 1800. crossing of the blue mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception. the term "outback" was first used in print in 1869, when the writer clearly meant west of wagga wagga, new south wales.
it is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located "beyond the black stump". the location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. it has been suggested that the term comes from the "black stump wine saloon" that once stood about out of coolah, new south wales on the gunnedah road. it is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby black stump run and black stump creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west new south wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.
"the never-never" is a term referring to remoter parts of the australian outback. the outback can also be referred to as "back of beyond", "back o' bourke" although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. the well-watered north of the continent is often called the "top end" and the arid interior "the red centre", owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscape.
the outback is criss-crossed by historic tracks. most of the major highways have an excellent bitumen surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads. tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and spare fuel, tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken. drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious – it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray onto roads. travelling in remote areas in northern australia is not advisable during the wet season (november to april), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. in the remotest parts of australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. in addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as road trains) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by over 46 tyres.
the stuart highway runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the adelaide–darwin railway. there is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the south-west to the north-east to create an all-weather road named the outback highway, crossing the continent diagonally from laverton, western australia (north of kalgoorlie, through the northern territory to winton, in queensland.
air transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures. most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a fly-in fly-out workforce. most outback sheep stations and cattle stations have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane. medical and ambulance services are provided by the royal flying doctor service. the school of the air is a radio-based school using the rfds radios.
visitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles, or take organised tours. travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning. however travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a four-wheel drive). on very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. it is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, epirb etc.). many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help. travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search, than a person, so in the event of a breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.

the absolute infinite ("symbol": ω) is an extension of the idea of infinity proposed by mathematician georg cantor.
it can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or transfinite.
cantor linked the absolute infinite with god, and believed that it had various mathematical properties, including the reflection principle: every property of the absolute infinite is also held by some smaller object.
cantor said:
cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to richard dedekind (text in square brackets not present in original):
the idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems paradoxical to many. this is related to cesare burali-forti's "paradox" which states that there can be no greatest ordinal number. all of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. however, as in cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.
more generally, as noted by a. w. moore, there can be no end to the process of set formation, and thus no such thing as the "totality of all sets", or the "set hierarchy". any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the hierarchy and thus failing to contain every set.
a standard solution to this problem is found in zermelo's set theory, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property "and lie in some given set" (zermelo's axiom of separation). this allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.
while this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. it seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. indeed, naive set theory might be said to be based on this notion. although zermelo's fix allows a class to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the meta-language may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. for example, the class of all sets would be a proper class. this is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in set theory and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as new foundations by willard van orman quine.

in engineering and its various subdisciplines, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. it may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests.
in systems engineering it may involve black-box testing performed on a system (for example: a piece of software, lots of manufactured mechanical parts, or batches of chemical products) prior to its delivery.
in software testing the istqb defines "acceptance testing" as: acceptance testing is also known as user acceptance testing (uat), end-user testing, operational acceptance testing (oat), acceptance-test-driven development (attd) or field (acceptance) testing. acceptance criteria is the criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity.
a smoke test may be used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a build of software to the main testing process.
testing is a set of activities conducted to facilitate discovery and/or evaluation of properties of one or more items under test. each individual test, known as a test case, exercises a set of predefined test activities, developed to drive the execution of the test item to meet test objectives; including correct implementation, error identification, quality verification and other valued detail. the test environment is usually designed to be identical, or as close as possible, to the anticipated production environment. it includes all facilities, hardware, software, firmware, procedures and/or documentation intended for or used to perform the testing of software.
uat and oat test cases are ideally derived in collaboration with business customers, business analysts, testers, and developers. it's essential that these tests include both business logic tests as well as operational environment conditions. the business customers (product owners) are the primary stakeholders of these tests. as the test conditions successfully achieve their acceptance criteria, the stakeholders are reassured the development is progressing in the right direction.
the acceptance test suite may need to be performed multiple times, as all of the test cases may not be executed within a single test iteration.
the acceptance test suite is run using predefined acceptance test procedures to direct the testers which data to use, the step-by-step processes to follow and the expected result following execution. the actual results are retained for comparison with the expected results. if the actual results match the expected results for each test case, the test case is said to pass. if the quantity of non-passing test cases does not breach the project's predetermined threshold, the test suite is said to pass. if it does, the system may either be rejected or accepted on conditions previously agreed between the sponsor and the manufacturer.
the anticipated result of a successful test execution:
the objective is to provide confidence that the developed product meets both the functional and non-functional requirements. the purpose of conducting acceptance testing is that once completed, and provided the acceptance criteria are met, it is expected the sponsors will sign-off on the product development/enhancement as satisfying the defined requirements (previously agreed between business and product provider/developer).
user acceptance testing (uat) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user. it is not system testing (ensuring software does not crash and meets documented requirements), but rather ensures that the solution will work for the user (i.e., tests that the user accepts the solution); software vendors often refer to this as "beta testing".
this testing should be undertaken by a subject-matter expert (sme), preferably the owner or client of the solution under test, and provide a summary of the findings for confirmation to proceed after trial or review. in software development, uat as one of the final stages of a project often occurs before a client or customer accepts the new system. users of the system perform tests in line with what would occur in real-life scenarios.
it is important that the materials given to the tester be similar to the materials that the end user will have. testers should be given real-life scenarios such as the three most common or difficult tasks that the users they represent will undertake.
the uat acts as a final verification of the required business functionality and proper functioning of the system, emulating real-world conditions on behalf of the paying client or a specific large customer. if the software works as required and without issues during normal use, one can reasonably extrapolate the same level of stability in production.
user tests, usually performed by clients or by end-users, do not normally focus on identifying simple cosmetic problems such as spelling errors, nor on showstopper defects, such as software crashes; testers and developers identify and fix these issues during earlier unit testing, integration testing, and system testing phases.
uat should be executed against test scenarios. test scenarios usually differ from system or functional test cases in that they represent a "player" or "user" journey. the broad nature of the test scenario ensures that the focus is on the journey and not on technical or system-specific details, staying away from "click-by-click" test steps to allow for a variance in users' behaviour. test scenarios can be broken down into logical "days", which are usually where the actor (player/customer/operator) or system (backoffice, front end) changes.
in industry, a common uat is a factory acceptance test (fat). this test takes place before installation of the equipment. most of the time testers not only check that the equipment meets the specification, but also that it is fully functional. a fat usually includes a check of completeness, a verification against contractual requirements, a proof of functionality (either by simulation or a conventional function test) and a final inspection.
the results of these tests give clients confidence in how the system will perform in production. there may also be legal or contractual requirements for acceptance of the system.
operational acceptance testing (oat) is used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service or system as part of a quality management system. oat is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects. this type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment.
acceptance testing is a term used in agile software development methodologies, particularly extreme programming, referring to the functional testing of a user story by the software development team during the implementation phase.
the customer specifies scenarios to test when a user story has been correctly implemented. a story can have one or many acceptance tests, whatever it takes to ensure the functionality works. acceptance tests are black-box system tests. each acceptance test represents some expected result from the system. customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the acceptance tests and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. acceptance tests are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. a user story is not considered complete until it has passed its acceptance tests. this means that new acceptance tests must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.
typical types of acceptance testing include the following
acceptance testing conducted at the site at which the product is developed and performed by employees of the supplier organization, to determine whether or not a component or system satisfies the requirements, normally including hardware as well as software.

the archbishopric of riga (, ) was an archbishopric in medieval livonia, a subject to the holy see. it was established in 1186 as the bishopric of livonia at ikšķile, then after moving to riga it became the bishopric of riga in 1202 and was elevated to an archbishopric in 1255.
the archbishops of riga were also the secular rulers of riga until 1561 when during the reformation the territory converted from catholicism to lutheranism and all church territories were secularized. the see was restored as a diocese of the catholic church in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923.
a new bishopric of livonia was established in latgalia in 1621 during the inflanty voivodeship of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth.
the archbishops of riga were innovators in the field of minting currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of rome. the names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on livonian pennies excavated at archaeological sites. in many cases, this is the only biographical data available. no livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.

albert frederick (; ; 7 may 1553 – 28 august 1618) was the duke of prussia, from 1568 until his death. he was a son of albert of prussia and anna marie of brunswick-lüneburg. he was the second and last prussian duke of the ansbach branch of the hohenzollern family.
albert became duke of prussia after paying feudal homage to his cousin, the king of poland, zygmunt august, on july 19, 1569 in lublin. the homage was described by the polish chronicler jan kochanowski in his work "proporzec" ("standard"). during the 1573 polish election, albert frederick attempted to gain acceptance to the polish senate but was opposed by the powerful jan zamoyski (later grand hetman of the crown of the kingdom of poland) who feared the influence of protestants in the polish legislative body. albert frederick initially refused to recognize the election of stefan bathory and supported the candidacy of maximilian of habsburg. however, at the toruń sejm of october 1576 he gave his support to the new monarch.
as the great grandson of the polish king casimir iv jagiellon, and as a duke in prussia who was fluent in polish, albert frederick was seriously considered for a time as a possible candidate for the polish throne. he particularly enjoyed the support of polish lutherans.
in 1572 he began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. in early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, george frederick of brandenburg-kulmbach (1539–1603). after george frederick's death in 1603, the polish king sigismund iii vasa appointed joachim frederick as regent in 1605, and permitted his son, john sigismund, to succeed him in 1611. the latter became duke of prussia after albert frederick's death in 1618.
albert frederick was married in 1573 to marie eleonore of cleves, a daughter of wilhelm, duke of jülich-cleves-berg and archduchess maria of austria (1531–1581). maria was a daughter of ferdinand i, holy roman emperor and anna of bohemia and hungary.
albert frederick and marie were parents to seven children:
at his death, the duchy passed to his son-in-law john sigismund, margrave of brandenburg, combining the two territories under a single dynasty and forming brandenburg-prussia.


ansbach (; ) is a city in the german state of bavaria. it is the capital of the administrative region of middle franconia. ansbach is southwest of nuremberg and north of munich, on the fränkische rezat (rezat river), a tributary of the main river. in 2004, its population was 40,723.
developed in the 8th century as a benedictine monastery, it became the seat of the hohenzollern family in 1331. in 1460, the margraves of brandenburg-ansbach lived here. the city has a castle known as margrafen–schloss, built between 1704–1738. it was not badly damaged during the world wars and hence retains its original historical baroque sheen. ansbach is now home to a us military base and to the ansbach university of applied sciences.
the city has connections via autobahn a6 and highways b13 and b14. ansbach station is on the nürnberg–crailsheim and treuchtlingen–würzburg railways and is the terminus of line s4 of the nuremberg s-bahn.
ansbach was originally called onoltesbach (about 790 ad), a term composed of three parts.
the individual word elements are "onold" (the city founder's name), the suffix "-es" (a possessive ending, like "-'s" in english) and the old high german expression "pah" or "bach" (for brook). the name of the city has slightly changed throughout the centuries into onoltespah (837 ad), onoldesbach (1141 ad), onoldsbach (1230 ad), onelspach (1338 ad), onsbach (1508 ad) and finally ansbach (1732 ad).
it was also formerly known as anspach.
according to folklore, towards the end of the 7th century a group of franconian peasants and their families went up into the wilderness to found a new settlement. their leader onold led them to an area called the "rezattal" (rezat valley). this is where they founded the "urhöfe" (meaning the first farms: knollenhof, voggenhof and rabenhof). gradually more settlers, such as the "winden-tribe" came, and the farms grew into a small village. many villages around ansbach were founded by the "winden" during that period (even today their settlements can easily identified by their names, like "meinhardszwinden", "dautenwinden" or "brodswinden" for example).
a benedictine monastery was established there around 748 by the frankish noble st gumbertus. the adjoining village of onoltesbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.
the counts of öttingen ruled over ansbach until the hohenzollern burgrave of nürnberg took over in 1331. the hohenzollerns made ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the margraviate of brandenburg in 1415. after the 1440 death of frederick i, a cadet branch of the family established itself as the margraves of ansbach. george the pious introduced the protestant reformation to ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of gumbertus abbey in 1563.
the markgrafenschloß was built between 1704–1738. its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century. in 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the kingdom of prussia. in 1796, the duke of zweibrücken, maximilian joseph — the future bavarian king max i joseph — was exiled to ansbach after zweibrücken had been taken by the french. in ansbach, maximilian von montgelas wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organization of bavaria, which is known as the ansbacher mémoire. napoleon forced prussia to cede ansbach and its principality to bavaria in the franco-prussian treaty of alliance signed at schönbrunn palace on 15 december 1805 at the end of the third coalition. the act was confirmed by the 1815 congress of vienna; prussia was compensated with the bavarian duchy of berg. ansbach became the capital of the circle of middle franconia following the unification of germany; at the time, it had a population of 12,635.
jewish families were resident in ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. they set up a jewish cemetery in the ruglaender strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the nazi regime in the kristallnacht. it was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. a plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. the jewish congregation built its synagogue at no 3 rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the sa, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. it serves today as a "symbolic house of god". a plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to jewish residents who were murdered during the holocaust. in 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the heil- und pflegeanstalt ansbach ["ansbach medical and nursing clinic"] to the extermination facilities sonnenstein and hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the action t4 euthanasia action. they were gassed there. at the clinic in ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug luminal and killed that way. a plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at no. 38 feuchtwangerstrasse.
during world war ii, a subcamp of flossenbürg concentration camp was located here. also during the second world war the luftwaffe and wehrmacht had bases here. the nearby airbase was the home station for the stab & i/kg53 (staff & 1st group of kampfgeschwader 53) operating 38 heinkel he 111 bombers. on 1 september 1939 this unit was one of the many that participated in the attack on poland that started the war. all of its bridges were destroyed during the course of the war. during the western allied invasion of germany in april 1945, the airfield was seized by the united states third army, and used by the usaaf 354th fighter group which flew p-47 thunderbolts from the aerodrome (designated alg r-82) from late april until the german capitulation on 7 may 1945. at the end of the war, 19-year-old student robert limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the us forces without a fight. he was betrayed by hitler youth and was hung from the portal of the city hall by the city's military commander, col. ("oberst") ernst meyer. several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, despite opposition from some residents — in the ludwigskirche, in the gymnasium carolinum and at no 6 kronenstrasse. after the second world war, ansbach belonged to the american zone. the american military authorities established a displaced persons (dp) camp in what used to be a sanatorium in what is today the strüth quarter.
bachwoche ansbach has been held in ansbach since 1947. since 1970, ansbach has enlarged its municipal area by incorporating adjacent communities. ansbach hosts several units of the u.s. armed forces, associated with german units under nato. there are five separate u.s. installations: shipton kaserne, home to 412th aviation support battalion, katterbach kaserne, formerly the home of the 1st infantry division's 4th combat aviation brigade, which has been replaced by the 12th combat aviation brigade as of 2006, as part of the 1st infantry division's return to fort riley, kansas; bismarck kaserne, which functions as a satellite post to katterbach, hosting their post theater, barracks, von steuben community center, military police, and other support agencies, barton barracks, home to the usag ansbach and bleidorn barracks, which has a library and housing, and urlas, which hosts the post exchange as well as a housing area opened in 2010. ansbach was also home to the headquarters of the 1st armored division (united states) from 1972 to the early 1990s.
on 24 july 2016 a bomb was detonated in a restaurant in the city, killing only the bomber himself and injuring few people. the perpetrator was reported to be a syrian refugee whose asylum application had been rejected but who had been given exceptional leave to remain until the security situation in syria returned to a safe condition. witnesses reported he had tried to enter a nearby music festival but had been turned away, before detonating his device outside a nearby wine bar.
climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. the köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is "" (marine west coast climate/oceanic climate).
around the time of the unification of germany in 1871, the chief manufactures of ansbach were woollen, cotton, and half-silk goods; earthenware; tobacco; cutlery; and playing cards. a considerable trade in grain, wool, and flax was also supported. by the onset of the first world war, it also produced machinery, toys, and embroidery.
today there is a large density of plastics industry in the city and rural districts around ansbach.
ansbach lies on the treuchtlingen-würzburg railway.
ansbach is twinned with:
in the novel "the schirmer inheritance" (1953) by eric ambler (1909–1998), sergeant franz schirmer of the ansbach dragoons is wounded in the battle of preussisch-eylau in 1807. he returns to ansbach to settle but changes his name as he has been posted as a deserter. the bulk of the novel concerns efforts by an american law firm to trace his descendants to claim an inheritance.

national alliance (, an) was a conservative political party in italy.
an was the successor of the post-fascist italian social movement (msi), which had moderated its policies over its last decades and finally distanced itself from its former ideology during a convention in fiuggi by dissolving into the new party in 1995.
gianfranco fini was the leader of an from its foundation through 2008, after being elected president of the chamber of deputies. fini was succeeded by ignazio la russa, who managed the merger of the party with forza italia (fi) into the people of freedom (pdl) in 2009. a group of former an members, led by la russa, left fi in 2012 in order to launch the brothers of italy (fdi), while others remained in the pdl and were among the founding members of the new forza italia (fi) in 2013.
national alliance, launched in 1994, was officially founded in january 1995, when the italian social movement (msi), the former neo-fascist party, merged with conservative elements of the former christian democracy, which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to corruption at its highest levels, exposed by the "mani pulite" investigation, and the italian liberal party, disbanded in the same year. former msi members were however still the bulk of the new party and former msi leader gianfranco fini was elected leader of the new party.
the an logo followed a template very similar to that of the democratic party of the left, with the logo of the direct predecessor party in a small circle, as a means of legally preventing others from using it. the name was suggested by an article on the italian newspaper "il tempo" written in 1992 by domenico fisichella, a prominent conservative academic. starting in the 1990s, the msi gradually transformed into a mainstream right-wing party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into an.
the party was part of all three house of freedoms coalition governments led by silvio berlusconi. gianfranco fini was nominated deputy prime minister after the 2001 general election and was foreign minister from november 2004 to may 2006.
when gianfranco fini visited israel in late november 2003 in the function of italian deputy prime minister, he labeled the racial laws issued by the fascist regime in 1938 as "infamous", as also giorgio almirante, historic leader of msi, had done before. he also referred to the italian social republic as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of "absolute evil", something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. as a result, alessandra mussolini, the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator benito mussolini, who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed social action.
in occasion of the 2006 general election, an ran within the house of freedoms, with new allies. the centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition the union. individually an received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. in july 2007 a group of splinters led by francesco storace formed the right, which was officially founded on 10 november. seven mps of an, including teodoro buontempo and daniela santanchè, joined the new party.
in november 2007 silvio berlusconi announced that forza italia would have soon merged or transformed into the people of freedom (pdl) party.
after the sudden fall of the second prodi government in january 2008, the breakup of the union and the subsequent political crisis which led to a fresh general election, berlusconi hinted that forza italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. in an atmosphere of reconciliation with gianfranco fini, berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties. finally, on 8 february, berlusconi and fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of the "people of freedom", allied with lega nord. after the victory of the pdl in the 2008 general election, an was merged into the pdl in early 2009.
national alliance's political program emphasized:
distinguishing itself from the msi, the party distanced itself from benito mussolini and fascism and made efforts to improve relations with jewish groups. with most hardliners leaving the party, it sought to present itself as a respectable conservative party and to join forces with forza italia in the european people's party and, eventually, in a united party of the centre-right.
although the party approved the market economy and held favourable views on liberalizations and the privatization of state industries, however an was to the left of forza italia on economic issues and sometimes supported statist policies. that is why the party was strong in rome and lazio, where most civil servants live. moreover, an presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, national identity and patriotism.
regarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of presidentialism and a plurality voting system, and came to support also federalism and to fully accept the alliance with lega nord, although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity.
gianfranco fini, a moderniser who saw nicolas sarkozy and david cameron as role-models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values and patriotism with a progressive approach in other areas such as stem cell research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and artificial insemination.
national alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organized:
in the party there was also a group named ethic-religious council, whose board members included gaetano rebecchini (founder, ex-dc), riccardo pedrizzi (president), franco tofoni (vice president), luigi gagliardi (secretary-general), alfredo mantovano, antonio mazzocchi and riccardo migliori. this was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. sometimes the group criticized gianfranco fini for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-dc members as publio fiori to leave the party. some members of the council, such as pedrizzi and mantovano were described as members of an unofficial catholic right faction.
the party had roughly 10–15% support across italy, having its strongholds in central and southern italy (lazio 18.6%, umbria 15.2%, marche 14.3%, abruzzo 14.3%, apulia 13.2%, sardinia 12.9%, tuscany 12.6% and campania 12.6% in the last general election), scoring badly in lombardy (10.2%) and sicily (10.9%), while competing in the north-east (friuli-venezia giulia 15.5% and veneto 11.3%).
the party had a good showing in the first general election to which it took part (13.5% in 1994) and reached 15.7% in 1996, when fini tried for the first time to replace silvio berlusconi as leader of the centre-right. from that moment the party suffered an electoral decline, but remained the third force of italian politics.
in the 2006 general election, the final election to which the party participated with its own list, an won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the chamber of deputies and 41 in the senate. in the 2008 general election the party had 90 deputies and 48 senators elected.
the electoral results of national alliance in the 10 most populated regions of italy are shown in the table below.

the arno is a river in the tuscany region of italy. it is the most important river of central italy after the tiber.
the river originates on mount falterona in the casentino area of the apennines, and initially takes a southward curve. the river turns to the west near arezzo passing through florence, empoli and pisa, flowing into the tyrrhenian sea at marina di pisa.
with a length of , it is the largest river in the region. it has many tributaries: sieve at long, bisenzio at , and the era, elsa, pesa, and pescia. the drainage basin amounts to more than and drains the waters of the following subbasins:
it crosses florence, where it passes below the ponte vecchio and the santa trinita bridge (built by bartolomeo ammanati but inspired by michelangelo). the river flooded this city regularly in historical times, most recently in 1966, with after rainfall of in badia agnano and in florence, in only 24 hours.
before pisa, the arno is crossed by the imperial canal at la botte. this water channel passes under the arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the lago di bientina, which was once the largest lake in tuscany before its reclamation.
the flow rate of the arno is irregular. it is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. at the point where the arno leaves the apennines, flow measurements can vary between . new dams built upstream of florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.
the flood on november 4, 1966 collapsed the embankment in florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books. new conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.
from latin "arnus" (pliny, "natural history" 3.50). the philologist hans krahe related this toponym on a paleo-european basis "*ar-n-", derived from the proto-indo-european root *"er-", "flow, move".

aveiro ( ) is a city and a municipality in portugal. in 2011, the population was 78,450, in an area of : it is the second most populous city in the centro region of portugal (after coimbra). along with the neighbouring city of ílhavo, aveiro is part of an urban agglomeration that includes 120,000 inhabitants, making it one of the most important populated regions by density in the centro region, and primary centre of the intermunicipal community of aveiro and baixo vouga. administratively, the president of the municipal government is josé ribau esteves, elected by coalition between the social democratic party and the democratic social centre, who governs the ten civil parishes ().
the presence of human settlement in the territory of aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.
for a long period aveiro was an important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping. it was a centre of salt exploration by the romans and trade since 26 january 959 (from the testament of countess mumadona dias to the "cenóbio" of guimarães). during this testament, mumadona dias also highlighted the ancient name for aveiro, referring to the monastery's lands in "alauario et salinas", literally, ""a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt"".
it was invaded by the moors and held until the 11th century, after which it became popular with portuguese royalty.
later, king joão i, on the advice of his son pedro, who was the donatary of aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.
king d. duarte conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the "feira de março" ("march fair"), today still an annual tradition.
the princess st. joana, daughter of afonso v lived in aveiro, entering the convent of jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 may 1490. during her life her presence brought attention to the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.
the first charter (foral) was conceded by manuel i of portugal on 4 august 1515, as indicated in the "livro de leituras novas de forais da estremadura". its geographic position along the aveiro river had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development.
by the beginning of the 15th century, there already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population. this included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway. in the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in metals and tiles, and creating a reef barrier at the atlantic ocean. the walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.
between the 16th and 17th centuries, the river's instability at the mouth (between the ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. this blow to the economy created a social and economic crisis, and resulted in the decrease in the population and emigration. it was at this time that the church of the miserícordia was constructed, during the philippine dynastic union.
in 1759, king josé i elevated the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the duke of aveiro (a title established in 1547 by joão iii), josé mascarenhas, to death. as a result, aveiro became known as nova bragança: it was later abandoned much later, and returned to aveiro. in 1774, by request of king josé, pope clement xiv instituted the diocese of aveiro.
in the 19th century, the aveirense were active during the liberal wars, and it was josé estêvão coelho de magalhães, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the ria, and development of transport, especially the railway line between lisbon and porto. it was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.
the municipality was elevated to the status of town, centered on the its principal church, consecrated to the archangel michael, today the location of the "praça da república" (having been demolished in 1835).
located on the shore of the atlantic ocean, aveiro is an industrial city with an important seaport.
the seat of the municipality is the city of aveiro, comprising the five urban parishes with about 73,003 inhabitants. the city of aveiro is also the capital of the district of aveiro, and the largest city in the baixo vouga intermunicipal community subregion.
aveiro is known as "the portuguese venice", due to its system of canals and boats similar to the italian city of venice.
aveiro has a warm-summer mediterranean climate influenced by its proximity to the atlantic ocean. the maritime influence causes a narrow temperature range resulting in summers averaging around in daytime temperatures, considerably lower than inland areas on the same parallel on the iberian peninsula. as typical of mediterranean climates, summers are dry and winters are wet. a coastal feature is that frosts are rare and never severe. the hottest temperature recorded was set in july. temperatures above are extremely occasional, and averages only a couple of times per annum.
administratively, the municipality is divided into 10 civil parishes ():
são jacinto is located on an eponymous peninsula, between the atlantic ocean and ria de aveiro. aveiro had 61,430 eligible voters in 2006.
aveiro's sister cities are:
aveiro is known for its production of salt and for its seaweed harvest, which is used for fertilizer in the area.
the region is also known for the preponderance of ceramics industries and commerce, a reflection of the regions advancements, resulting in a long productive tradition since the late roman, early medieval period (reflected in the ceramics kilns).
the city of aveiro has several shopping centers and malls (pingo doce shopping center, fórum aveiro, glicínias plaza (jumbo – auchan), aveiro's shopping center (continente & mediamarkt), aveiro's retail park and the oita shopping center). this city has lots of traditional commerce stores. the most central one being forum aveiro with clothes stores, restaurant zone, a book shop and a cinema.
the unemployment rate is very low (about 5%), sustained by a university and commerce.
the local economy is fed by a series of transport networks that cross the municipal boundaries.
regional gateways include air service through the aeródromo de aveiro/são jacinto (lpav) and the porto de aveiro (ílhavo/aveiro).
rail service includes service by alfa pendular (between lisbon and braga; lisbon and oporto; faro and oporto) and intercity (between lisbon and oporto as well as lisbon and guimarães) trains; suburban links through the urbanos do porto and, also, the linha do vouga, a narrow gauge railway to águeda and sernada do vouga.
the primary expressways and inter-regional thoroughfares include: a1 (between porto and lisbon); and the a25 (which links viseu, guarda and vilar formoso).
intercity buses connect aveiro with porto and lisbon several times a day.
"moliceiros" provide access along the ria for tourist visits, in addition to traditional fishing or recreational purposes, including regattas.
the architecture of aveiro is influenced by two phases: the pre-kingdom era, with a number of historical monuments; and the modernist movements resulting from the expansion of economy during the 19th-20th centuries.
the city's primary landmark is the 15th century monastery of jesus (), containing the tomb of king afonso v's daughter, st. joana (who died in 1490). the presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. in the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the "museu de santa joana", or simply, the museum of aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.
the abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the art novo and art deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and nationalist tendencies of the estado novo regime. the best of these in the university campus, where many the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.
there are several attractions in the city of aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beaches, including the "ílhavo ceramica de vista alegre" and the beaches of barra, costa nova do prado, and gafanha da nazaré.
aveiro is known in portugal for its traditional sweets, "ovos moles de aveiro" (pgi), "trouxas de ovos", both made from eggs. "raivas" are also a typical biscuit of aveiro.
the municipal holiday is 12 may, the day of joanna, princess of portugal.
the university of aveiro was created in 1973 and attracts thousands of students to the city. it is ranked as the 354th best university in the world in the "times" world university rankings, and the 2nd best in portugal.
the university has about 430 professors (with ph.d. degrees), 11,000 undergraduate students, and 1,300 post-graduate students.
sport clube beira-mar is an association football club. founded in 1922, it has a sports academy with various youth levels in sports including basketball and futsal. the club used to play at estádio municipal de aveiro, designed by portuguese architect tomás taveira for euro 2004, where it held two group matches.
the other long-established club in the city, os galitos, was founded in 1904 and houses a wide variety of sports. its rowers have represented portugal in international tournaments including the olympic games.

saint anthony or antony ( "antṓnios"; ;

amblypoda is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous mammals. they were considered a suborder of the primitive ungulate mammals and have since been shown to represent a polyphyletic group.
the amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs. the brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest rhinoceroses. these animals were descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size.
the amblypoda were confined to the paleocene and eocene periods and occurred in north america, asia (especially mongolia) and europe. the cheek teeth were short-crowned (brachyodont), with the tubercles more-or-less completely fused into transverse ridges, or cross-crests (lophodont type), and the total number of teeth was in one case the typical 44, but in another was fewer. the vertebra of the neck unite on nearly flat surfaces, the humerus had lost the foramen, or perforation, at the lower end, and the third trochanter to the femur may have also been wanting. in the forelimb, the upper and lower series of carpal (finger) bones scarcely alternated, but in the hind foot, the astragalus overlapped the cuboid, while the fibula, which was quite distinct from the tibia (as was the radius from the ulna in the forelimb), articulated with both astragalus and calcaneum.
the most generalized type was "coryphodon", representing the family coryphodontidae, from the lower eocene of europe and north america, in which there were 44 teeth and no horn-like excrescences on the long skull, while the femur had a third trochanter. the canines were somewhat elongated and were followed by a short gap in each jaw, and the cheek-teeth were adapted for succulent food. the length of the body reached about six feet in some cases.
in the middle eocene formations of north america occurred the more specialized "uintatherium" (or "dinoceras"), typifying the family uintatheriidae. uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, of which the elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. the dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p. 3/3·4, m. 3/3, the upper canines having been long sabre-like weapons, protected by a descending flange on each side of the lower front jaw.
in the basal eocene of north america, the amblypoda were represented by extremely primitive, five-toed, small ungulates such as "periptychus" and "pantolambda", each of these typifying a family. the full typical series of 44 teeth was developed in each, but whereas in the periptychidae, the upper molars were bunodont and tritubercular, in the pantolambdidae, they had assumed a selenodont structure. creodont characters were displayed in the skeleton.
few authorities recognize amblypoda in modern classifications. the following mammals were once considered part of this group:

amblygonite () is a fluorophosphate mineral, (li,na)alpo(f,oh), composed of lithium, sodium, aluminium, phosphate, fluoride and hydroxide. the mineral occurs in pegmatite deposits and is easily mistaken for albite and other feldspars. its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. amblygonite forms a series with "montebrasite", the low fluorine endmember. geologic occurrence is in granite pegmatites, high-temperature tin veins, and greisens. amblygonite occurs with spodumene, apatite, lepidolite, tourmaline, and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins. it contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. the chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of california and france.
the mineral was first discovered in saxony by august breithaupt in 1817, and named by him from the greek "amblus", blunt, and "gonia", angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. later it was found at montebras, creuse, france, and at hebron in maine; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities. it has been discovered in considerable quantity at pala in san diego county, california; caceres, spain; and the black hills of south dakota. the largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62×2.44×1.83 m and weighed ~102 tons.
transparent amblygonite has been faceted and used as a gemstone. as a gemstone set into jewelry it is vulnerable to breakage and abrasion from general wear, as its hardness and toughness are poor. the main sources for gem material are brazil and the united states. australia, france, germany, namibia, norway, and spain have also produced gem quality amblygonite.

amygdalin (from ancient greek: "" "almond") is a naturally occurring chemical compound best known for being falsely promoted as a cancer cure. it is found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of apricots, bitter almonds, apples, peaches, and plums.
amygdalin is classified as a cyanogenic glycoside because each amygdalin molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion by the action of a beta-glucosidase. eating amygdalin will cause it to release cyanide in the human body, and may lead to cyanide poisoning.
since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named laetrile have been promoted as alternative cancer treatments, often under the misnomer vitamin b (neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a vitamin). scientific study has found them to be clinically ineffective in treating cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth due to cyanide poisoning. the promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery, and as "the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history".
amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside derived from the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. amygdalin and prunasin are common among plants of the family rosaceae, particularly the genus "prunus", poaceae (grasses), fabaceae (legumes), and in other food plants, including flaxseed and manioc. within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze it are stored in separate locations so that they will mix in response to tissue damage. this provides a natural defense system.
amygdalin is contained in stone fruit kernels, such as almonds, apricot (14,000 mg/kg), peach (6,800 mg/kg), and plum (4,000–17,500 mg/kg depending on variety), and also in the seeds of the apple (3,000 mg/kg). benzaldehyde released from amygdalin provides a bitter flavor. because of a difference in a recessive gene called "sweet kernal [sk]", less amygdalin is present in nonbitter (or sweet) almond than bitter almond. in one study, bitter almond amygdalin concentrations ranged from 33,000–54,000 mg/kg depending on variety; semibitter varieties averaged 994 mg/kg and sweet varieties averaged 63 mg/kg with significant variability based on variety and growing region.
for one method of isolating amygdalin, the stones are removed from the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. the kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, amygdalin is precipitated as minute white crystals. natural amygdalin has the ("r")-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the ("s")-epimer is called neoamygdalin. although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the ("r")-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.
amygdalin is hydrolyzed by intestinal β-glucosidase (emulsin) and amygdalin beta-glucosidase (amygdalase) to give gentiobiose and -mandelonitrile. gentiobiose is further hydrolyzed to give glucose, whereas mandelonitrile (the cyanohydrin of benzaldehyde) decomposes to give benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. hydrogen cyanide in sufficient quantities (allowable daily intake: ~0.6 mg) causes cyanide poisoning (fatal oral dose: 0.6–1.5 mg/kg).
laetrile (patented 1961) is a simpler semisynthetic version of amygdalin. laetrile is synthesized from amygdalin by hydrolysis. the usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels ("prunus armeniaca"). the name is derived from the separate words "laevarotatory" and "mandelonitrile". laevarotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to the portion of the molecule from which cyanide is released by decomposition.
a 500 mg laetrile tablet may contain between 5–51 mg of hydrogen cyanide per gram.
like amygdalin, laetrile is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) and in the intestine (enzymatically) to -glucuronic acid and -mandelonitrile; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes cyanide poisoning.
claims for laetrile were based on three different hypotheses: the first hypothesis proposed that cancerous cells contained copious beta-glucosidases, which release hcn from laetrile via hydrolysis. normal cells were reportedly unaffected, because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases and high concentrations of rhodanese, which converts hcn to the less toxic thiocyanate. later, however, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-glucosidases and similar amounts of rhodanese.
the second proposed that, after ingestion, amygdalin was hydrolyzed to mandelonitrile, transported intact to the liver and converted to a beta-glucuronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidases to release mandelonitrile and then hcn. mandelonitrile, however, dissociates to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, and cannot be stabilized by glycosylation.
finally, the third asserted that laetrile is the discovered vitamin b-17, and further suggests that cancer is a result of "b-17 deficiency". it postulated that regular dietary administration of this form of laetrile would, therefore, actually prevent all incidence of cancer. there is no evidence supporting this conjecture in the form of a physiologic process, nutritional requirement, or identification of any deficiency syndrome. the term "vitamin b-17" is not recognized by committee on nomenclature of the american institute of nutrition vitamins. ernst t. krebs branded laetrile as a vitamin in order to have it classified as a nutritional supplement rather than as a pharmaceutical.
amygdalin was first isolated in 1830 from bitter almond seeds ("prunus dulcis") by pierre-jean robiquet and antoine boutron-charlard. liebig and wöhler found three hydrolysis products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide, hcn). later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into -glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, -glucose, and ammonia.
in 1845 amygdalin was used as a cancer treatment in russia, and in the 1920s in the united states, but it was considered too poisonous. in the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative, and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.
the u.s. food and drug administration prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977. thereafter, 27 u.s. states legalized the use of amygdalin within those states.
in a 1977 controlled, blinded trial, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.
subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. the memorial sloan–kettering cancer center (mskcc) concluded that "laetrile showed no beneficial effects." mistakes in an earlier mskcc press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by ralph moss, former public affairs official of mskcc who had been fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile. these mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but nicholas wade in "science" stated that "even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate." the results from these studies were published all together.
a 2015 systematic review from the cochrane collaboration found:
the authors also recommended, on ethical and scientific grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.
given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration or the european commission.
the u.s. national institutes of health evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer. for example, a 1982 trial by the mayo clinic of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient. the authors reported that "the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range."
the study concluded "patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. amygdalin (laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".
additionally, "no controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported."
the side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. these symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy upper eyelid, trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.
the european food safety agency's panel on contaminants in the food chain has studied the potential toxicity of the amygdalin in apricot kernels. the panel reported, "if consumers follow the recommendations of websites that promote consumption of apricot kernels, their exposure to cyanide will greatly exceed" the dose expected to be toxic. the panel also reported that acute cyanide toxicity had occurred in adults who had consumed 20 or more kernels and that in children "five or more kernels appear to be toxic".
advocates for laetrile assert that there is a conspiracy between the us food and drug administration, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical community, including the american medical association and the american cancer society, to exploit the american people, and especially cancer patients.
advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a "holistic" nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.
despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a "pain-free" treatment of cancer as an alternative to surgery and chemotherapy that have significant side effects. the use of laetrile led to a number of deaths.
the fda and ama crackdown, begun in the 1970s, effectively escalated prices on the black market, played into the conspiracy narrative and enabled unscrupulous profiteers to foster multimillion-dollar smuggling empires.
some north american cancer patients have traveled to mexico for treatment with the substance, for example at the oasis of hope hospital in tijuana. the actor steve mcqueen died in mexico following surgery to remove a stomach tumor having previously undergone extended treatment for pleural mesothelioma (a cancer associated with asbestos exposure) under the care of william d. kelley, a de-licensed dentist and orthodontist who claimed to have devised a cancer treatment involving pancreatic enzymes, 50 daily vitamins and minerals, frequent body shampoos, enemas, and a specific diet as well as laetrile.
laetrile advocates in the united states include dean burk, a former chief chemist of the national cancer institute cytochemistry laboratory, and national arm wrestling champion jason vale, who falsely claimed that his kidney and pancreatic cancers were cured by eating apricot seeds. vale was convicted in 2004 for, among other things, fraudulently marketing laetrile as a cancer cure. the court also found that vale had made at least $500,000 from his fraudulent sales of laetrile.
in the 1970s, court cases in several states challenged the fda's authority to restrict access to what they claimed are potentially lifesaving drugs. more than twenty states passed laws making the use of laetrile legal. after the unanimous supreme court ruling in "rutherford v. united states" which established that interstate transport of the compound was illegal, usage fell off dramatically. the us food and drug administration continues to seek jail sentences for vendors marketing laetrile for cancer treatment, calling it a "highly toxic product that has not shown any effect on treating cancer."

running amok, sometimes referred to as simply amok or gone amok, also spelled amuk, from the southeast asian austronesian languages (especially malaysian and indonesian), is "an episode of sudden mass assault against people or objects usually by a single individual following a period of brooding that has traditionally been regarded as occurring especially in malay culture but is now increasingly viewed as psychopathological behavior". the syndrome of "amok" is found in the "diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders" (dsm-iv tr). the phrase is often used in a less serious manner when describing something that is wildly out of control or causing a frenzy (e.g., a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be termed as "running amok").
amok originated from the malaysian/indonesian word "meng-âmuk", which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge". according to malaysian and indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief. they believed that amok was caused by the "hantu belian", which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. as a result of the belief, those in indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.
although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic culture-bound syndrome in the cultures of malaysia, indonesia and brunei. in a typical case of "running amok", an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself. amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing suicide, eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized. those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.
an early western description of the practice appears in the journals of captain james cook, a british explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."
a widely accepted explanation links amok with male honor (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).
running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.
"running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities. an episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. the slang terms "going postal" or "going ballistic" are similar in scope.
police describe such an event as a killing spree. if the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "suicide by cop".
amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome, which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. other reported culture-bound syndromes are latah and koro. amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of dissociative disorders (cross-cultural variant).
in 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill. the modern dsm-iv method of classification of mental disorders contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.
early travelers in asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.
an example would be during the battle of bukit chandu in singapore during wwii when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the malay regiment, led by adnan saidi, charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading japanese army. they continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.
this form of amok appears to resemble the germanic "berserker", the "cafard" or "cathard" (polynesia), "mal de pelea" (puerto rico), and "iich'aa" (navaho).
in contemporary indonesia, the term "amok" ("amuk") generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. laurens van der post experienced the phenomenon in the east indies and wrote in 1955:
in the philippines, "amok" also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. in 1876, the spanish governor-general of the philippines josé malcampo coined the term "juramentado" for the behavior (from "juramentar" – "to take an oath"), surviving into modern philippine languages as "huramentado". it has historically been linked with the moro people of mindanao, particularly in the sulu archipelago, in connection with societal and cultural pressures.
norse berserkers and the zulu battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.
according to the "encyclopædia britannica" eleventh edition, some notable cases have occurred among the rajputs. in 1634, the eldest son of the raja of jodhpur ran amok at the court of shah jahan, failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. during the 18th century, again, at hyderabad (sind), two envoys, sent by the jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.

the apostles' creed (latin: "symbolum apostolorum" or "symbolum apostolicum"), sometimes titled the apostolic creed or the symbol of the apostles, is an early statement of christian belief—a creed or "symbol". it is widely used by a number of christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of western tradition, including the catholic church, lutheranism and anglicanism. it is also used by presbyterians, moravians, methodists and congregationalists.
the apostles' creed is trinitarian in structure with sections affirming belief in god the father, jesus christ his son and the holy spirit. the apostles' creed was based on christian theological understanding of the canonical gospels, the letters of the new testament and to a lesser extent the old testament. its basis appears to be the old roman creed known also as the old roman symbol.
because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some christological issues defined in the nicene and other christian creeds. it thus says nothing explicitly about the divinity of either jesus or the holy spirit. nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.
the earliest known mention of the expression "apostles' creed" occurs in a letter of ad 390 from a synod in milan and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the holy spirit, each of the twelve apostles contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.
the word "symbolum", standing alone, appears around the middle of the third century in the correspondence of st. cyprian and st. firmilian, the latter in particular speaking of the creed as the "symbol of the trinity", and recognizing it as an integral part of the rite of baptism.
the title "symbolum apostolicum" (symbol or creed of the apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by ambrose, from a council in milan to pope siricius in about ad 390 "let them give credit to the creed of the apostles, which the roman church has always kept and preserved undefiled". but what existed at that time was not what is now known as the apostles' creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase "maker of heaven and earth", a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.
the account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the apostles' creed, as having been jointly created by the apostles under the inspiration of the holy spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.
the earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on , part of the great commission, and it has been argued that this earlier text was already in written form by the late 2nd century (c. 180).
while the individual statements of belief that are included in the apostles' creed – even those not found in the old roman symbol – are found in various writings by irenaeus, tertullian, novatian, marcellus, rufinus, ambrose, augustine, nicetas, and eusebius gallus, the earliest appearance of what we know as the apostles' creed was in the "de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" (""excerpt from individual canonical books"") of st. pirminius (migne, "patrologia latina" 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714. bettenson and maunder state that it is first from "dicta abbatis pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" ("idem quod excarpsus", excerpt), c. 750. this longer creed seems to have arisen in what is now france and spain. charlemagne imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in rome, where the old roman symbol or similar formulas had survived for centuries. it has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.
as can be seen from various creeds all quoted in full below, although the original greek and latin creeds both specifically refer to “the resurrection of the "flesh"” (σαρκὸς ἀνάστασιν and "carnis resurrectionem"), the versions used by several churches, like the roman catholic church, the church of england, lutheran churches and methodist churches, talk more generally of “the resurrection of the "body"”.
some have suggested that the apostles' creed was spliced together with phrases from the new testament. for instance, the phrase "descendit ad inferos" ("he descended into hell") echoes , "κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς" ("he descended into the lower earthly regions"). it is of interest that this phrase first appeared in one of the two versions of rufinus in ad 390 and then did not appear again in any version of the creed until ad 650.
this phrase and that on the communion of saints are articles found in the apostles' creed, but not in the old roman symbol nor in the nicene creed.
musical settings of the symbolum apostolorum as a motet are rare. the french composer le brung published one latin setting in 1540, and the spanish composer fernando de las infantas published two in 1578.
more recently, in 1979 john michael talbot, a third order franciscan, composed and recorded "creed" on his album, "the lord's supper". in 1986 graham kendrick published the popular "we believe in god the father", closely based on the apostles' creed.
rich mullins and beaker also composed a musical setting titled "creed", released on mullins' 1993 album "a liturgy, a legacy, & a ragamuffin band". notably, mullins' version replaces "one holy catholic church" with "one holy church".
the song "creed" on petra's 1990 album "beyond belief" is loosely based on the apostles' creed.
gia publications published a hymn text in 1991 directly based on the apostles' creed, called "i believe in god almighty." it has been sung to hymn tunes from wales, the netherlands, and ireland.
in 2014 hillsong released a version of the apostles' creed under the title "this i believe (the creed)" on their album "no other name". keith getty and kristyn getty released an expression of the apostles' creed under the title "we believe (apostle's creed)" on their 2016 album "facing a task unfinished".

the international consultation on english texts (icet), a first inter-church ecumenical group that undertook the writing of texts for use by english-speaking christians in common, published "prayers we have in common" (fortress press, 1970,1971,1975). its version of the apostles' creed was adopted by several churches.
the english language liturgical consultation (ellc). a successor body to the international consultation on english texts (icet), published in 1988 a revised translation of the apostles' creed. it avoided the word "his" in relation to god and spoke of jesus christ as "god's only son" instead of "his only son". in the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun "he" with the relative "who", and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the creed as a series of separate statements. in the same line it removed the words "the power of". it explained its rationale for making these changes and for preserving other controverted expressions in the 1988 publication "praying together", with which it presented its new version:
the initial (1970) english official translation of the roman missal of the catholic church adopted the icet version, as did catechetical texts such as the "catechism of the catholic church".
in 2008 the catholic church published a new english translation of the texts of the mass of the roman rite, use of which came into force at the end of 2011. it included the following translation of the apostles' creed:
in its discussion of the contents of the creed, the "catechism of the catholic church" presents it in the traditional division into twelve articles:
the same division into twelve articles is found also in anabaptist catechesis:
pelbartus ladislaus of temesvár gives a slightly different division, assigning one phrase to each apostle: peter (no. 1), john (no. 2), james, son of zebedee (no. 3), andrew (no. 4), philip (no. 5a: descendit ad infernos...), thomas (no. 5b: ascendit ad caelos...), bartholomew (no. 6), matthew (no. 7), james, son of alphaeus (no. 8), simon (no. 9), jude (no. 10), matthias (no. 11–12).
in the church of england there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the "book of common prayer" (1662) and that of "common worship" (2000).
book of common prayer, 1662
<poem>i believe in god the father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth:
and in jesus christ his only son our lord,
who was conceived by the holy ghost,
born of the virgin mary,
suffered under pontius pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried:
he descended into hell;
the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and sitteth on the right hand of god the father almighty;
from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
i believe in the holy ghost;
the holy catholick church;
the communion of saints;
the forgiveness of sins;
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting.
amen.</poem>
common worship
the publication "evangelical lutheran worship" published by augsburg fortress, is the primary worship resource for the evangelical lutheran church in america, the largest lutheran denomination in the united states, and the evangelical lutheran church in canada. it presents the official elca version, footnoting the phrase "he descended to the dead" to indicate an alternative reading: "or ‘he descended into hell,’ another translation of this text in widespread use".
the text is as follows:
the church of denmark still uses the phrase "we renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings" as the beginning of this creed, before the line "we believe in god etc." this is mostly due to the influence of the danish pastor grundtvig. see .
the united methodists commonly incorporate the apostles' creed into their worship services. the version which is most often used is located at no. 881 in the "united methodist hymnal", one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers john wesley and charles wesley, founders of methodism. it is notable for omitting the line "he descended into hell", but is otherwise very similar to the book of common prayer version. the 1989 hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version, which includes "he descended to the dead."
however, when the methodist episcopal church was organized in the united states in 1784, john wesley sent the new american church a sunday service which included the phrase "he descended into hell" in the text of the apostles' creed. . it is clear that wesley intended american methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the creed.
the "united methodist hymnal" also contains (at #882) what it terms the "ecumenical version" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the international committee on english texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the english language liturgical consultation (1987). this form of the apostles' creed can be found incorporated into the eucharistic and baptismal liturgies in the hymnal and in "the united methodist book of worship", and hence it is growing in popularity and use. the word "catholic" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical christian church.
the apostles' creed is used in its direct form or in interrogative forms by western christian communities in several of their liturgical rites, in particular those of baptism and the eucharist.
the apostles' creed, whose present form is similar to the baptismal creed used in rome in the third and fourth centuries, actually developed from questions addressed to those seeking baptism. the catholic church still today uses an interrogative form of it in the rite of baptism (for both children and adults). in the official english translation (icel, 1974) the minister of baptism asks:
to each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers "i do." then the celebrant says:
and all respond: amen.
the presbyterian church of aotearoa new zealand uses the apostles' creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase "born of the virgin mary".
the episcopal church in the united states of america uses the apostles' creed as a baptismal covenant for those who are to receive the rite of baptism. the apostles' creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, "do you believe in god the father (god the son, god the holy spirit)?"
the church of england likewise asks the candidates, sponsors and congregation to recite the apostles' creed in answer to similar interrogations, in which it avoids using the word "god" of the son and the holy spirit, asking instead: "do you believe and trust in his son jesus christ?", and "do you believe and trust in the holy spirit?" moreover, "where there are strong pastoral reasons", it allows use of an alternative formula in which the interrogations, while speaking of "god the son" and "god the holy spirit", are more elaborate but are not based on the apostles' creed, and the response in each case is: "i believe and trust in him." the "book of common prayer" may also be used, which in its rite of baptism has the minister recite the apostles' creed in interrogative form. asking the godparents or, in the case "of such as are of riper years", the candidate: "dost thou believe in god the father ..." the response is: "all this i stedfastly believe."
lutherans following the "lutheran service book" (lutheran church–missouri synod and the lutheran church–canada), like roman catholics, use the apostles' creed during the sacrament of baptism:
following each question, the candidate answers: "yes, i believe". if the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.
for elca lutherans who use the evangelical lutheran worship book, the apostles' creed appears during the sacrament of holy baptism rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.
methodists use the apostles' creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the church's sacramental act. for infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. for the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.
since the 2002 edition, the apostles' creed is included in the roman missal as an alternative, with the indication, "instead of the niceno-constantinopolitan creed, especially during lent and easter time, the baptismal symbol of the roman church, known as the apostles' creed, may be used." previously the nicene creed was the only profession of faith that the missal gave for use at mass, except in masses for children; but in some countries use of the apostles' creed was already permitted.
the apostles' creed is used in anglican services of matins and evening prayer (evensong). it is invoked after the recitation or singing of the canticles, and is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the quire.
before the 1955 simplification of the rubrics of the roman breviary by pope pius xii, the apostles' creed was recited at the beginning of matins and prime, at the end of compline, and in some "preces" (a series of versicles and responses preceded by "kyrie, eleison" ("lord, have mercy") and the our father) of prime and compline on certain days during advent and lent.

amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (a proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) a pair of amicable numbers constitutes an aliquot sequence of period 2. a related concept is that of a perfect number, which is a number that equals the sum of "its own" proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as sociable numbers.
the smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284). they are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.
the first ten amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368), (10744, 10856), (12285, 14595), (17296, 18416), (63020, 76084), and (66928, 66992). . (also see and )
amicable numbers were known to the pythagoreans, who credited them with many mystical properties. a general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the iraqi mathematician thābit ibn qurra (826–901). other arab mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are al-majriti (died 1007), al-baghdadi (980–1037), and al-fārisī (1260–1320). the iranian mathematician muhammad baqir yazdi (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to descartes. much of the work of eastern mathematicians in this area has been forgotten.
thābit ibn qurra's formula was rediscovered by fermat (1601–1665) and descartes (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by euler (1707–1783). it was extended further by borho in 1972. fermat and descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to arab mathematicians. euler also discovered dozens of new pairs. the second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage b. nicolò i. paganini (not to be confused with the composer and violinist), having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.
by 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10 in 1970, to 10 in 1986, 10 in 1993, 10 in 2015, and to 10 in 2016.
, there are over 1,223,393,596 known amicable pairs.
while these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.
in particular, the two rules below produce only even amicable pairs, so they are of no interest for the open problem of finding amicable pairs coprime to 210 = 2·3·5·7, while over 1000 pairs coprime to 30 = 2·3·5 are known [garcía, pedersen & te riele (2003), sándor & crstici (2004)].
the thābit ibn qurra theorem is a method for discovering amicable numbers invented in the ninth century by the arab mathematician thābit ibn qurra.
it states that if
where is an integer and , , and are prime numbers, then and are a pair of amicable numbers. this formula gives the pairs for , for , and for , but no other such pairs are known. numbers of the form are known as thabit numbers. in order for ibn qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of .
to establish the theorem, thâbit ibn qurra proved nine lemmas divided into two groups. the first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. the second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.
"euler's rule" is a generalization of the thâbit ibn qurra theorem. it states that if
where are integers and , , and are prime numbers, then and are a pair of amicable numbers. thābit ibn qurra's theorem corresponds to the case . euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for with no others being known. euler (1747 & 1750) overall found 58 new pairs to make all the by then existing pairs into 61.
let (, ) be a pair of amicable numbers with , and write and where is the greatest common divisor of and . if and are both coprime to and square free then the pair (, ) is said to be regular , otherwise it is called irregular or exotic. if (, ) is regular and and have and prime factors respectively, then is said to be of type .
for example, with , the greatest common divisor is and so and . therefore, is regular of type .
an amicable pair is twin if there are no integers between and belonging to any other amicable pair .
in every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both even or both odd. it is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. however, amicable numbers where the two members have different smallest prime factors do exist: there are seven such pairs known. also, every known pair shares at least one common prime factor. it is not known whether a pair of coprime amicable numbers exists, though if any does, the product of the two must be greater than 10. also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula.
in 1955, paul erdős showed that the density of amicable numbers, relative to the positive integers, was 0.
according to the sum of amicable pairs conjecture, as the number of the amicable numbers approaches infinity, the percentage of the sums of the amicable pairs divisible by ten approaches 100% .
amicable numbers formula_1 satisfy formula_2 and formula_3 which can be written together as formula_4. this can be generalized to larger tuples, say formula_5, where we require
for example, (1980, 2016, 2556) is an amicable triple , and (3270960, 3361680, 3461040, 3834000) is an amicable quadruple .
amicable multisets are defined analogously and generalizes this a bit further .
sociable numbers are the numbers in cyclic lists of numbers (with a length greater than 2) where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the preceding number. for example, formula_7 are sociable numbers of order 4.
the aliquot sequence can be represented as a directed graph, formula_8, for a given integer formula_9, where formula_10 denotes the
sum of the proper divisors of formula_11.
cycles in formula_8 represent sociable numbers within the interval formula_13. two special cases are loops that represent perfect numbers and cycles of length two that represent amicable pairs.

agar (pronounced , sometimes ) or agar-agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from red algae.
agar is a mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin. it forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and is released on boiling. these algae are known as agarophytes, and belong to the rhodophyta (red algae) phylum.
agar has been used as an ingredient in desserts throughout asia, and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work. agar can be used as a laxative, an appetite suppressant, a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics.
the gelling agent in agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from "tengusa" ("gelidiaceae") and "ogonori" ("gracilaria"). for commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from "ogonori". in chemical terms, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose.
agar may have been discovered in japan in 1658 by mino tarōzaemon (), an innkeeper in current fushimi-ku, kyoto who, according to legend, was said to have discarded surplus seaweed soup and noticed that it gelled later after a winter night's freezing. over the following centuries, agar became a common gelling agent in several southeast asian cuisines.
agar was first subjected to chemical analysis in 1859 by the french chemist anselme payen, who had obtained agar from the marine algae "gelidium corneum".
beginning in the late 19th century, agar began to be used heavily as a solid medium for growing various microbes. agar was first described for use in microbiology in 1882 by the german microbiologist walther hesse, an assistant working in robert koch's laboratory, on the suggestion of his wife fannie hesse. agar quickly supplanted gelatin as the base of microbiological media, due to its higher melting temperature, allowing microbes to be grown at higher temperatures without the media liquefying.
with its newfound use in microbiology, agar production quickly increased. this production centered on japan, which produced most of the world's agar until world war ii. however, with the outbreak of world war ii, many nations were forced to establish domestic agar industries in order to continue microbiological research. around the time of world war ii, approximately 2,500 tons of agar were produced annually. by the mid-1970s, production worldwide had increased dramatically to approximately 10,000 tons each year. since then, production of agar has fluctuated due to unstable and sometimes over-utilized seaweed populations.
the word "agar" comes from agar-agar, the malay name for red algae ("gigartina", "gracilaria") from which the jelly is produced. it is also known as kanten () (from the phrase "kan-zarashi tokoroten" () or “cold-exposed agar”), japanese isinglass, ceylon moss or jaffna moss. "gracilaria lichenoides" is specifically referred to as agal-agal or ceylon agar.
agar consists of a mixture of two polysaccharides: agarose and agaropectin, with agarose making up about 70% of the mixture. agarose is a linear polymer, made up of repeating units of agarobiose, a disaccharide made up of d-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-l-galactopyranose. agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts, and is made up of alternating units of d-galactose and l-galactose heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate.
agar exhibits hysteresis, melting at 85 °c (358 k, 185 °f) and solidifying from 32–40 °c (305–313 k, 90–104 °f). this property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37 °c), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.
agar-agar is a natural vegetable gelatin counterpart. white and semi-translucent, it is sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. it can be used to make jellies, puddings, and custards. for making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. sweetener, flavouring, colouring, fruit or vegetables are then added and the liquid is poured into molds to be served as desserts and vegetable aspics, or incorporated with other desserts, such as a jelly layer in a cake.
agar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. its bulking quality has been behind fad diets in asia, for example the "kanten" (the japanese word for agar-agar) diet. once ingested, "kanten" triples in size and absorbs water. this results in the consumers feeling fuller. this diet has recently received some press coverage in the united states as well. the diet has shown promise in obesity studies.
one use of agar in japanese cuisine (wagashi) is "anmitsu", a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. it is also the main ingredient in "mizu yōkan", another popular japanese food.
in philippine cuisine, it is used to make the jelly bars in the various gulaman refreshments or desserts such as "sago gulaman", "buko pandan", "agar flan", "halo-halo", and the black and red "gulaman" used in various fruit salads.
in vietnamese cuisine, jellies made of flavored layers of agar agar, called "thạch", are a popular dessert, and are often made in ornate molds for special occasions. in indian cuisine, agar agar is known as "china grass" and is used for making desserts. in burmese cuisine, a sweet jelly known as "kyauk kyaw" is made from agar.
in russia, it is used in addition or as a replacement to pectin in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. another use of agar-agar is in "ptich'ye moloko" (bird's milk), a rich jellified custard (or soft meringue) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets. agar-agar may also be used as the gelling agent in gel clarification, a culinary technique used to clarify stocks, sauces, and other liquids.
mexico has traditional candies made out of agar gelatin, most of them in colorful, half-circle shapes that resemble a melon or watermelon fruit slice, and commonly covered with sugar. they are known in spanish as "dulce de agar" (agar sweets)
agar-agar is an allowed nonorganic/nonsynthetic additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, texturizer, moisturizer, emulsifier, flavor enhancer, and absorbent in certified organic foods.
an agar plate or petri dish is used to provide a growth medium using a mix of agar and other nutrients in which microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, can be cultured and observed under the microscope. agar is indigestible for many organisms so that microbial growth does not affect the gel used and it remains stable. agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the microbes. many specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others. agar is often dispensed using a sterile media dispenser.
as a gel, an agar or agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. the gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's "point of view") can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.
a common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized, whereas non-motile species will show growth only along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.
another setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay, whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. as a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.
research grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). nutrient and vitamin supplementation for "arabidopsis thaliana" is standard across most experimental conditions. murashige & skoog (ms) nutrient mix and gamborg's b5 vitamin mix in general are used. a 1.0% agar/0.44% ms+vitamin dho solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.
when using agar, within any growth medium, it is important to know that the solidification of the agar is ph-dependent. the optimal range for solidification is between 5.4-5.7. usually, the application of koh is needed to increase the ph to this range. a general guideline is about 600 µl 0.1m koh per 250 ml gm. this entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an autoclave.
this medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of gm, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often-polar hormones. this hormone/gm solution can be spread across the surface of petri dishes sown with germinated and/or etiolated seedlings.
experiments with the moss "physcomitrella patens", however, have shown that choice of the gelling agent — agar or gelrite - does influence phytohormone sensitivity of the plant cell culture.
agar is used:
gelidium agar is used primarily for bacteriological plates. gracilaria agar is used mainly in food applications.
in 2016, amam, a japanese company, developed a prototype for agar-based commercial packaging system called agar plasticity, intended as a replacement for oil-based plastic packaging.

acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low ph). it can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.
"acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog, cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. distilled water, once carbon dioxide is removed, has a neutral ph of 7. liquids with a ph less than 7 are acidic, and those with a ph greater than 7 are alkaline. "clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic ph, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid according to the following reaction:
carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of carbonate and hydronium ions:
unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its ph (acidity level). a common example is nitric acid produced by electric discharge in the atmosphere such as lightning. acid deposition as an environmental issue (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than .
the corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by john evelyn, who remarked upon the poor condition of the arundel marbles.
since the industrial revolution, emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased. in 1852, robert angus smith was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in manchester, england.
in the late 1960s scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon. the term "acid rain" was coined in 1872 by robert angus smith. canadian harold harvey was among the first to research a "dead" lake. at first the main focus in research lay on local effects of acid rain. waldemar christofer brøgger was the first to acknowledge long-distance transportation of pollutants crossing borders from the united kingdom to norway. public awareness of acid rain in the us increased in the 1970s after "the new york times" published reports from the hubbard brook experimental forest in new hampshire of the harmful environmental effects that result from it.
occasional ph readings in rain and fog water of well below 2.4 have been reported in industrialized areas. industrial acid rain is a substantial problem in china and russia and areas downwind from them. these areas all burn sulfur-containing coal to generate heat and electricity.
the problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. the use of tall smokestacks to reduce local pollution has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation. often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (because of their higher rainfall). an example of this effect is the low ph of rain which falls in scandinavia.
the earliest report about acid rain in the united states was from the chemical evidence from hubbard brook valley. in 1972, a group of scientists including gene likens discovered the rain that was deposited at white mountains of new hampshire was acidic. the ph of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at hubbard brook. the hubbard brook ecosystem study followed up with a series of research that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain. acid rain that mixed with stream water at hubbard brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils. the result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. in 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of norris brook, new hampshire, and observed the change in species' behaviors. there was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the food web complexity.
in 1980, the us congress passed an acid deposition act. this act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the national acidic precipitation assessment program (napap). napap looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. it enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. it looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. it also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.
from the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence napap activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents. for the us government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of napap were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.
in 1981, the national academy of sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain. president ronald reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain until his personal visit to canada and confirmed that canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in midwest of us. reagan honored the agreement to canadian prime minister pierre trudeau’s enforcement of anti-pollution regulation. in 1982, us president ronald reagan commissioned william nierenberg to serve on the national science board. nierenberg selected scientists including gene likens to serve on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. in 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. white house office of science and technology policy reviewed the draft report and sent fred singer’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. the panelists revealed rejections against singer’s positions and submitted the report to nierenberg in april. in may 1983, the house of representatives voted against legislation that aimed to control sulfur emissions. there was a debate about whether nierenberg delayed to release the report. nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the house's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.
in 1991, the us national acid precipitation assessment program (napap) provided its first assessment of acid rain in the united states. it reported that 5% of new england lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. they noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support brook trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. subsequent "reports to congress" have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.
meanwhile, in 1990, the us congress passed a series of amendments to the clean air act. title iv of these amendments established the a cap and trade system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. title iv called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of so emissions from power plants, close to a 50% reduction. it was implemented in two phases. phase i began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. one power plant in new england (merrimack) was in phase i. four other plants (newington, mount tom, brayton point, and salem harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. phase ii began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.
during the 1990s, research continued. on march 10, 2005, the epa issued the clean air interstate rule (cair). this rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. cair will permanently cap emissions of so and no in the eastern united states. when fully implemented, cair will reduce so emissions in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia by over 70% and no emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.
overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. since the 1990s, so emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the pacific research institute, acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976. conventional regulation was used in the european union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in so emissions during the same time period.
in 2007, total so emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.
in 2007 the epa estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted. forbes says: "in 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the george w. bush administration's clean air interstate rule, so2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons."
the term citizen science can be traced back as far as january 1989 and a campaign by the audubon society to measure acid rain. scientist muki haklay cites in a policy report for the wilson center entitled 'citizen science and policy: a european perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by r. kerson in the magazine mit technology review from january 1989. quoting from the wilson center report: "the new form of engagement in science received the name "citizen science". the first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the us collected rain samples to assist the audubon society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. the volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. the information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."
the most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form nitric acid are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur compounds. 70 tg(s) per year in the form of so comes from fossil fuel combustion and industry, 2.8 tg(s) from wildfires and 7–8 tg(s) per year from volcanoes.
the principal natural phenomena that contribute acid-producing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes. thus, for example, fumaroles from the laguna caliente crater of poás volcano create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a ph of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements. acid-producing gasses are also created by biological processes that occur on the land, in wetlands, and in the oceans. the major biological source of sulfur compounds is dimethyl sulfide.
nitric acid in rainwater is an important source of fixed nitrogen for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as lightning.
acidic deposits have been detected in glacial ice thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.
soils of coniferous forests are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.
the principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as electricity generation, factories, and motor vehicles. electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollution responsible for acidic rain. the gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. in the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. however, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.
combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. they are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid.
in the gas phase sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the hydroxyl radical via an intermolecular reaction:
which is followed by:
in the presence of water, sulfur trioxide (so) is converted rapidly to sulfuric acid:
nitrogen dioxide reacts with oh to form nitric acid:
when clouds are present, the loss rate of so is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. this is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.
sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, hydrolyses in a series of equilibrium reactions:
there are a large number of aqueous reactions that oxidize sulfur from s(iv) to s(vi), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. the most important oxidation reactions are with ozone, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by iron and manganese in the cloud droplets).
wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the earth's surface. this can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.
acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. this can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition. this occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.
acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.
both the lower ph and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. at ph lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower ph can kill adult fish. as lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the brook trout in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the adirondack mountains of the united states. however, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. the united states environmental protection agency's (epa) website states: "of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams". lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.
soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low ph and are killed. the enzymes of these microbes are denatured (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. the hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins, such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium.
soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as sugar maple (acer saccharum).
adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. high altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.
other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. in cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the ph stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. when calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.
acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. acid rain can cause the ocean's ph to fall, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their exoskeletons that they need to survive. these coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.
coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to ph drop, because the calcium carbonate, core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low ph) solutions.
acid rain does not directly affect human health. the acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air contribute to heart and lung problems including asthma and bronchitis.
acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as limestone and marble, that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.
the effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. acid rain also increases the corrosion rate of metals, in particular iron, steel, copper and bronze.
places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern europe from poland northward into scandinavia, the eastern third of the united states, and southeastern canada. other affected areas include the southeastern coast of china and taiwan.
many coal-firing power stations use flue-gas desulfurization (fgd) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. for a typical coal-fired power station, fgd will remove 95% or more of the so in the flue gases. an example of fgd is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. a wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. the calcium carbonate of the limestone produces ph-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. that is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.
in some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as gypsum when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. in others, they are placed in landfill. the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of ph level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to restore native life.
fluidized bed combustion also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production.
vehicle emissions control reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.
international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the 1985 helsinki protocol on the reduction of sulphur emissions under the convention on long-range transboundary air pollution. canada and the us signed the air quality agreement in 1991. most european countries and canada have signed the treaties.
in this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. the intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.
the first emissions trading market was established in the united states by enactment of the clean air act amendments of 1990. the overall goal of the acid rain program established by the act is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (so) and nitrogen oxides (no), the primary causes of acid rain. to achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

in church history, the term (from ancient greek: ἀκέφαλοι "akephaloi", "headless", singular ἀκέφαλος "akephalos" from ἀ- "a-", "without", and κεφαλή "kephalé", "head") has been applied to several sects that supposedly had no leader. e. cobham brewer wrote, in "dictionary of phrase and fable", that acephalites, "properly means men without a head." jean cooper wrote, in "dictionary of christianity", that it characterizes "various schismatical christian bodies". among them were nestorians who rejected the council of ephesus condemnation of patriarch nestorius of constantinople, which deposed nestorius and declared him a heretic.
those who refused to acknowledge the authority of the council of chalcedon were originally called haesitantes; the "" developed from among them, and, according to blunt, the earlier name – haesitantes – seems to have been used for only a short time.
with the apparent purpose of bringing the orthodox and heretics into unity, patriarch peter iii of alexandria and patriarch acacius of constantinople had elaborated a new creed in which they expressly condemned both nestorius and eutyches, a presbyter and archimandrite, but at the same time rejected the decisions of the council of chalcedon. this ambiguous formula, though approved by byzantine emperor zeno and imposed in his "henoticon", could only satisfy the indifferent.
the term applied to a 5th-century faction among the eutychians, who seceded from peter, a monophysite or more accurately a miaphysite, in 482, after peter signed the "henoticon" and was recognised by zeno as the legitimate patriarch of alexandria by which they were "deprived of their head".
the condemnation of eutyches irritated the rigid monophysites; the equivocal attitude taken towards the council of chalcedon appeared to them insufficient, and many of them, especially the monks, deserted peter, preferring to be without a head, rather than remain in communion with him.
later, they joined the adherents of the non-chalcedonian patriarch severus of antioch.
they were, according to "oxford english dictionary online", a "group of extreme monophysites" and "were absorbed by the jacobites".
liberatus of carthage wrote, in ', that those at the council of ephesus who followed neither patriarch cyril i of alexandria nor patriarch john i of antioch were called '.
esaianites were one of the sects into which the alexandrian " separated at the end of the 5th century. they were the followers of esaias, a deacon of palestine, who claimed to have been consecrated to the episcopal office by the bishop eusebius. his opponents averred that after the bishop's death his hands had been laid upon the head of esaias by some of his friends.
' were a sect of ' who followed chalcedonian patriarch paul of alexandria, who was deposed by a synod at gaza, in 541, for his uncanonical consecration by the patriarch of constantinople, and who, after his deposition, sided with the miaphysites.
barsanians, later called semidalites, were a sect of " at the end of the 5th century. they had no succession of priests, and professed to keep up the celebration of a valid eucharist by placing a few crumbs of some of the bread which had been consecrated by dioscorus into a vessel of meal, and then using as fully consecrated the bread baked from it.
according to brewer, acephalites were also certain bishops exempt from the jurisdiction and discipline of their patriarch. cooper explains that they are "priests rejecting episcopal authority or bishops that of their metropolitans." blunt described "" as those clergy who were ordained with a sinecure benefice and who generally obtained their orders by paying for them, that is by simony. the council of pavia, in 853, legislated its canons 18 and 23 against them, from which it appears, according to blunt, that they were mostly chaplains to noblemen, that they produced much scandal in the church, and that they disseminated many errors.
according to brewer, acephalites were also a sect of levellers during the reign of henry i of england who acknowledged no leader. they were, according to "oxford english dictionary online", "a group of free socagers having no feudal superior except the king." this usage is now considered obsolete.
fabled human-like creatures in greek mythology, analogous to pliny the elder's ', without heads and with facial features on their torsos, were also called '.

anthony (27 december 1755 in dresden – 6 june 1836 in dresden), also known by his german name anton (full name: "anton clemens theodor maria joseph johann evangelista johann nepomuk franz xavier aloys januar"), was a king of saxony (1827–1836) from the house of wettin. he became known as "anton der gütige", (en: "anthony the kind").
he was the fifth but third surviving son of frederick christian, elector of saxony, and maria antonia of bavaria.
with few chances to take part in the politics of the electorate of saxony or receive any land from his older brother frederick augustus iii, anton lived under the shadows. no elector of saxony after johann georg i gave appanages to his younger sons.
during the first years of the reign of his older brother as elector, anton was the third in line, preceded only by his older brother karl. the death of karl (8 september 1781) make him the next in line to the electorate as crown prince (de: "kronprinz"); this was because all the pregnancies of the electress amalie, except for one daughter, ended in a stillbirth.
his aunt, the dauphine of france, had wanted to engage her daughter marie zéphyrine of france to anthony; marie zéphyrine died in 1755 abandoning plans. another french candidate was marie zéphyrine's sister marie clothilde (later queen of sardinia) but again nothing happened.
in turin on 29 september 1781 (by proxy) and again in dresden on 24 october 1781 (in person), anton married firstly with the princess caroline of savoy (maria carolina antonietta adelaida), daughter of the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia and maria antonietta of spain. caroline died after only one year of marriage, on 28 december 1782 having succumbed to smallpox. they had no children.
in florence on 8 september 1787 (by proxy) and again in dresden on 18 october 1787 (in person), anton married a second time with the archduchess maria theresia of austria (maria theresia josephe charlotte johanna), daughter of the grand duke leopold i of tuscany, later emperor leopold ii. mozart's opera "don giovanni" was originally intended to be performed in honor of anton and his wife for a visit to prague on 14 october 1787, as they traveled between dresden and vienna, and librettos were printed with dedication to them. the premiere could not be arranged in time, however, so the opera "the marriage of figaro" was substituted on the express orders of the bride's uncle, holy roman emperor joseph ii. the choice of "the marriage of figaro" was considered improper for a new bride by many observers, and the couple left the opera theater early without seeing the entire work performed. mozart complained bitterly of the intrigues surrounding this incident in a letter to his friend gottfried von jacquin that was written in stages between 15 october and 25 october 1787. anthony was also present in prague in september 1791 for the first performance of mozart's opera "la clemenza di tito", which was written as part of the coronation ceremonies of his father-in-law, holy roman emperor leopold ii, as king of bohemia.
the couple had four children, but none survived to the age of two:
the electress gave birth for last time in 1799 to another stillborn child. after this anton became, officially, the heir to the electorate and, from 1806, the kingdom of saxony.
anton succeeded his brother frederick august i as king of saxony when he died, on 5 may 1827. the 71-year-old new king was completely inexperienced in government, thus he had no intention of initiating profound changes in foreign or domestic policy.
prussian diplomats discussed granting the prussian rhineland (predominantly catholic) to anton (a catholic) in exchange for lutheran saxony in 1827, but nothing came of these talks.
after the july revolution of 1830 in france, disturbances in saxony began in autumn. these were directed primarily against the old constitution. therefore, on 13 september the cabinet dismissed count detlev von einsiedel, followed by bernhard von lindenau. because the people wished a younger regent, anton agreed to appoint his nephew frederick augustus prince co-regent (de: "prinz-mitregenten"). as another consequence of the disturbances, a new constitution was accepted in 1831 which came into effect on 4 september of that year. with it saxony became a constitutional monarchy and obtained a bi-cameral legislature and a responsible ministry, which replaced the old feudal estates. the constitution was more conservative than other constitutions existing at this time in the german union. still the constitution served saxony until 1918. the king kept his exclusive sovereignty but was bound by the government business to cooperate with the ministers and the decisions of both chambers of the states (de: "kammern der ständeversammlung") meeting. the entry of saxony into the "zollverein" in 1833 let trade, industry and traffic blossom farther.
without surviving male issue, anton was succeeded as king by his nephew, frederick augustus ii.

albert iii () (27 january 144312 september 1500) was a duke of saxony. he was nicknamed albert the bold or albert the courageous and founded the "albertine line" of the house of wettin.
albert was born in grimma as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of frederick ii the gentle, elector of saxony, and margarete of austria, sister of frederick iii, holy roman emperor. later, he was a member of the order of the golden fleece.
after escaping from the hands of kunz von kaufungen, who had abducted him together with his brother ernest, he spent some time at the court of the emperor frederick iii in vienna.
in eger (cheb) on 11 november 1464 albert married zdenka (sidonie), daughter of george of podebrady, king of bohemia; but failed to obtain the bohemian crown on the death of george in 1471. after the death of his father in 1464, albert and ernest ruled their lands together, but in 1485 a division was made by the treaty of leipzig, and albert received the meissen, together with some adjoining districts, and founded the albertine branch of the house of wettin.
regarded as a capable soldier by the emperor, albert (in 1475) took a prominent part in the campaign against charles the bold, duke of burgundy, and in 1487 led an expedition against matthias corvinus, king of hungary, which failed owing to lack of support on the part of the emperor.
in 1488 he was appointed governor of the netherlands (until 1493) and marched with the imperial forces to free the roman king maximilian from his imprisonment at bruges, and when, in 1489, the king returned to germany, albert was left as his representative to prosecute the war against the rebels. he was successful in restoring the authority of maximilian in holland, flanders, and brabant, but failed to obtain any repayment of the large sums of money which he had spent in these campaigns.
his services were rewarded in 1498 when maximilian bestowed upon him the title of hereditary governor ("potestat") of friesland, but he had to make good his claim by force of arms. he had to a great extent succeeded, and was paying a visit to saxony, when he was recalled by news of a fresh rising. the duke recaptured groningen, but soon afterwards he died at emden. he was buried at meissen.
albert, who was a man of great strength and considerable skill in feats of arms, delighted in tournaments and knightly exercises. his loyalty to the emperor frederick, and the expenses incurred in this connection, aroused some irritation among his subjects, but his rule was a period of prosperity in saxony.
with his wife sidonie, albrecht had nine children:

arlo davy guthrie (born july 10, 1947) is an american folk singer-songwriter. like his father, woody guthrie, he is known for singing songs of protest against social injustice, and storytelling while performing songs. guthrie's best-known work is his debut piece, "alice's restaurant massacree", a satirical talking blues song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a thanksgiving anthem. his only top-40 hit was a cover of steve goodman's "city of new orleans". his song "massachusetts" was named the official folk song of the state in which he has lived most of his adult life. guthrie has also made several acting appearances. he is the father of four children, who have also had careers as musicians.
guthrie was born in brooklyn, new york, the son of the folk singer and composer woody guthrie and marjorie mazia guthrie. his sister is the record producer nora guthrie. his mother was a one-time professional dancer with the martha graham company and founder of the committee to combat huntington's disease (later huntington's disease society of america), the illness from which woody guthrie died in 1967. arlo's father was from a protestant family and his mother was jewish. his maternal grandmother was the renowned yiddish poet aliza greenblatt.
guthrie received religious training for his bar mitzvah from rabbi meir kahane, who would go on to form the jewish defense league. "rabbi kahane was a really nice, patient teacher," guthrie later recalled, "but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire. maybe i was responsible." guthrie converted to catholicism in 1977, before embracing interfaith beliefs later in his life.
guthrie attended woodward school in clinton hill, brooklyn, from first through eighth grades and later graduated from the stockbridge school, in stockbridge, massachusetts, in 1965. he spent the summer of 1965 in london, eventually meeting karl dallas, who connected guthrie with london's folk rock scene and became a lifelong friend of his. he briefly attended rocky mountain college, in billings, montana. he received an honorary doctorate from siena college in 1981 and from westfield state college in 2008.
as a singer, songwriter and lifelong political activist, guthrie carries on the legacy of his father. he was awarded the peace abbey courage of conscience award on september 26, 1992.
on thanksgiving day 1965, while in stockbridge, massachusetts, during a break from his brief stint in college, 18-year-old arlo guthrie was arrested for illegally dumping on private property what he described as "a half-ton of garbage" from the home of his friends, teachers ray and alice brock, after he discovered the local landfill was closed for the holiday. guthrie and his friend, richard robbins, appeared in court, pled guilty to the charges, were levied a nominal fine and picked up the garbage that weekend.
this littering charge would soon serve as the basis for guthrie's most famous work, "alice's restaurant massacree", a talking blues song that lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds in its original recorded version. guthrie has pointed out that this was also the exact length of one of the infamous gaps in richard nixon's watergate tapes, and that nixon owned a copy of the record. the alice in the song is alice brock, who had been a librarian at arlo's boarding school in the town before opening her restaurant. she later opened an art studio in provincetown, massachusetts.
the song lampoons the vietnam war draft. however, guthrie has stated in multiple interviews that the song is more an "anti-stupidity" song than an anti-war song, adding that it is based on a true incident. in the song, guthrie is called up for a draft examination and rejected as unfit for military service as a result of a criminal record consisting solely of one conviction for the aforementioned littering. alice and her restaurant are the subjects of the refrain, but are generally mentioned only incidentally in the story (early drafts of the song explained that the restaurant was a place to hide from the police). though her presence is implied at certain points in the story, alice herself is described explicitly in the tale only briefly when she bails guthrie and a friend out of jail. on the dvd commentary for the 1969 movie, guthrie stated that the events presented in the song all actually happened (others, such as the arresting officer, william obanhein, disputed some of the song's details, but generally verified the truth of the overall story).
"alice's restaurant" was the song that earned guthrie his first recording contract, after counterculture radio host bob fass began playing a tape recording of one of guthrie's live performances of the song repeatedly one night in 1967. a performance at the newport folk festival on july 17, 1967, was also very well received. soon afterward, guthrie recorded the song in front of a studio audience in new york city and released it as side one of the album, "alice's restaurant". by the end of the decade, guthrie had gone from playing coffee houses and small venues to playing massive and prestigious venues such as carnegie hall and the woodstock festival.
for a short period after its release in october 1967, "alice's restaurant" was heavily played on u.s. college and counterculture radio stations. it became a symbol of the late 1960s, and for many it defined an attitude and lifestyle that were lived out across the country in the ensuing years. its leisurely, sassy finger-picking acoustic guitar and rambling lyrics were widely memorized and played by irreverent youth. many stations in the united states have a thanksgiving day tradition of playing "alice's restaurant".
a 1969 film, directed and co-written by arthur penn, was based on the true story told in the song, but with the addition of a large number of fictional scenes. this film, also called "alice's restaurant", featured arlo and several other figures in the song portraying themselves. the part of his father woody guthrie, who had died in 1967, was played by an actor, joseph boley; alice, who made a cameo appearance as an extra, was also recast, with actress pat quinn in the title role (alice brock later disowned the film's portrayal of her).
despite its popularity, the song "alice's restaurant massacree" is not always featured on the set list of any given guthrie performance. since putting it back into his setlist in 1984, he has performed the song every ten years, stating in a 2014 interview that the vietnam war had ended by the 1970s and that everyone who was attending his concerts had likely already heard the song anyway. so, after a brief period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he replaced the monologue with a fictional one involving "multicolored rainbow roaches", he decided to do it only on special occasions from that point forward.
the "alice's restaurant" song was one of a few very long songs to become popular just when albums began replacing hit singles as young people's main music listening. but in 1972 guthrie had a highly successful single too, steve goodman's song "city of new orleans", a wistful paean to long-distance passenger rail travel. guthrie's first trip on that train was in december 2005 (when his family joined other musicians on a train trip across the country to raise money for musicians financially devastated by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita, in the south of the united states). he also had a minor hit with his song "coming into los angeles", which was played at the 1969 woodstock festival, but did not get much radio airplay because of its plot (involving the smuggling of drugs from london by airplane), and success with a live version of "the motorcycle song" (one of the songs on the b-side of the "alice's restaurant" album). a cover of the folk song "gypsy davy" was a hit on the easy listening charts.
in the fall of 1975 during a benefit concert in massachusetts, arlo guthrie performed with his band, shenandoah, in public for the first time. they continued to tour and record throughout the 1970s until the early 1990s. although the band received good reviews, it never gained the popularity that guthrie did while playing solo. this band is not to be confused with the popular country music group shenandoah, an entirely different group that had musical hits from 1986 to 2006. arlo guthrie's band shenandoah consisted (after 1976) of david grover, steve ide, carol ide, terry a la berry and dan velika. the ides, along with terry a la berry, reunited with guthrie for a 2018 tour.
guthrie's 1976 album "amigo" received a five-star (highest rating) from "rolling stone", and may be his best-received work. however, that album, like guthrie's earlier warner bros. records albums, is rarely heard today, even though each contains strong folk and folk rock music accompanied by widely regarded musicians such as ry cooder.
a number of musicians from a variety of genres have joined guthrie onstage, including pete seeger, david bromberg, cyril neville, emmylou harris, willie nelson, judy collins, john prine, wesley gray, josh ritter, and others.
though guthrie is best known for being a musician, singer, and composer, throughout the years he has also appeared as an actor in films and on television. the film "alice's restaurant" (1969) is his best known role, but he has had small parts in several films and even co-starred in a television drama, "byrds of paradise".
guthrie has had minor roles in several movies and television series. usually, he has appeared as himself, often performing music and/or being interviewed about the 1960s, folk music and various social causes. his television appearances have included a broad range of programs from "the muppet show" (1979) to "politically incorrect" (1998). a rare dramatic film part was in the 1992 movie "roadside prophets". guthrie's memorable appearance at the 1969 woodstock festival was documented in the michael wadleigh film "woodstock".
guthrie also made a pilot for a tv variety show called "the arlo guthrie show" in february 1987. the hour-long program included story telling and musical performances and was filmed in austin, texas. it was broadcast nationally on pbs. special guests were pete seeger, bonnie raitt, david bromberg and jerry jeff walker.
in his earlier years, at least from the 1960s to the 1980s, guthrie had taken a decidedly leftist approach to american politics. in his often lengthy comments during concerts his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-nixon, pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal. however, he apparently regarded himself as more an individualist than the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song "prologue": "i can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations, ... and together we sang our victory songs though we were worlds apart." a 1969 rewrite of "alice's restaurant" pokes fun at then-former president lyndon johnson and his staff.
in 1984, he was the featured celebrity in george mcgovern's campaign for the democratic presidential nomination in guthrie's home state of massachusetts, performing at rallies and receptions.
guthrie identified as a registered republican in 2008. he endorsed texas congressman ron paul for the 2008 republican party nomination, and said, "i love this guy. dr. paul is the only candidate i know of who would have signed the constitution of the united states had he been there. i'm with him, because he seems to be the only candidate who actually believes it has as much relevance today as it did a couple of hundred years ago. i look forward to the day when we can work out the differences we have with the same revolutionary vision and enthusiasm that is our american legacy." he told "the new york times magazine" that he is a republican because, "we had enough good democrats. we needed a few more good republicans. we needed a loyal opposition."
commenting on the upcoming 2016 election, guthrie identified himself as an independent, and said he was "equally suspicious of democrats as i am of republicans." he declined to endorse a candidate, noting that he personally liked bernie sanders despite disagreeing with sanders' platform, and he praised donald trump for not relying on campaign donations, stating that he thought it "wonderful" that "he's [trump] not in anyone's pocket," but did not believe that this necessarily means that trump has the best interests of the country in mind.
in 2018, guthrie contacted publication urban milwaukee to clarify his political stance. he stated "i am not a republican," and expressed deep disagreement with the trump administration's views and policies on immigration. guthrie further clarified, "i left the party years ago and do not identify myself with either party these days. i strongly urge my fellow americans to stop the current trend of guilt by association, and look beyond the party names and affiliations, and work for candidates whose policies are more closely aligned with their own, whatever they may be ... i don't pretend to be right all the time, and sometimes i've gone so far as to change my mind from time to time."
like his father, woody guthrie, guthrie often sings songs of protest against social injustice. he collaborated with poet adrian mitchell to tell the story of chilean folk singer and activist víctor jara in song. he regularly performed with folk musician pete seeger, one of his father's longtime partners. ramblin' jack elliott, who had lived for two years in the guthries' home before arlo left for boarding school, had absorbed woody's style perhaps better than anyone; arlo has been said to have credited elliott for passing it along to him.
in 1991, guthrie bought the church that had served as alice and ray brock's former home in great barrington, massachusetts, and converted it to the guthrie center, an interfaith meeting place that serves people of all religions. the center provides weekly free lunches in the community and support for families living with hiv/aids, as well as other life-threatening illnesses. it also hosts a summertime concert series and guthrie does six or seven fund raising shows there every year. there are several annual events such as the walk-a-thon to cure huntington's disease and a "thanksgiving dinner that can't be beat" for families, friends, doctors and scientists who live and work with huntington's disease.
one of the title characters in the comic strip "arlo and janis" is named after guthrie. cartoonist jimmy johnson noted he was inspired by a friend who resembled guthrie to name one of his characters arlo.
guthrie resides in the town of washington, massachusetts, where he and jackie hyde, his wife of 43 years, were long time residents. jackie died on october 14, 2012, shortly after being diagnosed with liver cancer. he also has a home in sebastian, florida.
guthrie's son abe guthrie and his daughters annie, sarah lee guthrie, and cathy guthrie are also musicians. annie guthrie writes songs and performs, and also takes care of family touring details. sarah lee performs and records with her husband johnny irion. cathy plays ukulele in folk uke, a group she formed with amy nelson, the daughter of willie nelson. abe guthrie was formerly in the folk-rock band, xavier, and has also toured with his father. abe guthrie's son, krishna, is a drummer and toured with arlo guthrie on his european tour in 2006 and played guitar for the 2009–2010 tour. krishna plays drums in modest me. arlo guthrie is a grandfather of abe's son krishna and daughter serena, annie's son shiva das (mo) and daughter jacklyn, sarah lee's daughters olivia nora and sophia irion and cathy's daughter marjorie maybelle midwood.

the book of alma: the son of alma (), usually referred to as the book of alma, is one of the books that make up the book of mormon. the title refers to alma the younger, a prophet and "chief judge" of the nephites.
the book of alma is the longest of all the books of the book of mormon, consisting of 63 chapters. the book records the first 39 years of what the nephites termed "the reign of the judges", a period in which the nephite nation adopted a constitutional theocratic government in which the judicial and executive branches of the government were combined.
the history of the book is outlined as follows:
the first four chapters, describe the rebellions of followers of nehor and amlici. contrary to the dominant lay ministry that existed in the nephite culture, nehor established a church in which priests were given a separate social status and were paid for their ministry. after killing a religious leader during a theological argument, nehor was tried and executed for his crimes. the followers of amlici resented the dominant political and religious parties and sought to reestablish the monarchy that the reign of the judges had replaced. alma, who was chief judge, governor, and high priest over the people of nephi, led an army against amlici and his followers and drove the rebellion out of the land.
towards the end of chapter four, alma realizes that the affairs of the church require his entire concentration. he resigns from his political office and appoints nephihah as chief judge and governor of the land. chapters 5-16 record sermons and missionary travels of alma between 83 and 78 bc. alma and one of his converted followers, amulek, provide important teachings about the atonement of christ, overcoming pride and the natural man, retaining conversion, the resurrection of all men, and judgment day. later, their teachings about faith and worship in alma 32-34 are important sources of instruction and insight.
chapters 17 to 27 describe the missionary labors of the sons of king mosiah ii who was the last king over the people of nephi prior to the peaceful transition of the nation from a monarchy to a republican form of government. the sons of mosiah, named ammon, aaron, omner and himni, chose to devote themselves to missionary labors preaching to the people of the lamanite nation, which periodically went to war against the nephite nation. they lived and taught among the lamanites between the years 91 and 77 bc.
chapters 28 to 35 relate the account of a rebellion of a subgroup of the nephite nation who called themselves zoramites. the zoramites believed in a form of predestination and taught that all others except their people would be damned. their apostasy from the church was conjoined with plans to rebel against the nephite government. alma took two of his sons, the sons of mosiah, amulek, and zeezrom on a mission among the zoramites in an attempt to restore their loyalty to both the church and the state. alma and his companions had some success among the poor class of zoramites who were then exiled from the zoramite community by the governing rich class of zoramites. the wealthier zoramites eventually defected and united with the lamanites.
chapters 36 to 42 record the teachings of alma to his sons, helaman, shiblon, and corianton. these teachings discuss the ministry and atonement of jesus, the laws of justice and mercy, the need for repentance, and the resurrection and judgment of all people.
chapters 43 to 62 record the struggles of the nephite people during a war against the attacking lamanite nation between the years of 74 and 57 bc. the chief captain (senior military commander) of the nephites during this time was captain moroni. the nephites were ultimately successful in their defense against the lamanites.
chapter 63 includes concluding historical notes covering the years 56 to 53 bc. this is largely a period of post-war reconstruction and exploration in the nephite nation.
this outline is based on "main sections" and "antagonist characters" in the book of alma. there are two main features in this history, chapters 1 - 42 deal with missionary work, and chapters 43 - 63 contain the wars. the history of the zoramites provides a transition from missionary work to the war chapters of the book of alma. the two main sections also mirror the first two antagonist characters, nehor ("religious agenda") and amlici ("political agenda").
in , alma the younger speaks to the people of zarahemla in which he asks 50 rhetorical questions, which are widely cited in the lds church.
alma's sermon on faith to the zoramites in is widely used to explain the process of developing faith. investigators are invited to try a similar experiment of faith in order to come to develop a testimony. it is worth noting that alma doesn't actually compare faith to a seed, he compares the word to a seed (), although this is a common misconception.
according to john w. welch, based on the appearance of the following elements in alma 12-13, the nephite temple ceremony utilized familiar temple motifs, including:

antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation. oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, thereby leading to chain reactions that may damage the cells of organisms. antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin c) terminate these chain reactions. to balance the oxidative stress, plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., catalase and superoxide dismutase), produced internally, or the dietary antioxidants vitamin c, and vitamin e.
the term "antioxidant" is mostly used for two entirely different groups of substances: industrial chemicals that are added to products to prevent oxidation, and naturally occurring compounds that are present in foods and tissue. the former, industrial antioxidants, have diverse uses: acting as preservatives in food and cosmetics, and being oxidation-inhibitors in fuels.
antioxidant dietary supplements have not been shown to improve health in humans, or to be effective at preventing disease. supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin a, and vitamin e have no positive effect on mortality rate or cancer risk. additionally, supplementation with selenium or vitamin e do not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
although certain levels of antioxidant vitamins in the diet are required for good health, there is still considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidants are health-promoting in the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, and others declare that the hypothesis is unproven and misguided. polyphenols, which have antioxidant properties in vitro, have unknown antioxidant activity in vivo due to extensive metabolism following digestion and little clinical evidence of efficacy.
although dietary antioxidants have been investigated for potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease, the studies had poor design and there was no evidence of effect, except for maintaining normal levels of vitamin c to lower the risk of cognitive deficits during aging.
common pharmaceuticals (and supplements) with antioxidant properties may interfere with the efficacy of certain anticancer medication and radiation. a 2016 systematic review examined allopurinol and acetylcysteine as possible add-on treatments for schizophrenia. tirilazad, a steroid derivative that inhibits lipid peroxidation, was shown in human trials to have no effect on mortality or other outcomes in subarachnoid haemorrhage and worsened results in ischemic stroke.
relatively strong reducing acids can have antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing them from being absorbed. examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.
high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. the beta-carotene and retinol efficacy trial (caret) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin a had increased rates of lung cancer. subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects. these harmful effects may also be seen in non-smokers, as one meta-analysis including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin a or vitamin e supplementation is associated with increased mortality, but saw no significant effect from vitamin c. no health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. as the majority of these low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. this meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the cochrane collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. these two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that vitamin e supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.
a paradox in metabolism is that, while the vast majority of complex life on earth requires oxygen for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species. consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as dna, proteins and lipids. in general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. however, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as redox signaling. thus, the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level.
the reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (ho), hypochlorous acid (hclo), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·oh) and the superoxide anion (o). the hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. this species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the fenton reaction. these oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing dna or proteins. damage to dna can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by dna repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.
the use of oxygen as part of the process for generating metabolic energy produces reactive oxygen species. in this process, the superoxide anion is produced as a by-product of several steps in the electron transport chain. particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme q in complex iii, since a highly reactive free radical is formed as an intermediate (q·). this unstable intermediate can lead to electron "leakage", when electrons jump directly to oxygen and form the superoxide anion, instead of moving through the normal series of well-controlled reactions of the electron transport chain. peroxide is also produced from the oxidation of reduced flavoproteins, such as complex i. however, although these enzymes can produce oxidants, the relative importance of the electron transfer chain to other processes that generate peroxide is unclear. in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, reactive oxygen species are also produced during photosynthesis, particularly under conditions of high light intensity. this effect is partly offset by the involvement of carotenoids in photoinhibition, and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of iodide and selenium, which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the photosynthetic reaction centres to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species.
antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). in general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. these compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. the different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.
the relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. the action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. the amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.
some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as "antioxidant nutrients", but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.
uric acid is by far the highest concentration antioxidant in human blood. uric acid (ua) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism. in almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that ua is not further broken down. the evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. the antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.
uric acid has the highest concentration of any blood antioxidant and provides over half of the total antioxidant capacity of human serum. uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide, but does act against peroxynitrite, peroxides, and hypochlorous acid. concerns over elevated ua's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. by itself, ua-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/l) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at ua supersaturation levels (535+ μmol/l). many of these aforementioned studies determined ua's antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels, and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/l.
ascorbic acid or vitamin c is a monosaccharide oxidation-reduction (redox) catalyst found in both animals and plants. as one of the enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution, humans must obtain it from their diet; it is therefore a dietary vitamin. most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. ascorbic acid is required for the conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to hydroxyproline. in other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins. ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. in addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, a function that is used in stress resistance in plants. ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20 millimolar in chloroplasts.
glutathione is a cysteine-containing peptide found in most forms of aerobic life. it is not required in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent amino acids. glutathione has antioxidant properties since the thiol group in its cysteine moiety is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. in cells, glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme glutathione reductase and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as ascorbate in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins, as well as reacting directly with oxidants. due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, glutathione is one of the most important cellular antioxidants. in some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols, such as by mycothiol in the actinomycetes, bacillithiol in some gram-positive bacteria, or by trypanothione in the kinetoplastids.
vitamin e is the collective name for a set of eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties. of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest bioavailability, with the body preferentially absorbing and metabolising this form.
it has been claimed that the α-tocopherol form is the most important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. this removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. this reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. this is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (gpx4)-deficient cells from cell death. gpx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.
however, the roles and importance of the various forms of vitamin e are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. the functions of the other forms of vitamin e are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.
antioxidants that are reducing agents can also act as pro-oxidants. for example, vitamin c has antioxidant activity when it reduces oxidizing substances such as hydrogen peroxide; however, it will also reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the fenton reaction.
the relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants is an area of current research, but vitamin c, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body. however, less data is available for other dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin e, or the polyphenols. likewise, the pathogenesis of diseases involving hyperuricemia likely involve uric acid's direct and indirect pro-oxidant properties.
that is, paradoxically, agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional pro-oxidants and actually increase oxidative stress. besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as homocysteine. typically, this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. the potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. another example is the postulated role of homocysteine in atherosclerosis.
as with the chemical antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. here, the superoxide released by processes such as oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. this detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. as with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.
superoxide dismutases (sods) are a class of closely related enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of the superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. sod enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. in humans, the copper/zinc sod is present in the cytosol, while manganese sod is present in the mitochondrion. there also exists a third form of sod in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. the mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. in contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc sod (sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular sod have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). in plants, sod isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron sod found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.
catalases are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, using either an iron or manganese cofactor. this protein is localized to peroxisomes in most eukaryotic cells. catalase is an unusual enzyme since, although hydrogen peroxide is its only substrate, it follows a ping-pong mechanism. here, its cofactor is oxidised by one molecule of hydrogen peroxide and then regenerated by transferring the bound oxygen to a second molecule of substrate. despite its apparent importance in hydrogen peroxide removal, humans with genetic deficiency of catalase — "acatalasemia" — or mice genetically engineered to lack catalase completely, suffer few ill effects.
peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. they are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. these enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed by the action of sulfiredoxin. peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from hemolytic anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.
the thioredoxin system contains the 12-kda protein thioredoxin and its companion thioredoxin reductase. proteins related to thioredoxin are present in all sequenced organisms. plants, such as "arabidopsis thaliana," have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. the active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, as part of a highly conserved cxxc motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. in its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. after being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using nadph as an electron donor.
the glutathione system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione "s"-transferases. this system is found in animals, plants and microorganisms. glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. there are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. in addition, the glutathione "s"-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. these enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.
oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the development of a wide range of diseases including alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. in many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; one case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. here, low density lipoprotein (ldl) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.
oxidative damage in dna can cause cancer. several antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione s-transferase etc. protect dna from oxidative stress. it has been proposed that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with dna damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.
a low calorie diet extends median and maximum lifespan in many animals. this effect may involve a reduction in oxidative stress. while there is some evidence to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as "drosophila melanogaster" and "caenorhabditis elegans", the evidence in mammals is less clear. indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.
antioxidants are used as food additives to help guard against food deterioration. exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. however, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. these preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (aa, e300) and tocopherols (e306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (pg, e310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (tbhq), butylated hydroxyanisole (bha, e320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (bht, e321).
the most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn rancid. since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.
antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. a common use is as stabilizers in fuels and lubricants to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues. in 2014, the worldwide market for natural and synthetic antioxidants was us$2.25 billion with a forecast of growth to $3.25 billion by 2020.
antioxidant polymer stabilizers are widely used to prevent the degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. they can be protected by antiozonants. solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. the mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a "crazy paving" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product. oxidation and uv degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because uv radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. the free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. the former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.
antioxidant vitamins are found in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. vitamins a, c, and e can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. the effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.
other antioxidants are not obtained from the diet, but instead are made in the body. for example, ubiquinol (coenzyme q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. as any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.
measurement of antioxidant content in food is not a straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. in food science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac) was once an industry standard for estimating antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives, mainly from the presence of polyphenols. earlier measurements and ratings by the united states department of agriculture were withdrawn in 2012 as biologically irrelevant to human health, referring to an absence of physiological evidence for polyphenols having antioxidant properties "in vivo". consequently, the orac method, derived only from "in vitro" experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.
alternative "in vitro" measurements of antioxidant content in foods – also based on the presence of polyphenols – include the folin-ciocalteu reagent, and the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay.
as part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin c), polyphenols and tocopherols. the evolution of angiosperm plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments – particularly during the jurassic period – as chemical defences against reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of photosynthesis. originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal corrosion, the vulcanization of rubber, and the polymerization of fuels in the fouling of internal combustion engines.
early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. however, it was the identification of vitamins c and e as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. the possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. research into how vitamin e prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.

brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, in proportions which can be varied to achieve varying mechanical and electrical properties. it is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. bronze is an alloy also containing copper, but instead of zinc it has tin.
both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic, lead, phosphorus, aluminum, manganese, and silicon. the distinction is largely historical. modern practice in museums and archaeology increasingly avoids both terms for historical objects in favour of the all-embracing "copper alloy".
brass is used for decoration for its bright gold-like appearance; for applications where low friction is required such as locks, gears, bearings, doorknobs, ammunition casings and valves; for plumbing and electrical applications; and extensively in brass musical instruments such as horns and bells where a combination of high workability (historically with hand tools) and durability is desired. it is also used in zippers. brass is often used in situations in which it is important that sparks not be struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.
brass has higher malleability than bronze or zinc. the relatively low melting point of brass (, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast. by varying the proportions of copper and zinc, the properties of the brass can be changed, allowing hard and soft brasses. the density of brass is .
today, almost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled. because brass is not ferromagnetic, it can be separated from ferrous scrap by passing the scrap near a powerful magnet. brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry where it is melted and recast into billets. billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size. the general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of cutting fluid, though there are exceptions to this.
aluminum makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. aluminum also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of aluminum oxide (alo) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in seawater applications (naval brasses). combinations of iron, aluminum, silicon and manganese make brass wear and tear resistant.
to enhance the machinability of brass, lead is often added in concentrations of around 2%. since lead has a lower melting point than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting. the pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. in addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. these effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.
in october 1999 the california state attorney general sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content. in laboratory tests, state researchers found the average brass key, new or old, exceeded the california proposition 65 limits by an average factor of 19, assuming handling twice a day. in april 2001 manufacturers agreed to reduce lead content to 1.5%, or face a requirement to warn consumers about lead content. keys plated with other metals are not affected by the settlement, and may continue to use brass alloys with higher percentage of lead content.
also in california, lead-free materials must be used for "each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes and pipe fittings, plumbing fittings and fixtures." on january 1, 2010, the maximum amount of lead in "lead-free brass" in california was reduced from 4% to 0.25% lead.
<nowiki> </nowiki>the so-called dezincification resistant (dzr or dr) brasses, sometimes referred to as cr (corrosion resistant) brasses, are used where there is a large corrosion risk and where normal brasses do not meet the standards. applications with high water temperatures, chlorides present, or deviating water qualities (soft water) play a role. dzr-brass is excellent in water boiler systems. this brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.
the high malleability and workability, relatively good resistance to corrosion, and traditionally attributed acoustic properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of musical instruments whose acoustic resonators consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; silver and its alloys, and even gold, have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. collectively known as brass instruments, these include the trombone, tuba, trumpet, cornet, baritone horn, euphonium, tenor horn, and french horn, and many other "horns", many in variously-sized families, such as the saxhorns. other wind instruments may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model flutes and piccolos are made of some variety of brass, usually a cupronickel alloy similar to nickel silver/german silver. clarinets, especially low clarinets such as the contrabass and subcontrabass, are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller woodwinds. for the same reason, some low clarinets, bassoons and contrabassoons feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. the use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. even though the saxophones and sarrusaphones are classified as woodwind instruments, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.
the keywork of most modern woodwinds, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as nickel silver/german silver. such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools -- a boon to quick repairs. the mouthpieces of both brass instruments and, less commonly, woodwind instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.
next to the brass instruments, the most notable use of brass in music is in various percussion instruments, most notably cymbals, gongs, and orchestral (tubular) bells (large "church" bells are normally made of bronze). small handbells and "jingle bell" are also commonly made of brass.
the harmonica is a free reed aerophone, also often made from brass. in organ pipes of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the shallot (or beat "through" the shallot in the case of a "free" reed). although not part of the brass section, snare drums are also sometimes made of brass. some parts on electric guitars are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.
the bactericidal properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents biofouling. depending upon the type and concentration of pathogens and the medium they are in, brass kills these microorganisms within a few minutes to hours of contact.
a large number of independent studies confirm this antimicrobial effect, even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as mrsa and vrsa. the mechanisms of antimicrobial action by copper and its alloys, including brass, are a subject of intense and ongoing investigation.
brass is susceptible to stress corrosion cracking, especially from ammonia or substances containing or releasing ammonia. the problem is sometimes known as season cracking after it was first discovered in brass cartridges used for rifle ammunition during the 1920s in the british indian army. the problem was caused by high residual stresses from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. the cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. the problem was resolved by annealing the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.
although forms of brass have been in use since prehistory, its true nature as a copper-zinc alloy was not understood until the post medieval period because the zinc vapor which reacted with copper to make brass was not recognised as a metal. the king james bible makes many references to "brass". the shakespearean english form of the word 'brass' can mean any bronze alloy, or copper, rather than the strict modern definition of brass. the earliest brasses may have been natural alloys made by smelting zinc-rich copper ores. by the roman period brass was being deliberately produced from metallic copper and zinc minerals using the cementation process, and variations on this method continued until the mid-19th century. it was eventually replaced by speltering, the direct alloying of copper and zinc metal which was introduced to europe in the 16th century.
in west asia and the eastern mediterranean early copper-zinc alloys are now known in small numbers from a number of 3rd millennium bc sites in the aegean, iraq, the united arab emirates, kalmykia, turkmenistan and georgia and from 2nd millennium bc sites in west india, uzbekistan, iran, syria, iraq and canaan. however, isolated examples of copper-zinc alloys are known in china from as early as the 5th millennium bc.
the compositions of these early "brass" objects are highly variable and most have zinc contents of between 5% and 15% wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation. these may be "natural alloys" manufactured by smelting zinc rich copper ores in redox conditions. many have similar tin contents to contemporary bronze artefacts and it is possible that some copper-zinc alloys were accidental and perhaps not even distinguished from copper. however the large number of copper-zinc alloys now known suggests that at least some were deliberately manufactured and many have zinc contents of more than 12% wt which would have resulted in a distinctive golden color.
by the 8th–7th century bc assyrian cuneiform tablets mention the exploitation of the "copper of the mountains" and this may refer to "natural" brass. "oreikhalkon" (mountain copper), the ancient greek translation of this term, was later adapted to the latin "aurichalcum" meaning "golden copper" which became the standard term for brass. in the 4th century bc plato knew "orichalkos" as rare and nearly as valuable as gold and pliny describes how "aurichalcum" had come from cypriot ore deposits which had been exhausted by the 1st century ad. x-ray fluorescence analysis of 39 orichalcum ingots recovered from a 2,600-year-old shipwreck off sicily found them to be an alloy made with 75–80 percent copper, 15–20 percent zinc and small percentages of nickel, lead and iron.
during the later part of first millennium bc the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from britain and spain in the west to iran, and india in the east. this seems to have been encouraged by exports and influence from the middle east and eastern mediterranean where deliberate production of brass from metallic copper and zinc ores had been introduced. the 4th century bc writer theopompus, quoted by strabo, describes how heating earth from andeira in turkey produced "droplets of false silver", probably metallic zinc, which could be used to turn copper into oreichalkos. in the 1st century bc the greek dioscorides seems to have recognised a link between zinc minerals and brass describing how cadmia (zinc oxide) was found on the walls of furnaces used to heat either zinc ore or copper and explaining that it can then be used to make brass.
by the first century bc brass was available in sufficient supply to use as coinage in phrygia and bithynia, and after the augustan currency reform of 23 bc it was also used to make roman "dupondii" and "sestertii". the uniform use of brass for coinage and military equipment across the roman world may indicate a degree of state involvement in the industry, and brass even seems to have been deliberately boycotted by jewish communities in palestine because of its association with roman authority.
brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper. there is good archaeological evidence for this process and crucibles used to produce brass by cementation have been found on roman period sites including xanten and nidda in germany, lyon in france and at a number of sites in britain. they vary in size from tiny acorn sized to large amphorae like vessels but all have elevated levels of zinc on the interior and are lidded. they show no signs of slag or metal prills suggesting that zinc minerals were heated to produce zinc vapor which reacted with metallic copper in a solid state reaction. the fabric of these crucibles is porous, probably designed to prevent a buildup of pressure, and many have small holes in the lids which may be designed to release pressure or to add additional zinc minerals near the end of the process. dioscorides mentioned that zinc minerals were used for both the working and finishing of brass, perhaps suggesting secondary additions.
brass made during the early roman period seems to have varied between 20% to 28% wt zinc. the high content of zinc in coinage and brass objects declined after the first century ad and it has been suggested that this reflects zinc loss during recycling and thus an interruption in the production of new brass. however it is now thought this was probably a deliberate change in composition and overall the use of brass increases over this period making up around 40% of all copper alloys used in the roman world by the 4th century ad.
little is known about the production of brass during the centuries immediately after the collapse of the roman empire. disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from western europe may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th–7th centuries ad over 90% of copper alloy artefacts from egypt were made of brass. however other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the islamic and byzantine world. conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in western europe during this period in favour of gunmetals and other mixed alloys but by about 1000 brass artefacts are found in scandinavian graves in scotland, brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in northumbria and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of calamine brass in germany and the low countries, areas rich in calamine ore.
these places would remain important centres of brass making throughout the medieval period, especially dinant. brass objects are still collectively known as "dinanterie" in french. the baptismal font at st bartholomew's church, liège in modern belgium (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of romanesque brass casting, though also often described as bronze. the metal of the early 12th-century gloucester candlestick is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony and arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver, ranging from 22.5% in the base to 5.76% in the pan below the candle. the proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins, probably late roman. latten is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal, whether of brass or bronze. aquamaniles were typically made in brass in both the european and islamic worlds.
the cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both europe and the islamic world seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles. islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as "tutiya" or tutty rather than zinc ores for brass-making, resulting in a metal with lower iron impurities. a number of islamic writers and the 13th century italian marco polo describe how this was obtained by sublimation from zinc ores and condensed onto clay or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at kush in iran. it could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. in 10th century yemen al-hamdani described how spreading al-iglimiya, probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal. the 13th century iranian writer al-kashani describes a more complex process whereby "tutiya" was mixed with raisins and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. a temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.
in europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the roman process and the use of the term tutty by albertus magnus in the 13th century suggests influence from islamic technology. the 12th century german monk theophilus described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and charcoal then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. the final product was cast, then again melted with calamine. it has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be absorbed. albertus magnus noted that the "power" of both calamine and tutty could evaporate and described how the addition of powdered glass could create a film to bind it to the metal.
german brass making crucibles are known from dortmund dating to the 10th century ad and from soest and schwerte in westphalia dating to around the 13th century confirm theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although ceramic discs from soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc evaporation, and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.
some of the most famous objects in african art are the lost wax castings of west africa, mostly from what is now nigeria, produced first by the kingdom of ife and then the benin empire. though normally described as "bronzes", the benin bronzes, now mostly in the british museum and other western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the bronze head from ife of "heavily leaded zinc-brass" and the bronze head of queen idia, both also british museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions. work in brass or bronze continued to be important in benin art and other west african traditions such as akan goldweights, where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in europe.
the renaissance saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in europe. by the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at zwickau in germany. these large crucibles were capable of producing c.20 kg of brass. there are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process. the crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc absorption in the final stages. triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for casting.
16th-century technical writers such as biringuccio, ercker and agricola described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added. zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. by 1513 metallic zinc ingots from india and china were arriving in london and pellets of zinc condensed in furnace flues at the rammelsberg in germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.
eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be alloyed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering, and by 1657 the german chemist johann glauber had recognised that calamine was "nothing else but unmeltable zinc" and that zinc was a "half ripe metal." however some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 wightman brass memorial plaque from england may have been made by alloying copper with "zinc" and include traces of cadmium similar to those found in some zinc ingots from china.
however, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of solid-state cementation in a domed furnace at around 900–950 °c and lasting up to 10 hours. the european brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of battery wares. by 1559 the germany city of aachen alone was capable of producing 300,000 cwt of brass per year. after several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in england taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper smelted in the new coal fired reverberatory furnace. in 1723 bristol brass maker nehemiah champion patented the use of granulated copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water. this increased the surface area of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.
in 1738 nehemiah's son william champion patented a technique for the first industrial scale distillation of metallic zinc known as "distillation per descencum" or "the english process". this local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as scientific instruments, clocks, brass buttons and costume jewellery. however champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at warmley. by the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as john-jaques dony's horizontal furnaces in belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc as well as demand for corrosion-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.

the federal city of bonn () is a city on the banks of the rhine in the german state of north rhine-westphalia, with a population of over 300,000. about south-southeast of cologne, bonn is in the southernmost part of the rhine-ruhr region, germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. it is famously known as the birthplace of ludwig van beethoven in 1770. beethoven spent his childhood and teenage years in bonn.
because of a political compromise following german reunification, the german federal government maintains a substantial presence in bonn. roughly a third of all ministerial jobs are located in bonn , and the city is considered a second, unofficial, capital of the country. bonn is the secondary seat of the president, the chancellor, the bundesrat and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. the title of federal city () reflects its important political status within germany.
founded in the 1st century bc as a roman settlement, bonn is one of germany's oldest cities. from 1597 to 1794, bonn was the capital of the electorate of cologne, and residence of the archbishops and prince-electors of cologne. from 1949 to 1990, bonn was the capital of west germany, and germany's present constitution, the basic law, was declared in the city in 1949. the era when bonn served as the capital of west germany is referred to by historians as the bonn republic. from 1990 to 1999, bonn served as the seat of government – but no longer capital – of reunited germany.
the headquarters of deutsche post dhl and deutsche telekom, both dax-listed corporations, are in bonn. the city is home to the university of bonn and a total of 20 united nations institutions, including headquarters for secretariat of the un framework convention climate change (unfccc), the secretariat of the un convention to combat desertification (unccd), and the un volunteers programme.
situated in the southernmost part of the rhine-ruhr region, germany's largest metropolitan area with over 11 million inhabitants, bonn lies within the german state of north rhine-westphalia, close to the border with rhineland-palatinate. spanning an area of more on both sides of the river rhine, almost three quarters of the city lie on the river's left bank.
to the south and to the west, bonn is bordering the eifel region which encompasses the rhineland nature park. to the north, bonn borders the cologne lowland. natural borders are constituted by the river sieg to the north-east and by the siebengebirge (also known as the seven hills) to the east. the largest extension of the city in north-south dimensions is and in west-east dimensions. the city borders have a total length of . the geographical centre of bonn is the bundeskanzlerplatz "(chancellor square)" in bonn-gronau.
the german state of north rhine-westphalia is divided into five governmental districts (), and bonn is part of the governmental district of cologne (). within this governmental district, the city of bonn is an urban district in its own right. the urban district of bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts (). these are bonn, bonn-bad godesberg, bonn-beuel and bonn-hardtberg.
in 1969, the independent towns of bad godesberg and beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.
bonn has an oceanic climate ("cfb"). in the south of the cologne lowland in the rhine valley, bonn is in one of germany's warmest regions.
the history of the city dates back to roman times. in about 12 bc, the roman army appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. even earlier, the army had resettled members of a germanic tribal group allied with rome, the ubii, in bonn. the latin name for that settlement, "bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the eburoni. the eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of caesar's war in gaul. after several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the ubii-settlement. during the 1st century ad, the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of bonn-castell to build a large military installation dubbed castra bonnensis, i.e., literally, "fort bonn". initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. with additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the western roman empire, possibly the mid-5th century. the structures themselves remained standing well into the middle ages, when they were called the bonnburg. they were used by frankish kings until they fell into disuse. eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of bonn's 13th-century city wall. the sterntor ("star gate") in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.
to date, bonn's roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the ancient world, i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength imperial legion and its auxiliaries. the fort covered an area of approximately . between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to barracks, stables and a military jail. among the legions stationed in bonn, the "1st", i.e. the prima legio minervia, seems to have served here the longest. units of the bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day algeria to what is now the russian republic of chechnya.
the chief roman road linking the provincial capitals of cologne and mainz cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, römerstraße). once past the south gate, the cologne–mainz road continued along what are now streets named belderberg, adenauerallee et al. on both sides of the road, the local settlement, "bonna", grew into a sizeable roman town. bonn is shown on the 4th century peutinger map.
in late antiquity, much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. the remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. during the final decades of imperial rule, the troops were supplied by franci chieftains employed by the roman administration. when the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the kingdom of the franks. from the fort, the bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the south centered around what later became the minster, grew the medieval city of bonn. local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from saint boniface via vulgar latin "*bonnifatia", but this proved to be a myth.
between the 11th and 13th centuries, the romanesque style bonn minster was built, and in 1597 bonn became the seat of the archdiocese of cologne. the city gained more influence and grew considerably. the city was subject to a major bombardment during the siege of bonn in 1689. the elector clemens august (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of baroque buildings which still give the city its character. another memorable ruler was max franz (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of bad godesberg. in addition he was a patron of the young ludwig van beethoven, who was born in bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to vienna.
in 1794, the city was seized by french troops, becoming a part of the first french empire. in 1815 following the napoleonic wars, bonn became part of the kingdom of prussia. administered within the prussian rhine province, the city became part of the german empire in 1871 during the prussian-led unification of germany. bonn was of little relevance in these years.
during the second world war, bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the german heartland from the west. the allied ground advance into germany reached bonn on 7 march 1945, and the us 1st infantry division captured the city during the battle of 8–9 march 1945.
following the second world war, bonn was in the british zone of occupation. following the advocacy of west germany's first chancellor, konrad adenauer, a former cologne mayor and a native of that area, bonn became the "de facto" capital, officially designated the "temporary seat of the federal institutions," of the newly formed federal republic of germany in 1949. however, the bundestag, seated in bonn's bundeshaus, affirmed berlin's status as the german capital. bonn was chosen as the provisional capital and seat of government despite the fact that frankfurt already had most of the required facilities and using bonn was estimated to be 95 million dm more expensive than using frankfurt. however, adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make berlin the capital of the reunified germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like frankfurt or hamburg would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in west germany for reunification.
in 1949, the parliamentary council in bonn drafted and adopted the current german constitution, the basic law for the federal republic of germany. as the political centre of west germany, bonn saw six chancellors and six presidents of the federal republic of germany. bonn's time as the capital of west germany is commonly referred to as the "bonn republic," in contrast to the "berlin republic" which followed reunification in 1990.
german reunification in 1990 made berlin the nominal capital of germany again. this decision, however, did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. while some argued for the seat of government to move to berlin, others advocated leaving it in bonn — a situation roughly analogous to that of the netherlands, where amsterdam is the capital but the hague is the seat of government. berlin's previous history as united germany's capital was strongly connected with the german empire, the weimar republic and more ominously with nazi germany. it was felt that a new peacefully united germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. additionally, bonn was closer to brussels, headquarters of the european economic community. former chancellor willy brandt caused considerable offence to the western allies during the debate by stating that france wouldn't have kept the seat of government at vichy after liberation.
the heated debate that resulted was settled by the "bundestag" (germany's parliament) only on 20 june 1991. by a vote of 338–320, the bundestag voted to move the seat of government to berlin. the vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for berlin. it also broke along generational lines as well; older legislators with memories of berlin's past glory favoured berlin, while younger legislators favoured bonn. ultimately, the votes of the eastern german legislators tipped the balance in favour of berlin.
from 1990 to 1999, bonn served as the seat of government of reunited germany. in recognition of its former status as german capital, it holds the name of federal city (). bonn currently shares the status of germany's seat of government with berlin, with the president, the chancellor and many government ministries maintaining substantial presences in bonn. over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in bonn. a total of 19 united nations (un) institutions operate from bonn today.
the city council of bonn used to be based in the rococo-style and 1737 built ' (old city hall) adjacent to bonn's central market square. however, due to the enlargement of bonn in 1969 through the incorporation of beuel and bad godesberg, it moved into the larger stadthaus facilities further up north. this was necessary for the city council to accommodate the increased number of representatives. the mayor of bonn still sits in the ', which is also used for representative and official purposes.
as of the 2014–2020 election cycle, the christian democrats (cdu) hold the majority of mandates in the city council (27 seats), followed by the social democrats (spd) with 20 seats, the greens (bündnis '90/die grünen) with 16 seats, the liberals (fdp) with 7 seats, the left (die linke) with 5 seats, the local bürgerbund bonn with 4 seats, the alternative for germany (afd) with 3 seats, and independent candidates with a total of 4 seats. there are currently 86 seats in the city council of bonn.

ballroom dance is a set of partner dances, which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world. because of its performance and entertainment aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.
"ballroom dance" may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any type of partner dancing as recreation. however, with the emergence of dancesport in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope and traditionally refers to the five international standard and five international latin style dances (see dance categories below). the two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness. developed in england, the two styles are now regulated by the world dance council (wdc) and the world dancesport federation (wdsf). in the united states, two additional variations are popular: "american smooth" and "american rhythm", which combine elements of the standard and latin styles with influences from other dance traditions.
there are also a number of historical dances, and local or national dances, which may be danced in ballrooms or salons. sequence dancing, in pairs or other formations, is still a popular style of ballroom dance.
the term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word "ball" which in turn originates from the latin word "ballare" which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). in times past, ballroom dancing was social dancing for the privileged, leaving folk dancing for the lower classes. these boundaries have since become blurred. the definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the minuet, quadrille, polonaise, polka, mazurka, and others, which are now considered to be historical dances.
the first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when jehan tabourot, under the pen name "thoinot-arbeau", published in 1588 his "orchésographie", a study of late 16th-century french renaissance social dance. among the dances described were the solemn basse danse, the livelier branle, pavane, and the galliarde which shakespeare called the "cinq pace" as it was made of five steps.
in 1650 the minuet, originally a peasant dance of poitou, was introduced into paris and set to music by jean-baptiste lully and danced by the king louis xiv in public. the minuet dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.
toward the later half of the 16th century, louis xiv founded his 'académie royale de musique et de danse', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the "five positions" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the académie. eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the court and went to the stage. ballet technique such as the turned out positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the victoria era.
the waltz with its modern hold took root in england in about 1812; in 1819 carl maria von weber wrote "invitation to the dance", which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. the dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened. in the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the polka, mazurka, and the schottische. in the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as "entrechats" and "ronds de jambes" that had found a place in the quadrilles and other dances.
modern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. the first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. this had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. the second was a wave of popular music, such as jazz. since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. there were many dance crazes in the period 1910–1930.
the third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the u.s. and europe. here vernon and irene castle were important, and so was a generation of english dancers in the 1920s, including josephine bradley and victor silvester. these professionals analysed, codified, published, and taught a number of standard dances. it was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. here the huge arthur murray organisation in america, and the dance societies in england, such as the imperial society of teachers of dancing, were highly influential. finally, much of this happened during and after a period of world war, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.
later, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of fred astaire and ginger rogers influenced all forms of dance in the u.s. and elsewhere. although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the castles, have reached iconic status. much of astaire and rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by astaire or hermes pan) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.
competitions, sometimes referred to as dancesport, range from world championships, regulated by the world dance council (wdc), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the usa pro-am competitions typically accompany professional competitions. the international olympic committee now recognizes competitive ballroom dance. it has recognized another body, the world dancesport federation (wdsf), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the olympic games. however, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the olympic games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.
ballroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. there are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. there are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the wdc and/or the wdsf, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions. in britain there is the british dance council, which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the british ballroom championships, the british sequence championships and the united kingdom championships. in the united states, the member branches of the wdc (national dance council of america) and the wdsf (usa dance) both grant national and regional championship titles.
ballroom dancing competitions in the former ussr also included the soviet ballroom dances, or "soviet programme". australian new vogue is danced both competitively and socially. in competition, there are 15 recognized new vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. these dance forms are not recognized internationally, neither are the us variations such as american smooth, and rhythm. such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.
internationally, the blackpool dance festival, hosted annually at blackpool, england is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.
formation dance is another style of competitive dance recognized by the wdsf. in this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.
in competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. the scorekeepers—called scrutineers—will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals when the skating system is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1–6, though the number of couples in the final may vary. sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.
competitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. the levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. the syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold—with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. in these levels, moves are restricted to those written in a syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. there are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. at those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.
medal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. in medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the imperial society of teachers of dancing (istd) and the united kingdom alliance (uka), each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. genres such as modern ballroom or latin are the most popular. societies such as the istd and uka also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as country & western, rock 'n roll or tap). in some north american examinations, levels include newcomer, bronze, silver, gold, novice, pre-championship, and championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.
there is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. these chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. there is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. there is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate. these competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. examples include the mit open ballroom dance competition, purdue ballroom classic, cardinal classic, berkeley classic, and harvard invitational.
"ballroom dance" refers most often to the ten dances of international ballroom (or standard) and international latin, though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five international ballroom dances. sequence dancing, which is danced predominantly in the united kingdom, and its development new vogue in australia and new zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of ballroom dancing.
in the united states and canada, the american style (american smooth and american rhythm) also exists. the dance technique used for both international and american styles is similar, but international ballroom allows only closed dance positions, whereas american smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. in addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. international latin and american rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.
other dances sometimes placed under the umbrella "ballroom dance" include nightclub dances such as lindy hop, west coast swing, nightclub two step, hustle, salsa, and merengue. the categorization of dances as "ballroom dances" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. there are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the vintage dance movement.
in europe, latin swing dances include argentine tango, mambo, lindy hop, swing boogie (sometimes also known as nostalgic boogie), and discofox. one example of this is the subcategory of cajun dances that originated in acadiana, with branches reaching both coasts of the united states.
ballroom/smooth dances are normally danced to western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the line of dance. in competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a white tie affair, with full gowns for the ladies and bow tie and tail coats for the men; though in american smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter tuxedos, vests, and other creative outfits.
latin/rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary latin american music and (in case of jive) western music. with the exception of a few traveling dances like samba and pasodoble, couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. in competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted latin outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.
waltz began as a country folk dance in austria and bavaria in the 17th century. in the early 19th century it was introduced in england. it was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. when performing the dance, the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, follow's body leaves the right side of the lead while the head is extended to follow the elbow. figures with rotation have little rise. sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing the feet together. waltz is performed for both international standard and american smooth.
viennese waltz originated in provence area in france in 1559 and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. it was introduced in england as german waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of josef and johann strauss. it is often referred to as the classic “old-school” ballroom. viennese waltz music is quite fast. slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. while natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. viennese waltz is performed for both international standard and american smooth.
tango originated in buenos aires in the late 19th century. modern argentine tango is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the lead and follow moving in harmony of the tango's passionate charging music. the tango's technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the dancers in the hips.
ballroom tango, however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and staccato movements. ballroom tango, rather than argentine tango, is performed in international competition.
the foxtrot is an american dance, believed to be of african-american origin. it was named by a vaudeville performer harry fox in 1914. fox was rapidly trotting step to ragtime music. the dance therefore was originally named as the “fox’s trot”. the foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. the partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. the dance is flat, with no rise and fall like the waltz. the walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. foxtrot is performed for both international standard and american smooth.
the quickstep is an english dance and was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the charleston. it is a fast moving dance, so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. quickstep includes the walks, runs, chasses, and turns of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, and skips. quick step is performed as an international standard dance.
the pasodoble originated from spain and its dramatic bullfights. the dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially because of its many choreographic rules. the lead plays the role of the matador while the follow takes the role of the matador's cape, the bull, or even the matador. the chassez cape refers to the lead using the follow to turn them as if they are the cape, and the apel is when the lead stomps their foot to get the bull's attention. pasodoble is performed as an international latin dance.
the spanish bolero was developed in the late 18th century out of the "seguidilla", and its popularization is attributed to court dancers such as sebastián cerezo. it became one of the most popular ballroom dances of the 19th century and saw many classical adaptations. however, by the 20th century it had become old-fashioned. a cuban music genre of the same name, bolero, which became popular in the early 20th century, is unrelated to the spanish dance.
although cuban bolero was born as a form of "trova", traditional singer/songwriter tradition from eastern cuba, with no associated dance, it soon became a ballroom favorite in cuba and all of latin america. the dance most commonly represents the couple falling in love. modern bolero is seen as a combination of many dances: like a slow salsa with contra-body movement of tango, patterns of rhumba, and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. bolero can be danced in a closed hold or singly and then coming back together. it is performed as an american rhythm dance.
samba is the national dance of brazil. the rhythm of samba and its name originated from the language and culture of west african slaves. in 1905, samba became known to other countries during an exhibition in paris. in the 1940s, samba was introduced in america through carmen miranda. the international version of ballroom samba has been based on an early version of brazilian samba called maxixe, but has since developed away and differs strongly from brazilian ballroom samba, which is called samba de gafieira. international ballroom samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. it is performed as an international latin dance, although most of its modern development has occurred outside latin america.
rhumba came to the united states from cuba in the 1920s and became a popular cabaret dance during prohibition. rhumba is a ballroom adaptation of son cubano and bolero (the cuban genre) and, despite its name, it rarely included elements of cuban rumba. it includes cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure-eight hip rotation, and swiveling foot action. an important characteristic of rhumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. rhumba is performed for both international latin and american rhythm.
mambo was developed as an offshoot of danzón, the national dance of cuba, in the late 1930s by orestes lópez and his brother cachao, of arcaño y sus maravillas. they conceived a new form of danzón influenced by son cubano, with a faster, improvised final section, which allowed dancers to more freely express themselves, given that danzón had traditionally a very rigid structure. in the 1940s, dámaso pérez prado transformed the mambo from the charanga into the big band format, and took it to mexico and the united states, where it became a "dance craze".
cha-cha-cha (sometimes called cha-cha in the us) was delevoped by enrique jorrín in the early 1950s, as a slower alternative to mambo. cha-cha-cha is a flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronising their movements. the dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of cuban motion. cha-cha is performed for both international latin and american rhythm.
swing in 1927 was originally named the lindy hop named by shorty george snowden. there have been 40 different versions documented over the years; most common is the east coast swing which is performed in the american smooth (or american rhythm) only in the u.s. or canada. the east coast swing was established by arthur murray and others only shortly after world war ii. swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. the swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. east coast swing is performed as an american rhythm dance.
the jive is part of the swing dance group and is a very lively variation of the jitterbug. jive originated from african american clubs in the early 1940s. during world war ii, american soldiers introduced the jive in england where it was adapted to today's competitive jive. in jive, the man leads the dance while the woman encourages the man to ask them to dance. it is danced to big band music, and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. jive is performed as an international latin dance.

the birth of a nation (originally called the clansman) is a 1915 american silent epic drama film directed and co-produced by d. w. griffith and starring lillian gish. the screenplay is adapted from the novel and play "", by thomas dixon jr. griffith co-wrote the screenplay with frank e. woods, and co-produced the film with harry aitken. it was released on february 8, 1915.
"the birth of a nation" is a landmark of film history. it was the first 12-reel film ever made and, at three hours, also the longest up to that point. its plot, part fiction and part history, chronicling the assassination of abraham lincoln by john wilkes booth and the relationship of two families in the civil war and reconstruction eras over the course of several years—the pro-union (northern) stonemans and the pro-confederacy (southern) camerons—was by far the most complex of any movie made up to that date. it was originally presented in two parts separated by another movie innovation, an intermission, and it was the first to have a musical score for an orchestra. it pioneered close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras (another first) made to look like thousands. it came with a 13-page "souvenir program". it was the first american motion picture to be screened in the white house, viewed there by president woodrow wilson, who, according to "legend," called the film "history written with lightning." jon meacham observed that wilson’s quote was “almost certainly manufactured.”
the film was controversial even before its release and has remained so ever since; it has been called "the most controversial film ever made in the united states". lincoln, who dixon saw as a southerner, was portrayed positively, unusual in a "lost cause" environment. but it portrayed black men (many played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women. it presented the ku klux klan (kkk) as a heroic force. there were widespread black protests against "the birth of a nation", such as in boston, while thousands of white bostonians flocked to see the film. the naacp spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film. griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce "intolerance" the following year.
it was a huge commercial success and became highly influential, to the point of reinventing the medium. the film's release has also been acknowledged as an inspiration for only months later. in 1992, the library of congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the national film registry.
the film follows two juxtaposed families. one is the northern stonemans: abolitionist u.s. representative austin stoneman (based on the reconstruction-era representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania), his daughter, and two sons. the other is the southern camerons: dr. cameron, his wife, their three sons and two daughters. phil, the elder stoneman son, falls in love with margaret cameron, during the brothers' visit to the cameron estate in south carolina, representing the old south. meanwhile, young ben cameron idolizes a picture of elsie stoneman. when the civil war arrives, the young men of both families enlist in their respective armies. the younger stoneman and two of the cameron brothers are killed in combat. meanwhile, the cameron women are rescued by confederate soldiers who rout a black militia, after an attack on the cameron home. ben cameron leads a heroic charge at the siege of petersburg, earning the nickname of "the little colonel", but he is also wounded and captured. he is then taken to a union hospital in washington, d.c.
during his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. also at the hospital, he meets elsie stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. elsie takes cameron's mother, who had traveled to washington to tend her son, to see abraham lincoln, and mrs. cameron persuades the president to pardon ben. when lincoln is assassinated at ford's theatre, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. in the wake of the president's death, austin stoneman and other radical republicans are determined to punish the south, employing harsh measures that griffith depicts as having been typical of the reconstruction era.
stoneman and his protégé silas lynch, a psychopathic mulatto, head to south carolina to observe the implementation of reconstruction policies firsthand. during the election, in which lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many whites are denied the vote. the newly elected, mostly black members of the south carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on fried chicken.
meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, ben fights back by forming the ku klux klan. as a result, elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with ben. later, flora cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a captain. he confronts flora and tells her that he desires to get married. frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by gus. trapped on a precipice, flora warns gus she will jump if he comes any closer. when he does, she leaps to her death. having run through the forest looking for her, ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the cameron home. in response, the klan hunts down gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.
lynch then orders a crackdown on the klan after discovering gus's murder. he also secures the passing of legislation allowing mixed-race marriages. dr. cameron is arrested for possessing ben's klan regalia, now considered a crime punishable by death. he is rescued by phil stoneman and a few of his black servants. together with margaret cameron, they flee. when their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former union soldiers who agree to hide them. an intertitle states, "the former enemies of north and south are united again in defense of their aryan birthright."
congressman stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with lt. gov. lynch's crackdown. elsie, learning of dr. cameron's arrest, goes to lynch to plead for his release. lynch, who had been lusting after elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. stoneman returns, causing elsie to be placed in another room. at first stoneman is happy when lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when lynch tells him that it is stoneman's daughter. undercover klansman spies go to get help when they discover elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. the klan gathered together, with ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. when news about elsie reaches ben, he and others go to her rescue. elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. lynch is captured. victorious, the klansmen celebrate in the streets. meanwhile, lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the camerons are hiding. the klansmen, with ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. the next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.
the film concludes with a double wedding as margaret cameron marries phil stoneman and elsie stoneman marries ben cameron. the masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. the scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of jesus christ. the penultimate title is: "dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial war shall rule no more. but instead — the gentle prince in the hall of brotherly love in the city of peace."

it is little known, but there was an uncompleted, lost 1911 version, titled "the clansman". it used kinemacolor and a new sound process, and one reason for this version's failure is the unwillingness of theater owners to purchase the equipment to show it. director was william f. haddock; producer was george brennan. some scenes were filmed on the porches and lawns of homewood plantation, in natchez, mississippi. 1 reels were completed.
kinemacolor received a settlement from the producers of "birth" when they proved that they had an earlier right to film the work.
the footage was shown to the trade in an attempt to arouse interest. early movie critic frank e. woods attended; griffiths always credited woods with bringing "the clansman" to his attention.
after the failure of the kinemacolor project, in which dixon was willing to invest his own money, he began visiting other studios to see if they were interested. in late 1913, dixon met the film producer harry aitken, who was interested in making a film out of "the clansman", and through aitken, dixon met griffith. like dixon, griffith was a southerner, a fact that dixon points out; griffith's father served as a colonel in the confederate states army and, like dixon, viewed reconstruction negatively. griffith believed that a passage from "the clansman" where klansmen ride "to the rescue of persecuted white southerners" could be adapted into a great cinematic sequence.
"birth of a nation" "follows "the clansman" [the play] nearly scene by scene". while some sources also credit "the leopard's spots" as source material, russell merritt attributes this to "the original 1915 playbills and program for "birth" which, eager to flaunt the film's literary pedigree, cited both "the clansman" and "the leopard's spots" as sources." according to karen crowe, "[t]here is not a single event, word, character, or circumstance taken from "the leopard's spots"... any likenesses between the film and "the leopard's spots" occur because some similar scenes, circumstances, and characters appear in both books."
griffith agreed to pay thomas dixon $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the rights to his play "the clansman". since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, griffith offered dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received [up to 2007] for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars. the american historian john hope franklin suggested that many aspects of the script for "the birth of a nation" appeared to reflect dixon's concerns more than griffith's, as dixon had an obsession in his novels of describing in loving detail the lynchings of black men, which did not reflect griffith's interests.
griffith began filming in july 1914 and was finished by october 1914. d. w. griffith took over the hollywood studio of kinemacolor. west point engineers provided technical advice on the american civil war battle scenes, providing griffith with the artillery used in the film.
griffith's budget started at us$40,000 (equivalent to $ in ) but rose to over $100,000 (the equivalent of $ in constant dollars).
although "the birth of a nation" is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary. though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical cue sheets, or less commonly, full scores (usually for organ or piano accompaniment) along with each print of a film.
for "the birth of a nation", composer joseph carl breil created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music. though it had been specifically composed for the film, breil's score was not used for the los angeles première of the film at clune's auditorium; rather, a score compiled by carli elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in west coast showings. breil's score was not used until the film debuted in new york at the liberty theatre, and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the west coast.
outside of original compositions, breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from "der freischütz" by carl maria von weber, "leichte kavallerie" by franz von suppé, symphony no. 6 by ludwig van beethoven, and "ride of the valkyries" by richard wagner, the latter used as a leitmotif during the ride of the kkk. breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many southern melodies; among these songs were "maryland, my maryland", "dixie", "old folks at home", "the star-spangled banner", "america the beautiful", "the battle hymn of the republic", "auld lang syne", and "where did you get that hat?". dj spooky has called breil's score, with its mix of dixieland songs, classical music and "vernacular heartland music" "an early, pivotal accomplishment in remix culture." he has also cited breil's use of music by richard wagner as influential on subsequent hollywood films, including "star wars" (1977) and "apocalypse now" (1979); the latter film also makes use of "ride of the valkyries".
in his original compositions for the film, breil wrote numerous leitmotifs to accompany the appearance of specific characters. the principal love theme that was created for the romance between elsie stoneman and ben cameron was published as "the perfect song" and is regarded as the first marketed "theme song" from a film; it was later used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom "amos 'n' andy".
the film premiered on february 8, 1915, at clune's auditorium in downtown los angeles. at its premiere the film was entitled "the clansman;" the title was later changed to "the birth of a nation" before the march 2 new york opening to reflect griffith's belief that the united states emerged from the american civil war and reconstruction as a unified nation. however, dixon copyrighted the title "the birth of a nation" in 1905.
"birth of a nation" was the first movie shown in the white house, in the east room, on february 18, 1915. (an earlier movie, the italian "cabiria" (1914), was shown on the lawn.) it was attended by president wilson, members of his family, and members of his cabinet. both dixon and griffiths were present. as put by dixon, not an impartial source, "it repeated the triumph of the first showing".
there is dispute about wilson's attitude toward the movie. a newspaper reported that he "received many letters protesting against his alleged action in indorsing the pictures ", including a letter from massachusetts representative thomas thacher (whose term ended march 15). the showing of the movie had caused "several near-riots". when assistant attorney general william h. lewis and a. walters, a bishop of the african methodist episcopal zion church, called at the white house "to add their protests", dr. wilson's private secretary, joseph tumulty, showed them a letter he had written to thacher on wilson's behalf. according to the letter, wilson had been "entirely unaware of the character of the play [movie] before it was presented, and has at no time expressed his approbation of it. its exhibition at the white house was a courtesy extended to an old acquaintance." dixon, in his autobiography, quotes wilson as saying, when dixon proposed showing the movie at the white house, that "i am pleased to be able to do this little thing for you, because a long time ago you took a day out of your busy life to do something for me." what dixon had done for wilson was to suggest him for an honorary degree, which wilson received, from dixon's "alma mater", wake forest college.
dixon had been a fellow graduate student in history with wilson at johns hopkins university, and in 1913 dedicated his historical novel about lincoln, "the southerner", to "our first southern-born president since lincoln, my friend and collegemate woodrow wilson".
the evidence that wilson knew "the character of the play" in advance of seeing it is circumstantial but very strong: "given dixon's career and the notoriety attached to the play "the clansman", it is not unreasonable to assume that wilson must have had some idea of at least the general tenor of the film." the movie was based on a best-selling novel and was preceded by a stage version (play) which was received with protests in several cities — in some cities it was prohibited — and received a great deal of news coverage. wilson issued no protest when the evening star, at that time washington's "newspaper of record", reported in advance of the showing, in language suggesting a press release from dixon and griffiths, that dixon was "a schoolmate of president wilson and is an intimate friend", and that wilson's interest in it "is due to the great lesson of peace it teaches". wilson, and only wilson, is quoted by name in the movie for his observations on american history, and the title of wilson's book ("history of the american people") is mentioned as well. the three title cards with quotations from wilson's book read:
"adventurers swarmed out of the north, as much the enemies of one race as of the other, to cozen, beguile and use the negroes... [ellipsis in the original.] in the villages the negroes were the office holders, men who knew none of the uses of authority, except its insolences."
"...the policy of the congressional leaders wrought…a veritable overthrow of civilization in the south...in their determination to 'put the white south under the heel of the black south.'" [ellipses and underscore in the original.]
"the white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation...until at last there had sprung into existence a great ku klux klan, a veritable empire of the south, to protect the southern country." [ellipsis in the original.]
in the same book, wilson has harsh words about the abyss between the original goals of the klan and what it evolved into. while dixon could be, and has been, accused of misquoting wilson, wilson made no protest or comment on that point.
in 1937 a popular magazine reported that wilson said of the film, "it is like writing history with lightning. and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true." wilson over the years had several times used the metaphor of illuminating history as if by lightning and he may well have said it at the time. the accuracy of his saying it was "terribly true" is disputed by historians; there is no contemporary documentation of the remark.
the next day, february 19, 1915, griffiths and dixon held a showing of the film in the raleigh hotel ballroom, which they had hired for the occasion. early that morning, dixon called on a north carolina friend, the white supremacist josephus daniels, secretary of the navy. daniels set up a meeting that morning for dixon with edward douglass white, chief justice of the supreme court. initially justice white was not interested in seeing the film, but when dixon told him it was the "true story" of reconstruction and the klan's role in "saving the south", white, recalling his youth in louisiana, jumped to attention and said: "i was a member of the klan, sir". with white agreeing to see the film, the rest of the supreme court followed. in addition to the entire supreme court, in the audience were "many members of congress and members of the diplomatic corps", the secretary of the navy, 38 members of the senate, and about 50 members of the house of representatives. the audience of 600 "cheered and applauded throughout."
in griffith's words, the showings to the president and the entire supreme court conferred an "honor" upon "birth of a nation". dixon and griffiths used this commercially.
the following day, griffiths and dixon transported the film to new york city for review by the national board of censorship. they presented the film as "endorsed" by the president and the cream of washington society. the board approved the film by 15 to 8.
a warrant to close the theater in which the movie was to open was dismissed after a long-distance call to the white house confirmed that the film had been shown there.
justice white was very angry when advertising for the film stated that he approved it and he threatened to denounce it publicly.
dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by african americans that the movie encouraged hatred against them, and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism. dixon always vehemently denied having anti-black prejudices—despite the way his books promoted white supremacy—and stated: "my books are hard reading for a negro, and yet the negroes, in denouncing them, are unwittingly denouncing one of their greatest friends".
in a letter sent on may 1, 1915, to joseph p. tumulty, wilson's secretary, dixon wrote: "the real purpose of my film was to revolutionize northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good democrat... every man who comes out of the theater is a southern partisan for life!" in a letter to president wilson sent on september 5, 1915, dixon boasted: "this play is transforming the entire population of the north and the west into sympathetic southern voters. there will never be an issue of your segregation policy". dixon was alluding to the fact that wilson, upon becoming president in 1913, had allowed cabinet members to impose segregation on federal workplaces in washington d.c. by reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.
one famous part of the film was added by griffith only on the second run of the film and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints).
these are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. the added titles read:
a plea for the art of the motion picture:
we do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the bible and the works of shakespeare
and
if in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.
various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. to nicholas andrew miller, this shows that "griffith's greatest achievement in "the birth of a nation" was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative". on the other hand, s. kittrell rushing complains about griffith's "didactic" title-cards, while stanley corkin complains that griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of liberty which he asserts.
the box office gross of "the birth of a nation" is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration. when the film opened, the tickets were sold at premium prices. the film played at the liberty theater in new york city for 44 weeks with tickets priced at $2.20 (). by the end of 1917, epoch reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million, and griffith's own records put epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was much lower than the exhibition gross. in the biggest cities, epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as "state's rights" distribution). the film historian richard schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that ""birth" certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run".
the film held the mantle of the highest-grossing film until it was overtaken by "gone with the wind" (1939), another film about the civil war and reconstruction era. by 1940 "time" magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. for years "variety" had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million. it is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total, but producer harry aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version. it is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts. in a 2015 "time" article, richard corliss estimated the film had earned the equivalent of $1.8 billion adjusted for inflation, a milestone that at the time had only been surpassed by "titanic" (1997) and "avatar" (2009) in nominal earnings.
like dixon's novels and play, "birth of a nation" received considerable criticism, both before and after its premiere. dixon, who believed it entirely truthful, attributed this to "sectionalists", i.e. non-southerners who in dixon's opinion were hostile to the truth about the south. it was to counter these "sinister forces" and the "dangerous...menace" that dixon and griffiths sought "the backing" of president wilson and the supreme court.
the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) protested at premieres of the film in numerous cities. according to the historian david copeland, "by the time of the movie's march 3 [1915] premiere in new york city, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for censorship, which began after the los angeles branch of the naacp requested the city's film board ban the movie. since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned griffith's picture". the naacp also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and reconstruction. because of the lack of success in naacp's actions to ban the film, on april 17, 1915, naacp secretary mary childs nerney wrote to naacp executive committee member george packard: "i am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to "the birth of a nation" ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere."
jane addams, an american social worker and social reformer, and the founder of hull house, voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the "new york post" on march 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released. she stated that "one of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. even then it does not tell the whole truth. it is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse." in new york, rabbi stephen samuel wise told the press after seeing "the birth of a nation" that the film was "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". in boston, booker t. washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film, while the civil rights activist william monroe trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations. on saturday, april 10, and again on april 17, trotter and a group of other blacks tried to buy tickets for the show's premiere at the tremont theater and were refused. they stormed the box office in protest, 260 police on standby rushed in, and a general melee ensued. trotter and ten others were arrested. the following day a huge demonstration was staged at faneuil hall. in washington d.c, the reverend francis james grimké published a pamphlet entitled "fighting a vicious film" that challenged the historical accuracy of "the birth of a nation" on a scene-by-scene basis. when the film was released, riots also broke out in philadelphia and other major cities in the united states. the film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. on april 24, 1916, the "chicago american" reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in lafayette, indiana, after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen "the birth of a nation". the mayor of cedar rapids, iowa was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens. the naacp set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.
both griffith and dixon in letters to the press dismissed african-american protests against "the birth of a nation". in a letter to "the new york globe", griffith wrote that his film was "an influence against the intermarriage of blacks and whites". dixon likewise called the naacp "the negro intermarriage society" and said it was against "the birth of a nation" "for one reason only—because it opposes the marriage of blacks to whites". griffith—indignant at the film's negative critical reception—wrote letters to newspapers and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions.
when sherwin lewis of "the new york globe" wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history, and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few "dirty dollars", griffith responded that "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". he also added that the man who wrote the editorial was "damaging my reputation as a producer" and "a liar and a coward".
"the birth of a nation" was very popular, despite the film's controversy; it was unlike anything that american audiences had ever seen before. the "los angeles times" called it "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed". mary pickford said: ""birth of a nation" was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously". it became a national cultural phenomenon: merchandisers made ku-klux hats and kitchen aprons, and ushers dressed in white klan robes for openings. in new york there were klan-themed balls, and in chicago that halloween, thousands of college students dressed in robes for a massive klan-themed party. the producers had 15 "detectives" at the liberty theater in new york city "to prevent disorder on the part of those who resent the 'reconstruction period' episodes depicted."
the reverend charles henry parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying that it "was exactly true to history" by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore it was a "compliment to the black man" by showing how far black people had "advanced" since reconstruction. critic dolly dalrymple wrote that, "when i saw it, it was far from silent ... incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, gasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen". one man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where flora cameron flees gus to avoid being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. katharine dupre lumpkin recalled watching the film as an 18-year-old in 1915 in her 1947 autobiography "the making of a southerner": "here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. here were the sinister men the south scorned and the noble men the south revered. and through it all the klan rode. all around me people sighed and shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity."
d. w. griffith made a film in 1916, called "intolerance", partly in response to the criticism that "the birth of a nation" received. griffith made clear within numerous interviews that the film's title and main themes were chosen in response to those who he felt had been intolerant to "the birth of a nation". a sequel called "the fall of a nation" was released in 1916. it was the first sequel in film history. the film was directed by thomas dixon jr., who adapted it from his novel of the same name. despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among american audiences, and is now a lost film.
in 1918, an american silent drama film directed by john w. noble called "the birth of a race" was released as a direct response to "the birth of a nation". the film was an ambitious project by producer emmett jay scott to challenge griffith's film and tell another side of the story, but was ultimately unsuccessful. in 1920, african-american filmmaker oscar micheaux released "within our gates", a response to "the birth of a nation". "within our gates" depicts the hardships faced by african americans during the era of jim crow laws. griffith's film was remixed in 2004 as "rebirth of a nation" by dj spooky. quentin tarantino has said that he made his film "django unchained" (2012) to counter the falsehoods of "the birth of a nation".
in november 1915, william joseph simmons revived the klan in atlanta, georgia. the historian john hope franklin observed that, had it not been for "the birth of a nation", the klan might not have been reborn.
franklin wrote in 1979 that "the influence of "birth of a nation" on the current view of reconstruction has been greater than any other single force", but that "it is not at all difficult to find inaccuracies and distortions" in the movie.
released in 1915, "the birth of a nation" has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. according to the film historian kevin brownlow, the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years". the content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatant racism. film critic roger ebert writes:
certainly "the birth of a nation" (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet.
despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics, with ebert mentioning its use as a historical tool: ""the birth of a nation" is not a bad film because it argues for evil. like riefenstahl's "triumph of the will", it is a great film that argues for evil. to understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."
according to a 2002 article in the "los angeles times", the film facilitated the refounding of the ku klux klan in 1915. history.com similarly states that "there is no doubt that "birth of a nation" played no small part in winning wide public acceptance" for the kkk, and that throughout the film "african americans are portrayed as brutish, lazy, morally degenerate, and dangerous." david duke used the film to recruit klansmen in the 1970s.
in 2013, the american critic richard brody wrote "the birth of a nation" was :
...a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. it's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. the movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and reconstruction. but they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of "birth of a nation", even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. the worst thing about "the birth of a nation" is how good it is. the merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. and it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that griffith, whose short films for biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).
brody also argued that griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the civil war when the cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of south carolina to reach the cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. likewise, brody argued that the scene where people in south carolina celebrate the confederate victory at the battle of bull run by dancing around the "eerie flare of a bonfire" which imply "a dance of death", foreshadowing the destruction of sherman's march that was to come. in the same way, brody wrote that the scene where the klan dumps gus's body off at the doorstep of lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene "obscene and horrifying". finally, brody argued that the end of the film, where the klan prevents defenseless african-africans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems "unjust and cruel".
in an article for "the atlantic", film critic ty burr deemed "the birth of a nation" the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage. richard corliss of "time" wrote that griffith "established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed. more than anyone else—more than all others combined—he invented the film art. he brought it to fruition in "the birth of a nation"." corliss praised the film's "brilliant storytelling technique" and noted that ""the birth of a nation" is nearly as antiwar as it is antiblack. the civil war scenes, which consume only 30 minutes of the extravaganza, emphasize not the national glory but the human cost of combat. ... griffith may have been a racist politically, but his refusal to find uplift in the south's war against the union—and, implicitly, in any war at all—reveals him as a cinematic humanist."
in 1992, the u.s. library of congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the national film registry. the american film institute recognized the film by ranking it #44 within the afi's 100 years...100 movies list in 1998.
the film remains controversial due to its interpretation of american history. university of houston historian steven mintz summarizes its message as follows: "reconstruction was an unmitigated disaster, blacks could never be integrated into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the ku klux klan were justified to reestablish honest government". the south is portrayed as a victim. the first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which abraham lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. however, the first aggression in the civil war, made when the confederate troops fired on fort sumter in 1861, is not mentioned in the film. the film suggested that the ku klux klan restored order to the postwar south, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and carpetbagging republican politicians from the north. this reflects the so-called dunning school of historiography. the film is slightly less extreme than the books upon which it is based, in which dixon misrepresented reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, storming into weddings to rape white women with impunity.
the film portrayed president abraham lincoln as a friend of the confederacy, and refers to him as "the great heart". the two romances depicted in the film, phil stoneman with margaret cameron and ben cameron with elsie stoneman, reflect griffith's retelling of history. the couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the north and south to defend white supremacy. among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families. with the war, however, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy. one of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity: "the former enemies of north and south are united again in defense of their aryan birthright."
the film further reinforced the popular belief held by whites, especially in the south, of reconstruction as a disaster. in his 1929 book "the tragic era: the revolution after lincoln", the respected historian claude bowers treated "the birth of a nation" as a factually accurate account of reconstruction. in "the tragic era", bowers presented every black politician in the south as corrupt, portrayed republican representative thaddeus stevens as a vicious "race traitor" intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the klan for "saving civilization" in the south. bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worst sort of "scum" from the north like stevens "inflamed the negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. rape was the foul daughter of reconstruction!"
the american historian john hope franklin wrote that not only did claude bowers treat "the birth of a nation" as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from "the birth of a nation". some historians, such as e. merton coulter in his "the south under reconstruction" (1947), maintained the dunning school view after world war ii. today, the dunning school position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many white americans held that black americans were unequal as citizens. coulter in "the south during reconstruction", which again treated "the birth of a nation" as historically correct, and painted a vivid picture of "black beasts" running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black republican politicians. franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist alistair cooke in his books and tv shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by "the birth of a nation", noting that cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how blacks were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.
veteran film reviewer roger ebert wrote:
... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the ku klux klan and its brutal images of blacks, griffith tried to make amends in "intolerance" (1916), which criticized prejudice. and in "broken blossoms" he told perhaps the first interracial love story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.
despite some similarities between the congressman stoneman character and rep. thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania, rep. stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to south carolina during reconstruction. he died in washington, d.c. in 1868. however, stevens' biracial housekeeper, lydia hamilton smith, was considered his common-law wife, and generously provided for in his will.
in the film, abraham lincoln is portrayed in a positive light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards southern whites. the president's views are opposite those of austin stoneman, a character presented in a negative light, who acts as an antagonist. the assassination of lincoln marks the transition from war to reconstruction, each of which periods has one of the two "acts" of the film. in including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis. franklin wrote the film's depiction of reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the klan stepped in is not supported by the facts. franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in reconstruction for the want of a better alternative, and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had enslaved them. the character of silas lynch has no basis in fact, and during the reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of south carolina.
the depictions of mass klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual federal troop intervention, and the organized klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders".
the civil rights movement and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar eric foner, who led a reassessment of reconstruction. building on w. e. b. dubois' work but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the african-american and white republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the south and extension of suffrage to black men. in response, the southern-dominated democratic party and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress african-american leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.
in his review of "the birth of a nation" in "1001 movies you must see before you die", jonathan kline writes that "with countless artistic innovations, griffith essentially created contemporary film language ... virtually every film is beholden to ["the birth of a nation"] in one way, shape or form. griffith introduced the use of dramatic close-ups, tracking shots, and other expressive camera movements; parallel action sequences, crosscutting, and other editing techniques". he added that "the fact that "the birth of a nation" remains respected and studied to this day-despite its subject matter-reveals its lasting importance."
griffith pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands. "the birth of a nation" also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.
for many years, "the birth of a nation" was poorly represented in home media and restorations. this stemmed from several factors, one of which was the fact that griffith and others had frequently reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. according to the silent film website "brenton film", many home media releases of the film consisted of "poor quality dvds with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in "definitely unoriginal" black and white".
one of the earliest high-quality home versions was film preservationist david shepard's 1992 transfer of a 16mm print for vhs and laserdisc release via image entertainment. a short documentary, "the making of the birth of a nation", newly produced and narrated by shepard, was also included. both were released on dvd by image in 1998 and the uk's eureka entertainment in 2000.
in the uk, photoplay productions restored the museum of modern art's 35mm print that was the source of shepard's 16 mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the british film institute. it was also given a full orchestral recording of the original breil score. though broadcast on channel 4 television and theatrically screened many times, photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.
shepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the us by kino video in 2002, this time in a 2-dvd set with added extras on the second disc. these included several civil war shorts also directed by d. w. griffith. in 2011, kino prepared a hd transfer of a 35 mm negative from the paul killiam collection. they added some material from the library of congress and gave it a new compilation score. this version was released on blu-ray by kino in the us, eureka in the uk (as part of their "masters of cinema" collection) and divisa home video in spain.
in 2015, the year of the film's centenary, photoplay productions' patrick stanbury, in conjunction with the british film institute, carried out the first full restoration. it mostly used new 4k scans of the loc's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. it, too, was given the original breil score and featured the film's original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. the restoration was released on a 2-blu-ray set by the bfi, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored civil war-related films from the period.
i've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in america, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change.

the baltic sea is a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean, enclosed by denmark, estonia, finland, latvia, lithuania, sweden, northeast germany, poland, russia and the north and central european plain.
the sea stretches from 53°n to 66°n latitude and from 10°e to 30°e longitude. a mediterranean sea of the atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the baltic sea drains through the danish islands into the kattegat by way of the straits of øresund, the great belt, and the little belt. it includes the gulf of bothnia, the bay of bothnia, the gulf of finland, the gulf of riga, and the bay of gdańsk.
the baltic proper is bordered on its northern edge, at the latitude 60°n, by the åland islands and the gulf of bothnia, on its northeastern edge by the gulf of finland, on its eastern edge by the gulf of riga, and in the west by the swedish part of the southern scandinavian peninsula.
the baltic sea is connected by artificial waterways to the white sea via the white sea canal and to the german bight of the north sea via the kiel canal.
administration
the helsinki convention on the protection of the marine environment of the baltic sea area includes the baltic sea and the kattegat, without calling kattegat a part of the baltic sea, "for the purposes of this convention the 'baltic sea area' shall be the baltic sea and the entrance to the baltic sea, bounded by the parallel of the skaw in the skagerrak at 57°44.43'n."
traffic history
historically, the kingdom of denmark collected sound dues from ships at the border between the ocean and the land-locked baltic sea, in tandem: in the øresund at kronborg castle near helsingør; in the great belt at nyborg; and in the little belt at its narrowest part then fredericia, after that stronghold was built. the narrowest part of little belt is the "middelfart sund" near middelfart.
oceanography
geographers widely agree that the preferred physical border of the baltic is a line drawn through the southern danish islands, drogden-sill and langeland. the drogden sill is situated north of køge bugt and connects dragør in the south of copenhagen to malmö; it is used by the øresund bridge, including the "drogden tunnel". by this definition, the danish straits are part of the entrance, but the bay of mecklenburg and the bay of kiel are parts of the baltic sea.
another usual border is the line between falsterbo, sweden and stevns klint, denmark, as this is the southern border of øresund. it's also the border between the shallow southern øresund (with a typical depth of 5–10 meters only) and notably deeper water.
hydrography and biology
drogden sill (depth of ) sets a limit to øresund and darss sill (depth of ), and a limit to the belt sea. the shallow sills are obstacles to the flow of heavy salt water from the kattegat into the basins around bornholm and gotland.
the kattegat and the southwestern baltic sea are well oxygenated and have a rich biology. the remainder of the sea is brackish, poor in oxygen and in species. thus, statistically, the more of the entrance that is included in its definition, the healthier the baltic appears; conversely, the more narrowly it is defined, the more endangered its biology appears.
tacitus called it "mare suebicum" after the germanic people of the suebi, and ptolemy "sarmatian ocean" after the sarmatians, but the first to name it the "baltic sea" ("mare balticum") was the eleventh-century german chronicler adam of bremen. the origin of the latter name is speculative and it was adopted into slavic and finnic languages spoken around the sea, very likely due to the role of medieval latin in cartography. it might be connected to the germanic word "belt", a name used for two of the danish straits, the belts, while others claim it to be directly derived from the source of the germanic word, latin "balteus" "belt". adam of bremen himself compared the sea with a belt, stating that it is so named because it stretches through the land as a belt ("balticus, eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per scithicas regiones tendatur usque in greciam").
he might also have been influenced by the name of a legendary island mentioned in the "natural history" of pliny the elder. pliny mentions an island named baltia (or balcia) with reference to accounts of pytheas and xenophon. it is possible that pliny refers to an island named basilia ("the royal") in "on the ocean" by pytheas. "baltia" also might be derived from "belt" and mean "near belt of sea, strait."
meanwhile, others have suggested that the name of the island originates from the proto-indo-european root "*bhel" meaning "white, fair". this root and its basic meaning were retained in both lithuanian (as "baltas") and latvian (as "balts"). on this basis, a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this indo-european root via a baltic language such as lithuanian. another explanation is that, while derived from the aforementioned root, the name of the sea is related to names for various forms of water and related substances in several european languages, that might have been originally associated with colors found in swamps (compare proto-slavic "*bolto" "swamp"). yet another explanation is that the name originally meant "enclosed sea, bay" as opposed to open sea. some swedish historians believe the name derives from the god baldr of nordic mythology.
in the middle ages the sea was known by a variety of names. the name baltic sea became dominant only after 1600. usage of "baltic" and similar terms to denote the region east of the sea started only in 19th century.
the baltic sea was known in ancient latin language sources as "mare suebicum" or even "mare germanicum". older native names in languages that used to be spoken on the shores of the sea or near it usually indicate the geographical location of the sea (in germanic languages), or its size in relation to smaller gulfs (in old latvian), or tribes associated with it (in old russian the sea was known as the varanghian sea). in modern languages it is known by the equivalents of "east sea", "west sea", or "baltic sea" in different languages:
at the time of the roman empire, the baltic sea was known as the "mare suebicum" or "mare sarmaticum". tacitus in his ad 98 "agricola" and "germania" described the mare suebicum, named for the suebi tribe, during the spring months, as a brackish sea where the ice broke apart and chunks floated about. the suebi eventually migrated southwest to reside for a while in the rhineland area of modern germany, where their name survives in the historic region known as swabia. jordanes called it the "germanic sea" in his work, the "getica".
in the early middle ages, norse (scandinavian) merchants built a trade empire all around the baltic. later, the norse fought for control of the baltic against wendish tribes dwelling on the southern shore. the norse also used the rivers of russia for trade routes, finding their way eventually to the black sea and southern russia. this norse-dominated period is referred to as the viking age.
since the viking age, the scandinavians have referred to the baltic sea as "austmarr" ("eastern lake"). "eastern sea", appears in the "heimskringla" and "eystra salt" appears in "sörla þáttr". saxo grammaticus recorded in "gesta danorum" an older name, "gandvik", "-vik" being old norse for "bay", which implies that the vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea. another form of the name, "grandvik", attested in at least one english translation of "gesta danorum", is likely to be a misspelling.)
in addition to fish the sea also provides amber, especially from its southern shores within today's borders of poland, russia and lithuania. first mentions of amber deposits on the south coast of the baltic sea date back to the 12th century. the bordering countries have also traditionally exported lumber, wood tar, flax, hemp and furs by ship across the baltic. sweden had from early medieval times exported iron and silver mined there, while poland had and still has extensive salt mines. thus the baltic sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping.
the lands on the baltic's eastern shore were among the last in europe to be converted to christianity. this finally happened during the northern crusades: finland in the twelfth century by swedes, and what are now estonia and latvia in the early thirteenth century by danes and germans (livonian brothers of the sword). the teutonic order gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the baltic sea, where they set up their monastic state. lithuania was the last european state to convert to christianity.
in the period between the 8th and 14th centuries, there was much piracy in the baltic from the coasts of pomerania and prussia, and the victual brothers even held gotland.
starting in the 11th century, the southern and eastern shores of the baltic were settled by migrants mainly from germany, a movement called the "ostsiedlung" ("east settling"). other settlers were from the netherlands, denmark, and scotland. the polabian slavs were gradually assimilated by the germans. denmark gradually gained control over most of the baltic coast, until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227 battle of bornhöved.
in the 13th to 16th centuries, the strongest economic force in northern europe was the hanseatic league, a federation of merchant cities around the baltic sea and the north sea. in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, poland, denmark, and sweden fought wars for "dominium maris baltici" ("lordship over the baltic sea"). eventually, it was sweden that virtually encompassed the baltic sea. in sweden the sea was then referred to as "mare nostrum balticum" ("our baltic sea"). the goal of swedish warfare during the 17th century was to make the baltic sea an all-swedish sea ("ett svenskt innanhav"), something that was accomplished except the part between riga in latvia and stettin in pomerania. however, the dutch dominated baltic trade in the seventeenth century.
in the eighteenth century, russia and prussia became the leading powers over the sea. sweden's defeat in the great northern war brought russia to the eastern coast. russia became and remained a dominating power in the baltic. russia's peter the great saw the strategic importance of the baltic and decided to found his new capital, saint petersburg, at the mouth of the neva river at the east end of the gulf of finland. there was much trading not just within the baltic region but also with the north sea region, especially eastern england and the netherlands: their fleets needed the baltic timber, tar, flax and hemp.
during the crimean war, a joint british and french fleet attacked the russian fortresses in the baltic. they bombarded sveaborg, which guards helsinki; and kronstadt, which guards saint petersburg; and they destroyed bomarsund in the åland islands. after the unification of germany in 1871, the whole southern coast became german. world war i was partly fought in the baltic sea. after 1920 poland was connected to the baltic sea by the polish corridor and enlarged the port of gdynia in rivalry with the port of the free city of danzig.
during world war ii, germany reclaimed all of the southern and much of the eastern shore by occupying poland and the baltic states. in 1945, the baltic sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed troop transports. the sinking of the "wilhelm gustloff" remains the worst maritime disaster in history, killing (very roughly) 9,000 people. in 2005, a russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks, sunken warships, and other material, mainly from world war ii, on the bottom of the sea.
since the end of world war ii, various nations, including the soviet union, the united kingdom and the united states, have disposed of chemical weapons in the baltic sea, raising concerns of environmental contamination. even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials: the most recent available report from the helsinki commission notes that four small scale catches of chemical munitions representing approximately of material were reported in 2005. this is a reduction from the 25 incidents representing of material in 2003. until now, the u.s. government refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites. rotting bottles leak mustard gas and other substances, thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the baltic sea.
after 1945, the german population was expelled from all areas east of the oder-neisse line, making room for displaced poles and russians. poland gained most of the southern shore. the soviet union gained another access to the baltic with the kaliningrad oblast. the baltic states on the eastern shore were annexed by the soviet union. the baltic then separated opposing military blocs: nato and the warsaw pact. had war broken out, the polish navy was prepared to invade the danish isles. this border status restricted trade and travel. it ended only after the collapse of the communist regimes in central and eastern europe in the late 1980s.
since may 2004, with the accession of the baltic states and poland, the baltic sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the european union (eu). the only remaining non-eu shore areas are russian: the saint petersburg area and the exclave of the kaliningrad oblast.
winter storms begin arriving in the region during october. these have caused numerous shipwrecks, and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry "m/s estonia" en route from tallinn, estonia, to stockholm, sweden, in september 1994, which claimed the lives of 852 people. older, wood-based shipwrecks such as the "vasa" tend to remain well-preserved, as the baltic's cold and brackish water does not suit the shipworm.
storm surge floodings are generally taken to occur when the water level is more than one metre above normal. in warnemünde about 110 floods occurred from 1950 to 2000, an average of just over two per year.
historic flood events were the all saints' flood of 1304 and other floods in the years 1320, 1449, 1625, 1694, 1784 and 1825. little is known of their extent. from 1872, there exist regular and reliable records of water levels in the baltic sea. the highest was the flood of 1872 when the water was an average of above sea level at warnemünde and a maximum of above sea level in warnemünde. in the last very heavy floods the average water levels reached above sea level in 1904, in 1913, in january 1954, on 2–4 november 1995 and on 21 february 2002.
an arm of the north atlantic ocean, the baltic sea is enclosed by sweden and denmark to the west, finland to the northeast, the baltic countries to the southeast, and the north european plain to the southwest.
it is about long, an average of wide, and an average of deep. the maximum depth is which is on the swedish side of the center. the surface area is about and the volume is about . the periphery amounts to about of coastline.
the baltic sea is one of the largest brackish inland seas by area, and occupies a basin (a "zungenbecken") formed by glacial erosion during the last few ice ages.
physical characteristics of the baltic sea, its main sub-regions, and the transition zone to the skagerrak/north sea area
the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the baltic sea as follows:
the northern part of the baltic sea is known as the gulf of bothnia, of which the northernmost part is the bay of bothnia or bothnian bay. the more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called bothnian sea and immediately to the south of it lies the sea of åland. the gulf of finland connects the baltic sea with saint petersburg. the gulf of riga lies between the latvian capital city of riga and the estonian island of saaremaa.
the northern baltic sea lies between the stockholm area, southwestern finland and estonia. the western and eastern gotland basins form the major parts of the central baltic sea or baltic proper. the bornholm basin is the area east of bornholm, and the shallower arkona basin extends from bornholm to the danish isles of falster and zealand.
in the south, the bay of gdańsk lies east of the hel peninsula on the polish coast and west of the sambia peninsula in kaliningrad oblast. the bay of pomerania lies north of the islands of usedom and wolin, east of rügen. between falster and the german coast lie the bay of mecklenburg and bay of lübeck. the westernmost part of the baltic sea is the bay of kiel. the three danish straits, the great belt, the little belt and the sound ("öresund"/"øresund"), connect the baltic sea with the kattegat and skagerrak strait in the north sea.
the water temperature of the baltic sea varies significantly depending on exact location, season and depth. at the bornholm basin, which is located directly east of the island of the same name, the surface temperature typically falls to during the peak of the winter and rises to during the peak of the summer, with an annual average of around . a similar pattern can be seen in the gotland basin, which is located between the island of gotland and latvia. in the deep of these basins the temperature variations are smaller. at the bottom of the bornholm basin, deeper than , the temperature typically is , and at the bottom of the gotland basin, at depths greater than , the temperature typically is .
on the long-term average, the baltic sea is ice-covered at the annual maximum for about 45% of its surface area. the ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the gulf of bothnia, the gulf of finland, the gulf of riga, the archipelago west of estonia, the stockholm archipelago, and the archipelago sea southwest of finland. the remainder of the baltic does not freeze during a normal winter, except sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the curonian lagoon. the ice reaches its maximum extent in february or march; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the bothnian bay, the northern basin of the gulf of bothnia, is about for landfast sea ice. the thickness decreases farther south.
freezing begins in the northern extremities of the gulf of bothnia typically in the middle of november, reaching the open waters of the bothnian bay in early january. the bothnian sea, the basin south of kvarken, freezes on average in late february. the gulf of finland and the gulf of riga freeze typically in late january. in 2011, the gulf of finland was completely frozen on 15 february.
the ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild, moderate, or severe. in severe winters ice can form around southern sweden and even in the danish straits. according to the 18th-century natural historian william derham, during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708, the ice cover reached as far as the danish straits. frequently, parts of the gulf of bothnia and gulf of finland are frozen, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the gulf of riga. this description meant that the whole of the baltic sea was covered with ice.
since 1720, the baltic sea has frozen over entirely 20 times, most recently in early 1987, which was the most severe winter in scandinavia since 1720. the ice then covered . during the winter of 2010–11, which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades, the maximum ice cover was , which was reached on 25 february 2011. the ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of gotland, with small ice-free areas on either side, and the east coast of the baltic sea was covered by an ice sheet about wide all the way to gdańsk. this was brought about by a stagnant high-pressure area that lingered over central and northern scandinavia from around 10 to 24 february. after this, strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north, and much of the waters north of gotland were again free of ice, which had then packed against the shores of southern finland. the effects of the afore-mentioned high-pressure area did not reach the southern parts of the baltic sea, and thus the entire sea did not freeze over. however, floating ice was additionally observed near świnoujście harbour in january 2010.
in recent years before 2011, the bothnian bay and the bothnian sea were frozen with solid ice near the baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it. in 2008, almost no ice formed except for a short period in march.
during winter, fast ice, which is attached to the shoreline, develops first, rendering ports unusable without the services of icebreakers. level ice, ice sludge, pancake ice, and rafter ice form in the more open regions. the gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the arctic, with wind-driven pack ice and ridges up to . offshore of the landfast ice, the ice remains very dynamic all year, and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms pack ice, made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores.
in spring, the gulf of finland and the gulf of bothnia normally thaw in late april, with some ice ridges persisting until may in the eastern extremities of the gulf of finland. in the northernmost reaches of the bothnian bay, ice usually stays until late may; by early june it is practically always gone. however, in the famine year of 1867 remnants of ice were observed as late as july 17 near uddskär. even as far south as øresund, remnants of ice have been observed in may on several occasions; near taarbaek on may 15, 1942 and near copenhagen on may 11, 1771. drift ice was also observed on may 11, 1799.
the ice cover is the main habitat for two large mammals, the grey seal ("halichoerus grypus") and the baltic ringed seal ("pusa hispida botnica"), both of which feed underneath the ice and breed on its surface. of these two seals, only the baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the baltic sea, as it feeds its young only while on ice. the grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. the sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.
the baltic sea flows out through the danish straits; however, the flow is complex. a surface layer of brackish water discharges per year into the north sea. due to the difference in salinity, by salinity permeation principle, a sub-surface layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in per year. it mixes very slowly with the upper waters, resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom, with most of the salt water remaining below deep. the general circulation is anti-clockwise: northwards along its eastern boundary, and south along the western one .
the difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh water. more than 250 streams drain a basin of about , contributing a volume of per year to the baltic. they include the major rivers of north europe, such as the oder, the vistula, the neman, the daugava and the neva. additional fresh water comes from the difference of precipitation less evaporation, which is positive.
an important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of north sea water into the baltic. such inflows, are important to the baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the baltic deeps, used to happen regularly until the 1980s. in recent decades they have become less frequent. the latest four occurred in 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2014 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.
the water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects. however, tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the baltic sea.
the significant wave height is generally much lower than that of the north sea. quite violent, sudden storms sweep the surface ten or more times a year, due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind. seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level, of the order of .
the baltic sea is the world's largest inland brackish sea. only two other brackish waters are larger on some measurements: the black sea is larger in both surface area and water volume, but most of it is located outside the continental shelf (only a small percentage is inland). the caspian sea is larger in water volume, but—despite its name—it is a lake rather than a sea.
the baltic sea's salinity is much lower than that of ocean water (which averages 3.5%), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land (rivers, streams and alike), combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about and yearly runoff is about .
the open surface waters of the baltic sea "proper" generally have a salinity of 0.3 to 0.9%, which is border-line freshwater. the flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the southwest builds up a gradient of salinity in the baltic sea. the highest surface salinities, generally 0.7–0.9%, is in the southwestern-most part of the baltic, in the arkona and bornholm basins (the former located roughly between southeast zealand and bornholm, and the latter directly east of bornholm). it gradually falls further east and north, reaching the lowest in the bothnian bay at around 0.3%. drinking the surface water of the baltic as a means of survival would actually hydrate the body instead of dehydrating, as is the case with ocean water.
as salt water is denser than fresh water, the bottom of the baltic sea is saltier than the surface. this creates a vertical stratification of the water column, a halocline, that represents a barrier to the exchange of oxygen and nutrients, and fosters completely separate maritime environments. the difference between the bottom and surface salinities vary depending on location. overall it follows the same southwest to east and north pattern as the surface. at the bottom of the arkona basin (equalling depths greater than ) and bornholm basin (depths greater than ) it is typically 1.4–1.8%. further east and north the salinity at the bottom is consistently lower, being the lowest in bothnian bay (depths greater than ) where it is slightly below 0.4%, or only marginally higher than the surface in the same region.
in contrast, the salinity of the danish straits, which connect the baltic sea and kattegat, tends to be significantly higher, but with major variations from year to year. for example, the surface and bottom salinity in the great belt is typically around 2.0% and 2.8% respectively, which is only somewhat below that of the kattegat. the water surplus caused by the continuous inflow of rivers and streams to the baltic sea means that there generally is a flow of brackish water out though the danish straits to the kattegat (and eventually the atlantic). significant flows in the opposite direction, salt water from the kattegat through the danish straits to the baltic sea, are less regular. from 1880 to 1980 inflows occurred on average six to seven times per decade. since 1980 it has been much less frequent, although a very large inflow occurred in 2014.
the rating of mean discharges differs from the ranking of hydrological lengths (from the most distant source to the sea) and the rating of the nominal lengths. göta älv, a tributary of the kattegat, is not listed, as due to the northward upper low-salinity-flow in the sea, its water hardly reaches the baltic proper:
countries that border the sea:
countries lands in the outer drainage basin:
the baltic sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area of the sea itself. about 48% of the region is forested, with sweden and finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around the gulfs of bothnia and finland.
about 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly in poland and around the edge of the baltic proper, in germany, denmark and sweden. about 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. most of the latter are in the gulfs of bothnia and finland.
the rest of the land is heavily populated. about 85 million people live in the baltic drainage basin, 15 million within of the coast and 29 million within of the coast. around 22 million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are concentrated in the band around the coast. of the nations containing all or part of the basin, poland includes 45% of the 85 million, russia 12%, sweden 10% and the others less than 6% each.
the biggest coastal cities (by population):
other important ports:
the baltic sea somewhat resembles a riverbed, with two tributaries, the gulf of finland and gulf of bothnia. geological surveys show that before the pleistocene, instead of the baltic sea, there was a wide plain around a great river that paleontologists call the eridanos. several pleistocene glacial episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. by the time of the last, or eemian stage (mis 5e), the eemian sea was in place. instead of a true sea, the baltic can even today also be understood as the common estuary of all rivers flowing into it.
from that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below. many of the stages are named after marine animals (e.g. the littorina mollusk) that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity.
the factors that determined the sea's characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the north sea-atlantic, either through the straits of denmark or at what are now the large lakes of sweden, and the white sea-arctic sea.
the land is still emerging isostatically from its depressed state, which was caused by the weight of ice during the last glaciation. the phenomenon is known as post-glacial rebound. consequently, the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing. the uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the finnish coast of the northernmost gulf of bothnia. in the area, the former seabed is only gently sloping, leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in what are, geologically speaking, relatively short periods (decades and centuries).
the "baltic sea anomaly" refers to interpretations of an indistinct sonar image taken by swedish salvage divers on the floor of the northern baltic sea in june 2011. the treasure hunters suggested the image showed an object with unusual features of seemingly extraordinary origin. speculation published in tabloid newspapers claimed that the object was a sunken ufo. a consensus of experts and scientists say that the image most likely shows a natural geological formation.
the fauna of the baltic sea is a mixture of marine and freshwater species. among marine fishes are atlantic cod, atlantic herring, european hake, european plaice, european flounder, shorthorn sculpin and turbot, and examples of freshwater species include european perch, northern pike, whitefish and common roach. freshwater species may occur at outflows of rivers or streams in all coastal sections of the baltic sea. otherwise marine species dominate in most sections of the baltic, at least as far north as gävle, where less than one-tenth are freshwater species. further north the pattern is inverted. in the bothnian bay, roughly two-thirds of the species are freshwater. in the far north of this bay, saltwater species are almost entirely absent. for example, the common starfish and shore crab, two species that are very widespread along european coasts, are both unable to cope with the significantly lower salinity. their range limit is west of bornholm, meaning that they are absent from the vast majority of the baltic sea. some marine species, like the atlantic cod and european flounder, can survive at relatively low salinities, but need higher salinities to breed, which therefore occurs in deeper parts of the baltic sea.
there is a decrease in species richness from the danish belts to the gulf of bothnia. the decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and habitats. at more than 600 species of invertebrates, fish, aquatic mammals, aquatic birds and macrophytes, the arkona basin (roughly between southeast zealand and bornholm) is far richer than other more eastern and northern basins in the baltic sea, which all have less than 400 species from these groups, with the exception of the gulf of finland with more than 750 species. however, even the most diverse sections of the baltic sea have far less species than the almost-full saltwater kattegat, which is home to more than 1600 species from these groups. the lack of tides has affected the marine species as compared with the atlantic.
since the baltic sea is so young there are only two or three known endemic species: the brown alga "fucus radicans" and the flounder "platichthys solemdali". both appear to have evolved in the baltic basin and were only recognized as species in 2005 and 2018 respectively, having formerly been confused with more widespread relatives. the tiny copenhagen cockle ("parvicardium hauniense"), a rare mussel, is sometimes considered endemic, but has now been recorded in the mediterranean. however, some consider non-baltic records to be misidentifications of juvenile lagoon cockles ("cerastoderma glaucum"). several widespread marine species have distinctive subpopulations in the baltic sea adapted to the low salinity, such as the baltic sea forms of the atlantic herring and lumpsucker, which are smaller than the widespread forms in the north atlantic.
a peculiar feature of the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial relict species, isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the baltic sea since the last glaciation, such as the large isopod "saduria entomon", the baltic subspecies of ringed seal, and the fourhorn sculpin. some of these relicts are derived from glacial lakes, such as "monoporeia affinis", which is a main element in the benthic fauna of the low-salinity bothnian bay.
cetaceans in baltic sea have been monitored by the ascobans. critically endangered populations of atlantic white-sided dolphins and harbor porpoises inhabit the sea where white-colored porpoises have been recorded, and occasionally oceanic and out-of-range species such as minke whales, bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, orcas, and beaked whales visit the waters. in recent years, very small, but with increasing rates, fin whales and humpback whales migrate into baltic sea including mother and calf pair. now extinct atlantic grey whales (remains found from gräsö along bothnian sea/southern bothnian gulf and ystad) and eastern population of north atlantic right whales that is facing functional extinction once migrated into baltic sea.
other notable megafauna include the basking sharks.
satellite images taken in july 2010 revealed a massive algal bloom covering in the baltic sea. the area of the bloom extended from germany and poland to finland. researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades. fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased eutrophication.
approximately of the baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable dead zone. the more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere. this leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone. it is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide. because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring atlantic.
plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been proposed by the university of gothenburg and inocean ab. the proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.
construction of the great belt bridge in denmark (completed 1997) and the øresund bridge-tunnel (completed 1999), linking denmark with sweden, provided a highway and railroad connection between sweden and the danish mainland (the jutland peninsula, precisely the zealand). the undersea tunnel of the øresund bridge-tunnel provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the baltic sea. the baltic sea is the main trade route for export of russian petroleum. many of the countries neighboring the baltic sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the baltic—given the slow exchange of water. the tourism industry surrounding the baltic sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution.
much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the baltic sea. the largest shipyards are at gdańsk, gdynia, and szczecin, poland; kiel, germany; karlskrona and malmö, sweden; rauma, turku, and helsinki, finland; riga, ventspils, and liepāja, latvia; klaipėda, lithuania; and saint petersburg, russia.
there are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the baltic sea, such as scandlines, silja line, polferries, the viking line, tallink, and superfast ferries.

resort towns
for the first time ever, all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention, signed in 1974 by the then seven baltic coastal states. the 1974 convention entered into force on 3 may 1980.
in the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law, a new convention was signed in 1992 by all the states bordering on the baltic sea, and the european community. after ratification the convention entered into force on 17 january 2000. the convention covers the whole of the baltic sea area, including inland waters and the water of the sea itself, as well as the seabed. measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the baltic sea to reduce land-based pollution. the convention on the protection of the marine environment of the baltic sea area, 1992, entered into force on 17 january 2000.
the governing body of the convention is the helsinki commission, also known as helcom, or baltic marine environment protection commission. the present contracting parties are denmark, estonia, the european community, finland, germany, latvia, lithuania, poland, russia and sweden.
the ratification instruments were deposited by the european community, germany, latvia and sweden in 1994, by estonia and finland in 1995, by denmark in 1996, by lithuania in 1997 and by poland and russia in november 1999.

bibliography

brackish water is water having more salinity than freshwater, but not as much as seawater. it may result from mixing seawater with fresh water together, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. the word comes from the middle dutch root "brak". certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).
technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (‰), which is a specific gravity of between 1.005 and 1.010. thus, "brackish" covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition. it is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space or time.
brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. in fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are estuaries, where a river meets the sea.
the river thames flowing through london is a classic river estuary. the town of teddington a few miles west of london marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as battersea insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as roach, dace, carp, perch, and pike. the thames estuary becomes brackish between battersea and gravesend, and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; euryhaline marine species such as flounder, european seabass, mullet, and smelt become much more common. further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent north sea and includes both euryhaline and stenohaline marine species. a similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.
this type of ecological succession from a freshwater to marine ecosystem is typical of river estuaries. river estuaries form important staging points during the migration of anadromous and catadromous fish species, such as salmon, shad, and eels, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as "nursery grounds" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. herring and plaice are two commercially important species that use the thames estuary for this purpose.
estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching. for example, atlantic salmon farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external parasites such as sea lice that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.
another important brackish water habitat is the mangrove swamp or mangal. many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are mudskippers, fish that forage for food on land, and archer fish, perch-like fish that "spit" at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as snappers, halfbeaks, and tarpon spawning or maturing among them. besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the saltwater crocodile, american crocodile, proboscis monkey, diamondback terrapin, and the crab-eating frog, "fejervarya cancrivora" (formerly "rana cancrivora"). mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.
although often plagued with mosquitoes and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.
the sundarbans and bhitarkanika mangroves are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the bay of bengal.
some seas and lakes are brackish. the baltic sea is a brackish sea adjoining the north sea. originally the confluence of two major river systems prior to the pleistocene, since then it has been flooded by the north sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine. cod are an example of a species only found in deep water in the baltic, while pike are confined to the less saline surface waters.
the caspian sea is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal seawater. the caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the caspian seal) and the great sturgeons, a major source of caviar.
the hudson bay is a brackish marginal sea of the arctic ocean, it remains brackish due its limited connections to the open ocean, very high levels freshwater surface runoff input from the large hudson bay drainage basin, and low rate of evaporation due to being completely covered in ice for over half the year.
in the black sea the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans. the deep, anoxic water of the black sea originates from warm, salty water of the mediterranean.
lake texoma, a reservoir on the border between the u.s. states of texas and oklahoma, is a rare example of a brackish lake that is neither part of an endorheic basin nor a direct arm of the ocean, though its salinity is considerably lower than that of the other bodies of water mentioned here. the reservoir was created by the damming of the red river of the south, which (along with several of its tributaries) receives large amounts of salt from natural seepage from buried deposits in the upstream region. the salinity is high enough that striped bass, a fish normally found only in salt water, has self-sustaining populations in the lake.
a brackish marsh may occur where a freshwater flow enters a salt marsh.

the bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs of new york city, in the u.s. state of new york. it is south of westchester county; northeast and east of manhattan, across the harlem river; and north of queens, across the east river. since 1914, the borough has had the same boundaries as bronx county, the third-most densely populated county in the united states.
the bronx has a land area of and a population of 1,471,160 in 2017. of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest population density. it is the only borough predominantly on the u.s. mainland.
the bronx is divided by the bronx river into a hillier section in the west, and a flatter eastern section. east and west street names are divided by jerome avenue. the west bronx was annexed to new york city in 1874, and the areas east of the bronx river in 1895. bronx county was separated from new york county in 1914. about a quarter of the bronx's area is open space, including woodlawn cemetery, van cortlandt park, pelham bay park, the new york botanical garden, and the bronx zoo in the borough's north and center. these open spaces are situated primarily on land deliberately reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from manhattan.
the name "bronx" originated with swedish-born jonas bronck, who established the first settlement in the area as part of the new netherland colony in 1639. the native lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers. in the 19th and 20th centuries, the bronx received many immigrant and migrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from various european countries (particularly ireland, germany, and italy) and later from the caribbean region (particularly puerto rico, haiti, jamaica, and the dominican republic), as well as african american migrants from the southern united states. this cultural mix has made the bronx a wellspring of latin music, hip hop and rock.
the bronx contains the poorest congressional district in the united states, the 15th, but its wide diversity also includes affluent, upper-income, and middle-income neighborhoods such as riverdale, fieldston, spuyten duyvil, schuylerville, pelham bay, pelham gardens, morris park, and country club. the bronx, particularly the south bronx, saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in a wave of arson. since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace from the 1990s until today.
the bronx was called "rananchqua" by the native siwanoy band of lenape (also known historically as "the delawares"), while other native americans knew the bronx as "keskeskeck". it was divided by the aquahung river.
the origin of the person of jonas bronck () has been contested. documents indicate that he was a swedish-born emigrant from komstad, norra ljunga parish in småland, sweden, who arrived in new netherland during the spring of 1639. bronck became the first recorded european settler in the area now known as the bronx and built a farm named "emmaus" close to what today is the corner of willis avenue and 132nd street in mott haven. he leased land from the dutch west india company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the dutch settlement of new haarlem (on manhattan island), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. he eventually accumulated between the harlem river and the aquahung, which became known as "bronck's river" or "the bronx [river]". dutch and english settlers referred to the area as "bronck's land". the american poet william bronk was a descendant of pieter bronck, either jonas bronck's son or his younger brother, but most probably a nephew or cousin, as there was an age difference of 16 years. much work on the swedish claim has been undertaken by brian g. andersson former commissioner of nyc's dept. of records, who assisted in organizing a 375th anniversary celebration in bronck's hometown in 2014.
the bronx is referred to with the definite article as "the bronx", both legally and colloquially. the county of bronx does not place "the" immediately before "bronx" in formal references, unlike the coextensive borough of the bronx, nor does the united states postal service in its database of bronx addresses (the city and state mailing-address format is simply "bronx, ny"). the region was apparently named after the bronx river and first appeared in the "annexed district of the bronx" created in 1874 out of part of westchester county. it was continued in the "borough of the bronx", which included a larger annexation from westchester county in 1898. the use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers. a time-worn story explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name stems from the phrase "visiting the broncks", referring to the settler's family.
the capitalization of the borough's name is sometimes disputed. generally, the definite article is lowercase in place names ("the bronx") except in official references. the definite article is capitalized ("the bronx") at the beginning of a sentence or in any other situation when a normally lowercase word would be capitalized. however, some people and groups refer to the borough with a capital letter at all times, such as lloyd ultan, a historian for the bronx county historical society, and the great and glorious grand army of the bronx, a bronx-based organization. these people say that the definite article is part of the proper name. in particular, the great and glorious grand army of the bronx is leading efforts to make the city refer to the borough with an uppercase definite article in all uses, comparing the lowercase article in the bronx's name to "not capitalizing the 's' in 'staten island.'"
european colonization of the bronx began in 1639. the bronx was originally part of westchester county, but it was ceded to new york county in two major parts (west bronx, 1874 and east bronx, 1895) before it became bronx county. originally, the area was part of the lenape's lenapehoking territory inhabited by siwanoy of the wappinger confederacy. over time, european colonists converted the borough into farmlands.
the development of the bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between new england and new york (manhattan). control over the bridges across the harlem river plagued the period of british colonial rule. the king's bridge, built in 1693 where broadway reached the spuyten duyvil creek, was a possession of frederick philipse, lord of philipse manor. the tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek, and in 1759, jacobus dyckman and benjamin palmer led them in building a free bridge across the harlem river. after the american revolutionary war, the king's bridge toll was abolished.
the territory now contained within bronx county was originally part of westchester county, one of the 12 original counties of the english province of new york. the present bronx county was contained in the town of westchester and parts of the towns in yonkers, eastchester, and pelham. in 1846, a new town was created by division of westchester, called west farms. the town of morrisania was created, in turn, from west farms in 1855. in 1873, the town of kingsbridge was established within the former borders of yonkers, roughly corresponding to the modern bronx neighborhoods of kingsbridge, riverdale, and woodlawn.
among famous settlers in the bronx during the 19th and early 20th centuries were author willa cather, tobacco merchant pierre lorillard, and inventor jordan l. mott, who established mott haven to house the workers at his iron works.
the consolidation of the bronx into new york city proceeded in two stages. in 1873, the state legislature annexed kingsbridge, west farms, and morrisania to new york, effective in 1874; the three towns were soon abolished in the process.
the whole territory east of the bronx river was annexed to the city in 1895, three years before new york's consolidation with brooklyn, queens, and staten island. this included the town of westchester (which had voted against consolidation in 1894) and portions of eastchester and pelham. the nautical community of city island voted to join the city in 1896.
on january 1, 1898, the consolidated city of new york was born, including the bronx as one of the five distinct boroughs (at the same time, the bronx's territory moved from westchester county into new york county, which already contained manhattan and the rest of pre-1874 new york city).
on april 19, 1912, those parts of new york county which had been annexed from westchester county in the past decades were newly constituted as bronx county, the 62nd and last county to be created by the state, effective in 1914. bronx county's courts opened for business on january 2, 1914 (the same day that john p. mitchel started work as mayor of new york city). marble hill, manhattan was now connected to the bronx, but it did not become part of that county by a historical accident due to changes in waterways.
the history of the bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom period during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. the great depression and post world war ii years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline. the mid to late century were hard times, as the bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. the bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.
the bronx was a mostly rural area for many generations, small farms supplying the city markets, but it grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century. faster transportation enabled rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to manhattan in 1904.
the south bronx was a manufacturing center for many years and was noted as a center of piano manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century. in 1919, the bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.
at the end of world war i, the bronx hosted the rather small 1918 world's fair at 177th street and devoe avenue.
the bronx underwent rapid urban growth after world war i. extensions of the new york city subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. among these groups, many irish americans, italian americans, and especially jewish americans settled here. in addition, french, german, polish, and other immigrants moved into the borough. the jewish population also increased notably during this time. in 1937, 592,185 jews lived in the bronx (43.9% of the borough's population), while only 54,000 jews lived in the borough in 2011. many synagogues still stand in the bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.
bootleggers and gangs were active in the bronx during prohibition (1920–33). irish, italian, jewish, and polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.
between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income bronxites (predominantly non-hispanic whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. this migration has left a mostly poor african american and hispanic (largely puerto rican) population in the west bronx. one significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of co-op city, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. the high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. most predominantly non-hispanic white communities today are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough.
from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the quality of life declined sharply for many bronx residents. historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that robert moses' cross bronx expressway destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in robert caro's biography "the power broker". another factor in the bronx's decline may have been the development of high-rise housing projects, particularly in the south bronx. yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the bronx, such as mortgage loans or insurance policies—a process known as redlining. others have suggested a "planned shrinkage" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting. there was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.<ref>for an example of this argument, as well as of several other theses mentioned here, see "when the bronx was burning" "city-data" forum (blog), 2007, where rubygreta writes:

bearshare was a peer-to-peer file sharing application originally created by free peers, inc. for microsoft windows and also a rebranded version of imesh by musiclab, llc, tightly integrated with their music subscription service.
the principal operators of free peers, inc. were vincent falco and louis tatta. bearshare was launched on december 4, 2000 as a gnutella-based peer-to-peer file sharing application with innovative features that eventually grew to include irc, a free library of software and media called bearshare featured artists, online help pages and a support forum integrated as dedicated web browser windows in the application; as well as a media player and a library window to organize the user's media collection.
following the june 27, 2005 united states supreme court decision on the "mgm studios, inc. v. grokster, ltd." case the bearshare community support forums were abruptly closed during negotiations to settle an impending lawsuit with the riaa. the webmaster and forum administrator immediately created a new site called technutopia and the same support staff continue to support the gnutella versions from there. a few months later the unused community window was removed from bearshare 5.1.
on may 4, 2006, free peers agreed to transfer all their bearshare-related assets to musiclab, llc (an imesh subsidiary) and use the $30 million raised from that sale to settle with the riaa.
on august 17, 2006, musiclab released a reskinned and updated version of imesh named bearsharev6 which connected to its proprietary imesh network instead of gnutella. bearsharev6 and its successors offer paid music downloads in the playsforsure drm controlled wma format as well as free content in various formats, chiefly mp3. like bearshare they also include a media player and embedded online and social networking features but with a web 2.0 style, somewhat similar to myspace or facebook. free content provided by users is automatically verified using acoustic fingerprinting as non-infringing before it can be shared. video files more than 50 mb in size and 15 minutes in length cannot be shared, ensuring television shows and feature-length movies cannot be distributed over the network. only a limited set of music and video file types can be shared, thus excluding everything else like executable files, documents and compressed archives.
in august 2006, musiclab released a variant of the original bearshare gnutella servant, called bearflix, which was altered to limit sharing, searches and downloads to images and videos. shared videos were limited in length and duration, similar to limits in bearsharev6. the first release was version 1.2.1. its version numbers appear to start from 1.1.2.1 in the user interface but it presents itself on the gnutella network as versions 6.1.2.1 to 6.2.2.530. this version has since been discontinued by musiclab and no longer available on their websites; however it remains in wide usage.
on october 27, 2008, responding to uncertainty around the future of playsforsure, musiclab added ipod support in bearsharev7.
as of june 12, 2016, bearshare is no longer available to download. the official page with a message announcing its discontinuation remained active until march 2017.
the latest version of bearshare is version 12.0.0.3093. it is downloadable as a free peer-to-peer application for windows xp and above, from downloadastro.com. the developer is listed as genericom and the software is advertised under the same logo as previous versions, though the date of last update is given as october 3, 2013. there are a range of similar applications for download under the same bearshare brand name on the same website. when installing the software the verified publisher is listed as bully unity ltd.
three variants of the original bearshare gnutella servant were distributed by free peers: free, lite and pro. the free version had higher performance limits than the lite version but contained some adware. the pro version had higher limits than both the free and lite versions but cost us$24. version numbers in this series ranged from 1.0 to 5.2.5.9. though lacking musiclab's support a wide spread of bearshare versions from 4.7 to 5.2.5.6 remain the second most popular servant on gnutella, alongside limewire.
old-school fans of the gnutella versions tend to favour the last of the beta versions, 5.1.0 beta25, because it has no adware, is hard-coded for performance levels roughly between pro and regular (ad-supported) versions and has the unique ability to switch between leaf and ultrapeer mode on demand, a feature deemed necessary for effective testing. no other gnutella servant has enjoyed this capability.
the most recent musiclab version, v10, was available by free download from their support website and "pro" features could be unlocked with a six or twelve-month subscription. access to premium content required a $9.95 monthly subscription. customers in canada and the u.s.a. could opt for a $14.95 monthly "bearshare togo" subscription which allowed downloads of premium music to portable music players.

belgium, officially the kingdom of belgium, is a country in western europe. it is bordered by the netherlands to the north, germany to the east, luxembourg to the southeast, france to the southwest, and the north sea to the northwest. it covers an area of and has a population of more than 11.4 million. the capital and largest city is brussels; other major cities are antwerp, ghent, charleroi and liège.
the sovereign state is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. it is divided into three highly autonomous regions: flanders in the north, wallonia in the south, and the brussels-capital region. brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of gdp per capita.
belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or "communities": the dutch-speaking, mostly flemish community, which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the french-speaking community, which comprises about 40 percent of all belgians. a small german-speaking community, numbering around one percent, exists in the east cantons. the brussels-capital region is officially bilingual (french and dutch), although french is the dominant language. belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance, made up of six different governments.
historically, belgium was part of an area known as the low countries, a somewhat larger region than the current benelux group of states that also included parts of northern france and western germany. its name is derived from the latin word "belgica", after the roman province of gallia belgica. from the end of the middle ages until the 17th century, the area of belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan center of commerce and culture. between the 16th and early 19th centuries, belgium served as the battleground between many european powers, earning the moniker the "battlefield of europe", a reputation strengthened by both world wars. the country emerged in 1830 following the belgian revolution when it seceded from the netherlands.
belgium participated in the industrial revolution
and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed a number of colonies in africa. the second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the dutch-speaking and the french-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of flanders and wallonia. this continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly among the flemish; controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the june 2010 federal election, a world record. unemployment in wallonia is more than double that of flanders, which boomed after the war.
belgium is one of the six founding countries of the european union and hosts the official seats of the european commission, the council of the european union, and the european council, as well as a seat of the european parliament in the country's capital, brussels. belgium is also a founding member of the eurozone, nato, oecd, and wto, and a part of the trilateral benelux union and the schengen area. brussels hosts several of the eu's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as nato.
belgium is a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy. it has very high standards of living, quality of life, healthcare, education, and is categorized as "very high" in the human development index. it also ranks as one of the safest or most peaceful countries in the world.
the name "belgium" is derived from "gallia belgica", a roman province in the northernmost part of gaul that before roman invasion in 100 bc, was inhabited by the "belgae", a mix of celtic and germanic peoples.
a gradual immigration by germanic frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the merovingian kings. a gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the franks to evolve into the carolingian empire.
the treaty of verdun in 843 divided the region into middle and west francia and therefore into a set of more or less independent fiefdoms which, during the middle ages, were vassals either of the king of france or of the holy roman emperor.
many of these fiefdoms were united in the burgundian netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries.
emperor charles v extended the personal union of the seventeen provinces in the 1540s, making it far more than a personal union by the pragmatic sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the prince-bishopric of liège.
the eighty years' war (1568–1648) divided the low countries into the northern united provinces ("belgica foederata" in latin, the "federated netherlands") and the southern netherlands ("belgica regia", the "royal netherlands"). the latter were ruled successively by the spanish (spanish netherlands) and the austrian habsburgs (austrian netherlands) and comprised most of modern belgium. this was the theatre of most franco-spanish and franco-austrian wars during the 17th and 18th centuries.
following the , the low countries—including territories that were never nominally under habsburg rule, such as the prince-bishopric of liège—were annexed by the french first republic, ending austrian rule in the region. the reunification of the low countries as the united kingdom of the netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the first french empire in 1815, after the defeat of napoleon.
in 1830, the belgian revolution led to the separation of the southern provinces from the netherlands and to the establishment of a catholic and bourgeois, officially french-speaking and neutral, independent belgium under a provisional government and a national congress. since the installation of leopold i as king on 1831, now celebrated as belgium's national day, belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, with a laicist constitution based on the napoleonic code. although the franchise was initially restricted, universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of 1893 (with plural voting until 1919) and for women in 1949.
the main political parties of the 19th century were the catholic party and the liberal party, with the belgian labour party emerging towards the end of the 19th century. french was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie. it progressively lost its overall importance as dutch became recognized as well. this recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 the parliament accepted a dutch version of the constitution.
the berlin conference of 1885 ceded control of the congo free state to king leopold ii as his private possession. from around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the congolese population under leopold ii, for whom the congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. many congolese were killed by leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. it is estimated that nearly 10 million were killed during the leopold period. in 1908, this outcry led the belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the belgian congo. a belgian commission in 1919 estimated that congo's population was half what it was in 1879.
germany invaded belgium in august 1914 as part of the schlieffen plan to attack france, and much of the western front fighting of world war i occurred in western parts of the country. the opening months of the war were known as the rape of belgium due to german excesses. belgium assumed control of the german colonies of ruanda-urundi (modern-day rwanda and burundi) during the war, and in 1924 the league of nations mandated them to belgium. in the aftermath of the first world war, belgium annexed the prussian districts of eupen and malmedy in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a german-speaking minority.
german forces again invaded the country in may 1940, and 40,690 belgians, over half of them jews, were killed during the subsequent occupation and the holocaust. from september 1944 to february 1945 the allies liberated belgium. after world war ii, a general strike forced king leopold iii to abdicate in 1951, since many belgians felt he had collaborated with germany during the war. the belgian congo gained independence in 1960 during the congo crisis; ruanda-urundi followed with its independence two years later. belgium joined nato as a founding member and formed the benelux group of nations with the netherlands and luxembourg.
belgium became one of the six founding members of the european coal and steel community in 1951 and of the european atomic energy community and european economic community, established in 1957. the latter has now become the european union, for which belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the european commission, the council of the european union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the european parliament.
belgium shares borders with france (), germany (), luxembourg () and the netherlands (). its total surface, including water area, is . before 2018, its total area was believed to be . however, when the country's statistics were measured in 2018, a new calculation method was used. unlike previous calculations, this one included the area from the coast to the low-water line, revealing the country to be larger in surface area than previously thought. its land area alone is 30,278 km. it lies between latitudes 49°30 and 51°30 n, and longitudes 2°33 and 6°24 e.
belgium has three main geographical regions; the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the anglo-belgian basin, and the ardennes uplands in the southeast to the hercynian orogenic belt. the paris basin reaches a small fourth area at belgium's southernmost tip, belgian lorraine.
the coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the campine ("kempen"). the thickly forested hills and plateaus of the ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges. extending westward into france, this area is eastwardly connected to the eifel in germany by the high fens plateau, on which the signal de botrange forms the country's highest point at .
the climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons (köppen climate classification: "cfb"), like most of northwest europe. the average temperature is lowest in january at and highest in july at . the average precipitation per month varies between for february and april, to for july. averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of and maximums of and monthly rainfall of ; these are about 1 °c and nearly 10 millimetres above last century's normal values, respectively.
phytogeographically, belgium is shared between the atlantic european and central european provinces of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom. according to the world wide fund for nature, the territory of belgium belongs to the ecoregion of atlantic mixed forests. because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the center of western europe, belgium still faces some environmental problems. however, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in belgium, the state of the environment in belgium is gradually improving. this led to belgium being ranked as one of the top 10 countries (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. belgium moreover has one of europe's highest waste recycling rates. in particular, the flemish region of belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in europe. almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.
the territory of belgium is divided into three regions, two of which, the flemish region and walloon region, are in turn subdivided into provinces; the third region, the brussels capital region, is neither a province nor a part of a province.
belgium is a constitutional, popular monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy. the bicameral federal parliament is composed of a senate and a chamber of representatives. the former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and 10 co-opted senators. prior to 2014, most of the senate's members were directly elected. the chamber's 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts. belgium has compulsory voting and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world.
the king (currently philippe) is the head of state, though with limited prerogatives. he appoints ministers, including a prime minister, that have the confidence of the chamber of representatives to form the federal government. the council of ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members. with the possible exception of the prime minister, the council of ministers is composed of an equal number of dutch-speaking members and french-speaking members.
the judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the napoleonic code. the court of cassation is the court of last resort, with the courts of appeal one level below.
belgium's political institutions are complex; most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities.
since about 1970, the significant national belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities.
the major parties in each community, though close to the political center, belong to three main groups: christian democrats, liberals, and social democrats.
further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century, mainly around linguistic, nationalist, or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature.
a string of christian democrat coalition governments from 1958 was broken in 1999 after the first dioxin crisis, a major food contamination scandal. a "rainbow coalition" emerged from six parties: the flemish and the french-speaking liberals, social democrats and greens. later, a "purple coalition" of liberals and social democrats formed after the greens lost most of their seats in the 2003 election.
the government led by prime minister guy verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget, some tax reforms, a labor-market reform, scheduled nuclear phase-out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution. restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and same-sex marriage legalized. the government promoted active diplomacy in africa and opposed the invasion of iraq. it is the only country that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia.
verhofstadt's coalition fared badly in the june 2007 elections. for more than a year, the country experienced a political crisis. this crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of belgium. from 2007 until 2008 the temporary verhofstadt iii government was in office. this coalition of the flemish and francophone christian democrats, the flemish and francophone liberals together with the francophone social democrats was an interim government until 2008.
on that day a new government, led by flemish christian democrat yves leterme, the actual winner of the federal elections of , was sworn in by the king. on 2008 leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king, as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made.
in december 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a crisis surrounding the sale of fortis to bnp paribas. at this juncture, his resignation was accepted and christian democratic and flemish herman van rompuy was sworn in as prime minister on 2008.
after herman van rompuy was designated the first permanent president of the european council on 2009, he offered the resignation of his government to king albert ii on 2009. a few hours later, the new government under prime minister yves leterme was sworn in. on 2010, leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king after one of the coalition partners, the openvld, withdrew from the government, and on 2010 king albert officially accepted the resignation.
the parliamentary elections in belgium on 2010 saw the flemish nationalist n-va become the largest party in flanders, and the socialist party ps the largest party in wallonia. until december 2011, belgium was governed by leterme's caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government. by 30 march 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government, previously held by war-torn iraq. finally, in december 2011 the di rupo government led by walloon socialist prime minister elio di rupo was sworn in.
the 2014 federal election (coinciding with the regional elections) resulted in a further electoral gain for the flemish nationalist n-va, although the incumbent coalition (composed of flemish and french-speaking social democrats, liberals, and christian democrats) maintains a solid majority in parliament and in all electoral constituencies. on 22 july 2014, king philippe nominated charles michel (mr) and kris peeters (cd&v) to lead the formation of a new federal cabinet composed of the flemish parties n-va, cd&v, open vld and the french-speaking mr, which resulted in the michel government. it is the first time n-va is part of the federal cabinet, while the french-speaking side is represented only by the mr, which achieved a minority of the public votes in wallonia.
following a usage which can be traced back to the burgundian and habsburg courts, in the 19th century it was necessary to speak french to belong to the governing upper class, and those who could only speak dutch were effectively second-class citizens. late that century, and continuing into the 20th century, flemish movements evolved to counter this situation.
while the people in southern belgium spoke french or dialects of french, and most brusselers adopted french as their first language, the flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making dutch an equal language in the education system. following world war ii, belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities. intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimize the potential for conflict.
based on the four language areas defined in 1962–63 (the dutch, bilingual, french and german language areas), consecutive revisions of the country's constitution in 1970, 1980, 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels:
the constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters. although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the communities and regions were created in 1980, flemish politicians decided to merge both. thus the flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.
the overlapping boundaries of the regions and communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the brussels-capital region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the flemish and french communities, and the territory of the german-speaking community lies wholly within the walloon region. conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the constitutional court of belgium. the structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.
the federal state's authority includes justice, defense, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. state-owned companies include the belgian post group and belgian railways. the federal government is responsible for the obligations of belgium and its federalized institutions towards the european union and nato. it controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs. the budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. the federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants.
communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language. extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, and so on.).
regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. these include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. they supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.
in several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. with education, for instance, the autonomy of the communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters. each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. the treaty-making power of the regions' and communities' governments is the broadest of all the federating units of all the federations all over the world.
because of its location at the crossroads of western europe, belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbors. with virtually defenseless borders, belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation. the belgians have been strong advocates of european integration. both the european union and nato are headquartered in belgium.
the belgian armed forces have about 47,000 active troops. in 2010, belgium's defense budget totaled €3.95 billion (representing 1.12% of its gdp). they are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components: land component, or the army; air component, or the air force; naval component, or the navy; medical component. the operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the staff department for operations and training of the ministry of defense, which is headed by the assistant chief of staff operations and training, and to the chief of defense.
the effects of the second world war made collective security a priority for belgian foreign policy. in march 1948 belgium signed the treaty of brussels, and then joined nato in 1948. however the integration of the armed forces into nato did not begin until after the korean war. the belgians, along with the luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in korea known as the belgian united nations command. this mission was the first in a long line of un missions which the belgians supported. currently, the belgian naval component is working closely together with the dutch navy under the command of the admiral benelux.
belgium's strongly globalized economy and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of europe. its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world's 15th largest trading nation in 2007. the economy is characterized by a highly productive work force, high gnp and high exports per capita. belgium's main imports are raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and oil products. its main exports are machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and foodstuffs.
the belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic flemish economy and a walloon economy that lags behind. one of the founding members of the european union, belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of eu institutions to integrate member economies. since 1922, through the belgium-luxembourg economic union, belgium and luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union.
belgium was the first continental european country to undergo the industrial revolution, in the early 19th century. liège and charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century in the sambre and meuse valley and made belgium among one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910. however, by the 1840s the textile industry of flanders was in severe crisis, and the region experienced famine from 1846 to 1850.
after world war ii, ghent and antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. the 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession; it was particularly prolonged in wallonia, where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline. in the 1980s and 1990s, the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous flemish diamond area.
by the end of the 1980s, belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of gdp. , the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of gdp. in 2005 and 2006, real gdp growth rates of 1.5% and 3.0%, respectively, were slightly above the average for the euro area. unemployment rates of 8.4% in 2005 and 8.2% in 2006 were close to the area average. by , this had grown to 8.5% compared to an average rate of 9.6% for the european union as a whole (eu 27). from 1832 until 2002, belgium's currency was the belgian franc. belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. the standard belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch (first king albert ii, since 2013 king philippe).
despite an 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999, belgium still had in 1999 the highest rail network density within the european union with 113.8 km/1 000 km. on the other hand, the same period, 1970–1999, has seen a huge growth (+56%) of the motorway network. in 1999, the density of km motorways per 1000 km and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the eu's means of 13.7 and 15.9.
belgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in europe. in 2010, commuters to the cities of brussels and antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams. like in most small european countries, more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport, the brussels airport. the ports of antwerp and zeebrugge (bruges) share more than 80% of belgian maritime traffic, antwerp being the second european harbor with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years. in 2016, the port of antwerp handled 214 million tons after a year-on-year growth of 2.7%.
there is a large economic gap between flanders and wallonia. wallonia was historically wealthy compared to flanders, mostly due to its heavy industries, but the decline of the steel industry post-world war ii led to the region's rapid decline, whereas flanders rose swiftly. since then, flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in europe, whereas wallonia has been languishing. as of 2007, the unemployment rate of wallonia is over double that of flanders. the divide has played a key part in the tensions between the flemish and walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. pro-independence movements have gained high popularity in flanders as a consequence. the separatist new flemish alliance (n-va) party for instance is the largest party in belgium.
contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country's history. the 16th century early modern flourishing of western europe included cartographer gerardus mercator, anatomist andreas vesalius, herbalist rembert dodoens and mathematician simon stevin among the most influential scientists.
chemist ernest solvay and engineer zenobe gramme (école industrielle de liège) gave their names to the solvay process and the gramme dynamo, respectively, in the 1860s. bakelite was developed in 1907–1909 by leo baekeland. ernest solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the solvay institute of sociology, the solvay brussels school of economics and management and the international solvay institutes for physics and chemistry which are now part of the université libre de bruxelles. in 1911, he started a series of conferences, the solvay conferences on physics and chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry. a major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a belgian, monsignor georges lemaître (catholic university of louvain), who is credited with proposing the big bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.
three nobel prizes in physiology or medicine were awarded to belgians: jules bordet (université libre de bruxelles) in 1919, corneille heymans (university of ghent) in 1938 and albert claude (université libre de bruxelles) together with christian de duve (université catholique de louvain) in 1974. françois englert (université libre de bruxelles) was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2013. ilya prigogine (université libre de bruxelles) was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1977. two belgian mathematicians have been awarded the fields medal: pierre deligne in 1978 and jean bourgain in 1994.
, the total population of belgium according to its population register was 11,376,070. almost all of the population is urban, at 97% in 2004. the population density of belgium is 373 per square kilometre (966 per square mile) . the most densely inhabited area is flanders. the ardennes have the lowest density. , the flemish region had a population of 6,552,967, its most populous cities being antwerp (523,248), ghent (260,341) and bruges (118,284). wallonia had 3,624,377 with charleroi (201,816), liège (197,355) and namur (110,939), its most populous cities. brussels has 1,198,726 inhabitants in the capital region's 19 municipalities, three of which have over 100,000 residents.
in 2017 the average total fertility rate (tfr) across belgium was 1.64 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.87 children born per woman in 1873. belgium subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 41.5 years.
, nearly 92% of the population had belgian citizenship, and other european union member citizens account for around 6%. the prevalent foreign nationals were italian (171,918), french (125,061), dutch (116,970), moroccan (80,579), portuguese (43,509), spanish (42,765), turkish (39,419) and german (37,621). in 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. of these, 685,000 (6.4%) were born outside the eu and 695,000 (6.5%) were born in another eu member state.
at the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e. 2.8 million "new belgians". of these new belgians, 1,200,000 are of european ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-western countries (most of them from morocco, turkey, and the dr congo). since the modification of the belgian nationality law in 1984 more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired belgian citizenship. the largest group of immigrants and their descendants in belgium are moroccans. 89.2% of inhabitants of turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of moroccan background, 75.4% of italians, 56.2% of the french and 47.8% of dutch people.
belgium has three official languages: dutch, french and german. a number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.
as no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of belgium's three official languages or their dialects. however, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may provide suggested figures. an estimated 60% of the belgian population are native speakers of dutch (often referred to as flemish), and 40% of the population speaks french natively. french-speaking belgians are often referred to as walloons, although the french speakers in brussels are not walloons.
the total number of native dutch speakers is estimated to be about 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern flanders region, while native french speakers number 3.32 million in wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual brussels-capital region. the german-speaking community is made up of 73,000 people in the east of the walloon region; around 10,000 german and 60,000 belgian nationals are speakers of german. roughly 23,000 more german speakers live in municipalities near the official community.
both belgian dutch and belgian french have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the netherlands and france. many flemish people still speak dialects of dutch in their local environment. walloon, considered either as a dialect of french or a distinct romance language, is now only understood and spoken occasionally, mostly by elderly people. walloon is divided into four dialects, which along with those of picard, are rarely used in public life and have largely been replaced by french.
since the country's independence, roman catholicism, counterbalanced by strong freethought movements, has had an important role in belgium's politics. however belgium is largely a secular country as the "laicist" constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. during the reigns of albert i and baudouin, the belgian royal family had a reputation of deeply rooted catholicism.
roman catholicism has traditionally been belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in flanders. however, by 2009 sunday church attendance was 5% for belgium in total; 3% in brussels, and 5.4% in flanders. church attendance in 2009 in belgium was roughly half of the sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of belgium in 1998). despite the drop in church attendance, catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of belgium's culture.
according to the eurobarometer 2010, 37% of belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a god. 31% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life-force. 27% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life-force. 5% did not respond. according to the eurobarometer 2015, 60.7% of the total population of belgium adhered to christianity, with roman catholicism being the largest denomination with 52.9%. protestants comprised 2.1% and orthodox christians were the 1.6% of the total. non-religious people comprised the 32.0% of the population and were divided between atheists (14.9%) and agnostics (17.1%). a further 5.2% of the population was muslim and 2.1% were believers in other religions. the same survey held in 2012 found that christianity was the largest religion in belgium accounting 65% of belgians.
symbolically and materially, the roman catholic church remains in a favorable position. belgium officially recognizes three religions: christianity (catholic, protestantism, orthodox churches and anglicanism), islam and judaism.
in the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 jews in belgium. the jewish community of antwerp (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in europe, and one of the last places in the world where yiddish is the primary language of a large jewish community (mirroring certain orthodox and hasidic communities in new york, new jersey, and israel). in addition most jewish children in antwerp receive a jewish education. there are several jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in antwerp) in the country.
a 2006 inquiry in flanders, considered to be a more religious region than wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that god created the universe. on the other hand, wallonia has become one of europe's most secular/least religious regions. most of the french-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. this is particularly the case in eastern wallonia and areas along the french border.
a 2008 estimate found that approximately 6% of the belgian population (628,751 people) is muslim. muslims constitute 23.6% of the population of brussels, 4.9% of wallonia and 5.1% of flanders. the majority of belgian muslims live in the major cities, such as antwerp, brussels and charleroi. the largest group of immigrants in belgium are moroccans, with 400,000 people. the turks are the third largest group, and the second largest muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.
the belgians enjoy good health. according to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years. since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the european average, grown by two months per year. death in belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.
healthcare in belgium is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. health insurance is compulsory. health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university and semi-private hospitals. health care service are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions, but for ineligible categories (of patients and services) so-called 3rd party payment systems exist. the belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government, the flemish and walloon regional governments; and the german community also has (indirect) oversight and responsibilities.
for the first time in belgian history, the first child was euthanized following the 2 year mark of the removal of the euthanization age restrictions. the child had been euthanized due to an incurable disease that was inflicted upon the child. although there may have been some support for the euthanization there is a possibility of controversy due to the issue revolving around the subject of assisted suicide.
education is compulsory from 6 to 18 years of age for belgians. among oecd countries in 2002, belgium had the third highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in postsecondary education, at 42%. though an estimated 99% of the adult population is literate, concern is rising over functional illiteracy. the programme for international student assessment (pisa), coordinated by the oecd, currently ranks belgium's education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the oecd average. education being organized separately by each, the flemish community scores noticeably above the french and german-speaking communities.
mirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century belgian political landscape, characterized by the liberal and the catholic parties, the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment. the secular branch of schooling is controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, while religious, mainly catholic branch education, is organized by religious authorities, although subsidized and supervised by the communities.
despite its political and linguistic divisions, the region corresponding to today's belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on european art and culture. nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced. since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the royal military academy and the antwerp maritime academy, no common media and no single large cultural or scientific organization in which both main communities are represented.
contributions to painting and architecture have been especially rich. the mosan art, the early netherlandish, the flemish renaissance and baroque painting and major examples of romanesque, gothic, renaissance and baroque architecture are milestones in the history of art. while the 15th century's art in the low countries is dominated by the religious paintings of jan van eyck and rogier van der weyden, the 16th century is characterized by a broader panel of styles such as peter breughel's landscape paintings and lambert lombard's representation of the antique. though the baroque style of peter paul rubens and anthony van dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the southern netherlands, it gradually declined thereafter.
during the 19th and 20th centuries many original romantic, expressionist and surrealist belgian painters emerged, including james ensor and other artists belonging to the les xx group, constant permeke, paul delvaux and rené magritte. the avant-garde cobra movement appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor panamarenko remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art. multidisciplinary artists jan fabre, wim delvoye and the painter luc tuymans are other internationally renowned figures on the contemporary art scene.
belgian contributions to architecture also continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of victor horta and henry van de velde, who were major initiators of the art nouveau style.
the vocal music of the franco-flemish school developed in the southern part of the low countries and was an important contribution to renaissance culture. in the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as henri vieuxtemps, eugène ysaÿe and arthur grumiaux, while adolphe sax invented the saxophone in 1846. the composer césar franck was born in liège in 1822. contemporary popular music in belgium is also of repute. jazz musician toots thielemans and singer jacques brel have achieved global fame. nowadays, singer stromae has been a musical revelation in europe and beyond, having great success. in rock/pop music, telex, front 242, k's choice, hooverphonic, zap mama, soulwax and deus are well known. in the heavy metal scene, bands like machiavel, channel zero and enthroned have a worldwide fan-base.
belgium has produced several well-known authors, including the poets emile verhaeren, robert goffin and novelists hendrik conscience, georges simenon, suzanne lilar, hugo claus and amélie nothomb. the poet and playwright maurice maeterlinck won the nobel prize in literature in 1911. "the adventures of tintin" by hergé is the best known of franco-belgian comics, but many other major authors, including peyo ("the smurfs"), andré franquin ("gaston lagaffe"), dupa ("cubitus"), morris ("lucky luke"), greg ("achille talon"), lambil ("les tuniques bleues"), edgar p. jacobs and willy vandersteen brought the belgian cartoon strip industry a worldwide fame.
belgian cinema has brought a number of mainly flemish novels to life on-screen. other belgian directors include andré delvaux, stijn coninx, luc and jean-pierre dardenne; well-known actors include jean-claude van damme, jan decleir and marie gillain; and successful films include "bullhead, man bites dog" and "the alzheimer affair". in the 1980s, antwerp's royal academy of fine arts produced important fashion trendsetters, known as the antwerp six.
folklore plays a major role in belgium's cultural life: the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, 'ommegangs' and 'ducasses', 'kermesse' and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or mythological background. the carnival of binche with its famous gilles and the 'processional giants and dragons' of ath, brussels, dendermonde, mechelen and mons are recognized by unesco as masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.
other examples are the carnival of aalst; the still very religious processions of the holy blood in bruges, virga jesse basilica in hasselt and basilica of our lady of hanswijk in mechelen; festival in liège; and the walloon festival in namur. originated in 1832 and revived in the 1960s, the gentse feesten have become a modern tradition. a major non-official holiday is the saint nicholas day, a festivity for children and, in liège, for students.
many highly ranked belgian restaurants can be found in the most influential restaurant guides, such as the michelin guide. belgium is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles and french fries with mayonnaise. contrary to their name, french fries are claimed to have originated in belgium, although their exact place of origin is uncertain. the national dishes are "steak and fries with salad", and "mussels with fries".
brands of belgian chocolate and pralines, like côte d'or, neuhaus, leonidas and godiva are famous, as well as independent producers such as burie and del rey in antwerp and mary's in brussels. belgium produces over 1100 varieties of beer. the trappist beer of the abbey of westvleteren has repeatedly been rated the world's best beer.
the biggest brewer in the world by volume is anheuser-busch inbev, based in leuven.
since the 1970s, sports clubs and federations are organized separately within each language community. association football is the most popular sport in both parts of belgium; also very popular are cycling, tennis, swimming, judo and basketball.
belgians hold the most tour de france victories of any country except france. they have also the most victories on the uci road world championships. philippe gilbert is the 2012 world champion. another modern well-known belgian cyclist is tom boonen. with five victories in the tour de france and numerous other cycling records, belgian cyclist eddy merckx is regarded as one of the greatest cyclists of all time. jean-marie pfaff, a former belgian goalkeeper, is considered one of the greatest in the history of association football.
belgium hosted the 1972 european football championships, and co-hosted the 2000 european championships with the netherlands. the belgium national football team reached first place in the fifa world rankings for the first time in november 2015.
kim clijsters and justine henin both were player of the year in the women's tennis association as they were ranked the number one female tennis player.
the spa-francorchamps motor-racing circuit hosts the formula one world championship belgian grand prix. the belgian driver, jacky ickx, won eight grands prix and six 24 hours of le mans and finished twice as runner-up in the formula one world championship. belgium also has a strong reputation in, motocross with the rider stefan everts. sporting events annually held in belgium include the memorial van damme athletics competition, the belgian grand prix formula one, and a number of classic cycle races such as the tour of flanders and liège–bastogne–liège. the 1920 summer olympics were held in antwerp. the 1977 european basketball championship was held in liège and ostend.

blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the deep south of the united states around the 1870s by african americans from roots in african musical traditions, african-american work songs, and spirituals. blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. the blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound. blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.
blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. it was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the aab pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by african-americans.
many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the music of africa. the origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the afro-american community, the spirituals. the first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and, later, the development of juke joints. it is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. the first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. blues subgenres include country blues, such as delta blues and piedmont blues, as well as urban blues styles such as chicago blues and west coast blues. world war ii marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. in the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock developed, which blended blues styles with rock music.
the term "blues" may have come from "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in george colman's one-act farce "blue devils" (1798). the phrase "blue devils" may also have been derived from britain in the 1600s, when the term referred to the "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal". as time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and "it came to mean a state of agitation or depression." by the 1800s in the united states, the term "blues" was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase "blue law", which prohibits the sale of alcohol on sunday. though the use of the phrase in african-american music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when hart wand's "dallas blues" became the first copyrighted blues composition.
in lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood. it is in this sense of a sad state of mind that one of the earliest recorded references to "the blues" was written by charlotte forten, then aged 25, in her diary on december 14, 1862. she was a free-born black from pennsylvania who was working as a schoolteacher in south carolina, instructing both slaves and freedmen, and wrote that she "came home with the blues" because she felt lonesome and pitied herself. she overcame her depression and later noted a number of songs, such as "poor rosy", that were popular among the slaves. although she admitted being unable to describe the manner of singing she heard, forten wrote that the songs "can't be sung without a full heart and a troubled spirit", conditions that have inspired countless blues songs.
the lyrics of early traditional blues verses probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times. it was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called "aab" pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. two of the first published blues songs, "dallas blues" (1912) and "saint louis blues" (1914), were 12-bar blues with the aab lyric structure. w.c. handy wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times. the lines are often sung following a pattern closer to rhythmic talk than to a melody.
early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative. african-american singers voiced his or her "personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the cruelty of police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk, [and] hard times". this melancholy has led to the suggestion of an igbo origin for blues because of the reputation the igbo had throughout plantations in the americas for their melancholic music and outlook on life when they were enslaved.
the lyrics often relate troubles experienced within african american society. for instance blind lemon jefferson's "rising high water blues" (1927) tells of the great mississippi flood of 1927:
although the blues gained an association with misery and oppression, the lyrics could also be humorous and raunchy:
hokum blues celebrated both comedic lyrical content and a boisterous, farcical performance style. tampa red's classic "tight like that" (1928) is a sly wordplay with the double meaning of being "tight" with someone coupled with a more salacious physical familiarity. blues songs with sexually explicit lyrics were known as dirty blues. the lyrical content became slightly simpler in postwar blues, which tended to focus on relationship woes or sexual worries. lyrical themes that frequently appeared in prewar blues, such as economic depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods and drought, were less common in postwar blues.
the writer ed morales claimed that yoruba mythology played a part in early blues, citing robert johnson's "cross road blues" as a "thinly veiled reference to eleggua, the orisha in charge of the crossroads". however, the christian influence was far more obvious. the repertoires of many seminal blues artists, such as charley patton and skip james, included religious songs or spirituals. reverend gary davis and blind willie johnson are examples of artists often categorized as blues musicians for their music, although their lyrics clearly belong to spirituals.
the blues form is a cyclic musical form in which a repeating progression of chords mirrors the call and response scheme commonly found in african and african-american music. during the first decades of the 20th century blues music was not clearly defined in terms of a particular chord progression. with the popularity of early performers, such as bessie smith, use of the twelve-bar blues spread across the music industry during the 1920s and 30s. other chord progressions, such as 8-bar forms, are still considered blues; examples include "how long blues", "trouble in mind", and big bill broonzy's "key to the highway". there are also 16-bar blues, such as ray charles's instrumental "sweet 16 bars" and herbie hancock's "watermelon man". idiosyncratic numbers of bars are occasionally used, such as the 9-bar progression in "sitting on top of the world", by walter vinson.
the basic 12-bar lyric framework of a blues composition is reflected by a standard harmonic progression of 12 bars in a 4/4 time signature. the blues chords associated to a twelve-bar blues are typically a set of three different chords played over a 12-bar scheme. they are labeled by roman numbers referring to the degrees of the progression. for instance, for a blues in the key of c, c is the tonic chord (i) and f is the subdominant (iv).
the last chord is the dominant (v) turnaround, marking the transition to the beginning of the next progression. the lyrics generally end on the last beat of the tenth bar or the first beat of the 11th bar, and the final two bars are given to the instrumentalist as a break; the harmony of this two-bar break, the turnaround, can be extremely complex, sometimes consisting of single notes that defy analysis in terms of chords.
much of the time, some or all of these chords are played in the harmonic seventh (7th) form. the use of the harmonic seventh interval is characteristic of blues and is popularly called the "blues seven". blues seven chords add to the harmonic chord a note with a frequency in a 7:4 ratio to the fundamental note. at a 7:4 ratio, it is not close to any interval on the conventional western diatonic scale. for convenience or by necessity it is often approximated by a minor seventh interval or a dominant seventh chord.
in melody, blues is distinguished by the use of the flattened third, fifth and seventh of the associated major scale.
blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and call-and-response, and they form a repetitive effect called a groove. characteristic of the blues since its afro-american origins, the shuffles played a central role in swing music. the simplest shuffles, which were the clearest signature of the r&b wave that started in the mid-1940s, were a three-note riff on the bass strings of the guitar. when this riff was played over the bass and the drums, the groove "feel" was created. shuffle rhythm is often vocalized as ""dow", da "dow", da "dow", da" or ""dump", da "dump", da "dump", da": it consists of uneven, or "swung", eighth notes. on a guitar this may be played as a simple steady bass or it may add to that stepwise quarter note motion from the fifth to the sixth of the chord and back.
the first publication of blues sheet music may have been "i got the blues", published by new orleans musician antonio maggio in 1908 and described as "the earliest published composition known to link the condition of having the blues to the musical form that would become popularly known as 'the blues.'" hart wand's "dallas blues" was published in 1912; w.c. handy's "the memphis blues" followed in the same year. the first recording by an african american singer was mamie smith's 1920 rendition of perry bradford's "crazy blues". but the origins of the blues were some decades earlier, probably around 1890. this music is poorly documented, partly because of racial discrimination in u.s. society, including academic circles, and partly because of the low rate of literacy among rural african americans at the time.
reports of blues music in southern texas and the deep south were written at the dawn of the 20th century. charles peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at clarksdale, mississippi, and gate thomas reported similar songs in southern texas around 1901–1902. these observations coincide more or less with the recollections of jelly roll morton, who said he first heard blues music in new orleans in 1902; ma rainey, who remembered first hearing the blues in the same year in missouri; and w.c. handy, who first heard the blues in tutwiler, mississippi, in 1903. the first extensive research in the field was performed by howard w. odum, who published an anthology of folk songs from lafayette county, mississippi, and newton county, georgia, between 1905 and 1908. the first noncommercial recordings of blues music, termed "proto-blues" by paul oliver, were made by odum for research purposes at the very beginning of the 20th century. they are now lost.
other recordings that are still available were made in 1924 by lawrence gellert. later, several recordings were made by robert w. gordon, who became head of the archive of american folk songs of the library of congress. gordon's successor at the library was john lomax. in the 1930s, lomax and his son alan made a large number of non-commercial blues recordings that testify to the huge variety of proto-blues styles, such as field hollers and ring shouts. a record of blues music as it existed before 1920 can also be found in the recordings of artists such as lead belly and henry thomas. all these sources show the existence of many different structures distinct from twelve-, eight-, or sixteen-bar.
the social and economic reasons for the appearance of the blues are not fully known. the first appearance of the blues is usually dated after the emancipation act of 1863, between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with post-emancipation and later, the establishment of juke joints as places where blacks went to listen to music, dance, or gamble after a hard day's work. this period corresponds to the transition from slavery to sharecropping, small-scale agricultural production, and the expansion of railroads in the southern united states. several scholars characterize the development of blues music in the early 1900s as a move from group performance to individualized performance. they argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people.
according to lawrence levine, "there was a direct relationship between the national ideological emphasis upon the individual, the popularity of booker t. washington's teachings, and the rise of the blues." levine stated that "psychologically, socially, and economically, african-americans were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it is hardly surprising that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did."
there are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performers. however, there are some characteristics that were present long before the creation of the modern blues. call-and-response shouts were an early form of blues-like music; they were a "functional expression ... style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure". a form of this pre-blues was heard in slave ring shouts and field hollers, expanded into "simple solo songs laden with emotional content".
blues has evolved from the unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves imported from west africa and rural blacks into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, with regional variations across the united states. although blues (as it is now known) can be seen as a musical style based on both european harmonic structure and the african call-and-response tradition that transformed into an interplay of voice and guitar, the blues form itself bears no resemblance to the melodic styles of the west african griots, and the influences are faint and tenuous. additionally, there are theories that the four-beats-per-measure structure of the blues might have its origins in the native american tradition of pow wow drumming.
no specific african musical form can be identified as the single direct ancestor of the blues. however the call-and-response format can be traced back to the music of africa. that blue notes predate their use in blues and have an african origin is attested to by "a negro love song", by the english composer samuel coleridge-taylor, from his "african suite for piano", written in 1898, which contains blue third and seventh notes.
the diddley bow (a homemade one-stringed instrument found in parts of the american south in the early twentieth century) and the banjo are african-derived instruments that may have helped in the transfer of african performance techniques into the early blues instrumental vocabulary. the banjo seems to be directly imported from west african music. it is similar to the musical instrument that griots and other africans such as the igbo played (called halam or akonting by african peoples such as the wolof, fula and mandinka). however, in the 1920s, when country blues began to be recorded, the use of the banjo in blues music was quite marginal and limited to individuals such as papa charlie jackson and later gus cannon.
blues music also adopted elements from the "ethiopian airs", minstrel shows and negro spirituals, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment. the style also was closely related to ragtime, which developed at about the same time, though the blues better preserved "the original melodic patterns of african music".
the musical forms and styles that are now considered the blues as well as modern country music arose in the same regions of the southern united states during the 19th century. recorded blues and country music can be found as far back as the 1920s, when the record industry created the marketing categories "race music" and "hillbilly music" to sell music by blacks for blacks and by whites for whites, respectively. at the time, there was no clear musical division between "blues" and "country", except for the ethnicity of the performer, and even that was sometimes documented incorrectly by record companies.
though musicologists can now attempt to define the blues narrowly in terms of certain chord structures and lyric forms thought to have originated in west africa, audiences originally heard the music in a far more general way: it was simply the music of the rural south, notably the mississippi delta. black and white musicians shared the same repertoire and thought of themselves as "songsters" rather than blues musicians. the notion of blues as a separate genre arose during the black migration from the countryside to urban areas in the 1920s and the simultaneous development of the recording industry. "blues" became a code word for a record designed to sell to black listeners.
the origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of afro-american community, the spirituals. the origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were christianized and began to sing and play christian hymns, in particular those of isaac watts, which were very popular. before the blues gained its formal definition in terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of spirituals. it was the low-down music played by rural blacks.
depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less considered a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. however, when rural black music began to be recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.
the american sheet music publishing industry produced a great deal of ragtime music. by 1912, the sheet music industry had published three popular blues-like compositions, precipitating the tin pan alley adoption of blues elements: "baby seals' blues", by "baby" franklin seals (arranged by artie matthews); "dallas blues", by hart wand; and "the memphis blues", by w.c. handy.
handy was a formally trained musician, composer and arranger who helped to popularize the blues by transcribing and orchestrating blues in an almost symphonic style, with bands and singers. he became a popular and prolific composer, and billed himself as the "father of the blues"; however, his compositions can be described as a fusion of blues with ragtime and jazz, a merger facilitated using the cuban habanera rhythm that had long been a part of ragtime; handy's signature work was the "saint louis blues".
in the 1920s, the blues became a major element of african american and american popular music, reaching white audiences via handy's arrangements and the classic female blues performers. the blues evolved from informal performances in bars to entertainment in theaters. blues performances were organized by the theater owners bookers association in nightclubs such as the cotton club and juke joints such as the bars along beale street in memphis. several record companies, such as the american record corporation, okeh records, and paramount records, began to record african-american music.
as the recording industry grew, country blues performers like bo carter, jimmie rodgers (country singer), blind lemon jefferson, lonnie johnson, tampa red and blind blake became more popular in the african american community. kentucky-born sylvester weaver was in 1923 the first to record the slide guitar style, in which a guitar is fretted with a knife blade or the sawed-off neck of a bottle. the slide guitar became an important part of the delta blues. the first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized as a traditional, rural country blues and a more polished city or urban blues.
country blues performers often improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo or guitar. regional styles of country blues varied widely in the early 20th century. the (mississippi) delta blues was a rootsy sparse style with passionate vocals accompanied by slide guitar. the little-recorded robert johnson combined elements of urban and rural blues. in addition to robert johnson, influential performers of this style included his predecessors charley patton and son house. singers such as blind willie mctell and blind boy fuller performed in the southeastern "delicate and lyrical" piedmont blues tradition, which used an elaborate ragtime-based fingerpicking guitar technique. georgia also had an early slide tradition, with curley weaver, tampa red, "barbecue bob" hicks and james "kokomo" arnold as representatives of this style.
the lively memphis blues style, which developed in the 1920s and 1930s near memphis, tennessee, was influenced by jug bands such as the memphis jug band or the gus cannon's jug stompers. performers such as frank stokes, sleepy john estes, robert wilkins, joe mccoy, casey bill weldon and memphis minnie used a variety of unusual instruments such as washboard, fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. memphis minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. pianist memphis slim began his career in memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. many blues musicians based in memphis moved to chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement.
city or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic. classic female urban and vaudeville blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them "the big three"—gertrude "ma" rainey, bessie smith, and lucille bogan—and victoria spivey. mamie smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first african american to record a blues song in 1920; her second record, "crazy blues", sold 75,000 copies in its first month. ma rainey, the "mother of blues", and bessie smith each "[sang] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room". smith would "sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry in bending and stretching notes with her beautiful, powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed".
in 1920 the vaudeville singer lucille hegamin became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "the jazz me blues". these recordings were typically labeled "race records" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well. these blueswomen's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. the blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, broadway musicals, torch songs of the 1930s and 1940s, gospel, rhythm and blues, and eventually rock and roll."
urban male performers included popular black musicians of the era, such as tampa red, big bill broonzy and leroy carr. an important label of this era was the chicago-based bluebird records. before world war ii, tampa red was sometimes referred to as "the guitar wizard". carr accompanied himself on the piano with scrapper blackwell on guitar, a format that continued well into the 1950s with artists such as charles brown and even nat "king" cole.
boogie-woogie was another important style of 1930s and early 1940s urban blues. while the style is often associated with solo piano, boogie-woogie was also used to accompany singers and, as a solo part, in bands and small combos. boogie-woogie style was characterized by a regular bass figure, an ostinato or riff and shifts of level in the left hand, elaborating each chord and trills and decorations in the right hand. boogie-woogie was pioneered by the chicago-based jimmy yancey and the boogie-woogie trio (albert ammons, pete johnson and meade lux lewis). chicago boogie-woogie performers included clarence "pine top" smith and earl hines, who "linked the propulsive left-hand rhythms of the ragtime pianists with melodic figures similar to those of armstrong's trumpet in the right hand". the smooth louisiana style of professor longhair and, more recently, dr. john blends classic rhythm and blues with blues styles.
another development in this period was big band blues. the "territory bands" operating out of kansas city, the bennie moten orchestra, jay mcshann, and the count basie orchestra were also concentrating on the blues, with 12-bar blues instrumentals such as basie's "one o'clock jump" and "jumpin' at the woodside" and boisterous "blues shouting" by jimmy rushing on songs such as "going to chicago" and "sent for you yesterday". a well-known big band blues tune is glenn miller's "in the mood". in the 1940s, the jump blues style developed. jump blues grew up from the boogie woogie wave and was strongly influenced by big band music. it uses saxophone or other brass instruments and the guitar in the rhythm section to create a jazzy, up-tempo sound with declamatory vocals. jump blues tunes by louis jordan and big joe turner, based in kansas city, missouri, influenced the development of later styles such as rock and roll and rhythm and blues. dallas-born t-bone walker, who is often associated with the california blues style, performed a successful transition from the early urban blues à la lonnie johnson and leroy carr to the jump blues style and dominated the blues-jazz scene at los angeles during the 1940s.
the transition from country blues to urban blues that began in the 1920s was driven by the successive waves of economic crisis and booms which led many rural blacks to move to urban areas, in a movement known as the great migration. the long boom following world war ii induced another massive migration of the african-american population, the second great migration, which was accompanied by a significant increase of the real income of the urban blacks. the new migrants constituted a new market for the music industry. the term "race record", initially used by the music industry for african-american music, was replaced by the term "rhythm and blues". this rapidly evolving market was mirrored by "billboard" magazine's rhythm and blues chart. this marketing strategy reinforced trends in urban blues music such as the use of electric instruments and amplification and the generalization of the blues beat, the blues shuffle, which became ubiquitous in r&b. this commercial stream had important consequences for blues music, which, together with jazz and gospel music, became a component of r&b.
after world war ii, new styles of electric blues became popular in cities such as chicago, memphis, detroit and st. louis. electric blues used electric guitars, double bass (gradually replaced by bass guitar), drums, and harmonica (or "blues harp") played through a microphone and a pa system or an overdriven guitar amplifier. chicago became a center for electric blues from 1948 on, when muddy waters recorded his first success, "i can't be satisfied". chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by delta blues, because many performers had migrated from the mississippi region.
howlin' wolf, muddy waters, willie dixon and jimmy reed were all born in mississippi and moved to chicago during the great migration. their style is characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes slide guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums. the saxophonist j. t. brown played in bands led by elmore james and by j. b. lenoir, but the saxophone was used as a backing instrument for rhythmic support more than as a lead instrument.
little walter, sonny boy williamson (rice miller) and sonny terry are well known harmonica (called "harp" by blues musicians) players of the early chicago blues scene. other harp players such as big walter horton were also influential. muddy waters and elmore james were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. howlin' wolf and muddy waters were known for their deep, "gravelly" voices.
the bassist and prolific songwriter and composer willie dixon played a major role on the chicago blues scene. he composed and wrote many standard blues songs of the period, such as "hoochie coochie man", "i just want to make love to you" (both penned for muddy waters) and, "wang dang doodle" and "back door man" for howlin' wolf. most artists of the chicago blues style recorded for the chicago-based chess records and checker records labels. smaller blues labels of this era included vee-jay records and j.o.b. records. during the early 1950s, the dominating chicago labels were challenged by sam phillips' sun records company in memphis, which recorded b. b. king and howlin' wolf before he moved to chicago in 1960. after phillips discovered elvis presley in 1954, the sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock 'n' roll.
in the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream american popular music. while popular musicians like bo diddley and chuck berry, both recording for chess, were influenced by the chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues. chicago blues also influenced louisiana's zydeco music, with clifton chenier using blues accents. zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and cajun arrangements of blues standards.
in england, electric blues took root there during a much acclaimed muddy waters tour. waters, unsuspecting of his audience's tendency towards skiffle, an acoustic, softer brand of blues, turned up his amp and started to play his chicago brand of electric blues. although the audience was largely jolted by the performance, the performance influenced local musicians such as alexis korner and cyril davies to emulate this louder style, inspiring the british invasion of the rolling stones and the yardbirds.
in the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on chicago's west side pioneered by magic sam, buddy guy and otis rush on cobra records. the "west side sound" had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as perfected by guy, freddie king, magic slim and luther allison was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. expressive guitar solos were a key feature of this music.
other blues artists, such as john lee hooker had influences not directly related to the chicago style. john lee hooker's blues is more "personal", based on hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. though not directly influenced by boogie woogie, his "groovy" style is sometimes called "guitar boogie". his first hit, "boogie chillen", reached number 1 on the r&b charts in 1949.
by the late 1950s, the swamp blues genre developed near baton rouge, with performers such as lightnin' slim, slim harpo, sam myers and jerry mccain around the producer j. d. "jay" miller and the excello label. strongly influenced by jimmy reed, swamp blues has a slower pace and a simpler use of the harmonica than the chicago blues style performers such as little walter or muddy waters. songs from this genre include "scratch my back", "she's tough" and "i'm a king bee". alan lomax's recordings of mississippi fred mcdowell would eventually bring him wider attention on both the blues and folk circuit, with mcdowell's droning style influencing north mississippi hill country blues musicians.
by the beginning of the 1960s, genres influenced by african american music such as rock and roll and soul were part of mainstream popular music. white performers such as the beatles had brought african-american music to new audiences, both within the u.s. and abroad. however, the blues wave that brought artists such as muddy waters to the foreground had stopped. bluesmen such as big bill broonzy and willie dixon started looking for new markets in europe. dick waterman and the blues festivals he organized in europe played a major role in propagating blues music abroad. in the uk, bands emulated u.s. blues legends, and uk blues rock-based bands had an influential role throughout the 1960s.
blues performers such as john lee hooker and muddy waters continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional blues, such as new york–born taj mahal. john lee hooker blended his blues style with rock elements and playing with younger white musicians, creating a musical style that can be heard on the 1971 album "endless boogie". b. b. king's singing and virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues". king introduced a sophisticated style of guitar soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that influenced many later electric blues guitarists.
in contrast to the chicago style, king's band used strong brass support from a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone, instead of using slide guitar or harp. tennessee-born bobby "blue" bland, like b. b. king, also straddled the blues and r&b genres. during this period, freddie king and albert king often played with rock and soul musicians (eric clapton and booker t & the mgs) and had a major influence on those styles of music.
the music of the civil rights movement and free speech movement in the u.s. prompted a resurgence of interest in american roots music and early african american music. as well festivals such as the newport folk festival brought traditional blues to a new audience, which helped to revive interest in prewar acoustic blues and performers such as son house, mississippi john hurt, skip james, and reverend gary davis. many compilations of classic prewar blues were republished by the yazoo records. j. b. lenoir from the chicago blues movement in the 1950s recorded several lps using acoustic guitar, sometimes accompanied by willie dixon on the acoustic bass or drums. his songs, originally distributed only in europe, commented on political issues such as racism or vietnam war issues, which was unusual for this period. his album "alabama blues" contained a song with the following lyric:
<poem>i never will go back to alabama, that is not the place for me (2x)
you know they killed my sister and my brother,
and the whole world let them peoples go down there free</poem>
white audiences' interest in the blues during the 1960s increased due to the chicago-based paul butterfield blues band featuring guitarist michael bloomfield, and the british blues movement. the style of british blues developed in the uk, when bands such as the animals, fleetwood mac, john mayall & the bluesbreakers, the rolling stones, the yardbirds, the supergroup cream and the irish musician rory gallagher performed classic blues songs from the delta or chicago blues traditions.
in 1963, leroi jones, later known as amiri baraka, was the first to write a book on the social history of the blues in blues people: the negro music in white america.
in 1970 the trio manal established in argentina the basics of blues sung in castilian. influenced poetically by the tango and generate beatnik, and musically by the blues, rock, jazz and african music of river plate, the trio composed of alejandro medina, javier martinez and claudio gabis created a music that fused the roots of a genre born in the mississippi delta with elements of idiosyncrasy and local geography porteña. the lyrics of manal emphasize existentialism, the industrial city and the railroads, is notable in one of his most well-known songs, "avellaneda blues":
vía muerta, calle con asfalto siempre destrozado.
tren de carga, el humo y el hollín, están por todos lados.
sur y aceite, barriles en el barro, galpón abandonado.
charco sucio, el agua va pudriendo, un zapato olvidado.
dead rail, street with asphalt always shattered.
freight train, smoke and soot, are everywhere.
south and oil, barrels in the mud, abandoned shed.

"avellaneda blues" by manal (1970).
the british and blues musicians of the early 1960s inspired a number of american blues rock fusion performers, including the doors, canned heat, the early jefferson airplane, janis joplin, johnny winter, the j. geils band, ry cooder, and the allman brothers band. one blues rock performer, jimi hendrix, was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played psychedelic rock. hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of distortion and audio feedback in his music. through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of rock music.
santana, which was originally called the "carlos santana blues band", also experimented with latin-influenced blues and blues rock music around this time. at the end of the 1950s appeared the bluesy tulsa sound merging rock'n'roll, jazz and country influences. this particular music style was popularized in the 1970s by j. j. cale and the cover versions performed by eric clapton of "after midnight" and "cocaine".
in the early 1970s, the texas rock-blues style emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. in contrast with the west side blues, the texas style is strongly influenced by the british rock-blues movement. major artists of the texas style are johnny winter, stevie ray vaughan, the fabulous thunderbirds (led by harmonica player and singer-songwriter kim wilson), and zz top. these artists all began their musical careers in the 1970s but they did not achieve international success until the next decade.
since the 1980s there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues among a certain part of the african-american population, particularly around jackson, mississippi and other deep south regions. often termed "soul blues" or "southern soul", the music at the heart of this movement was given new life by the unexpected success of two particular recordings on the jackson-based malaco label: z. z. hill's "down home blues" (1982) and little milton's "the blues is alright" (1984). contemporary african-american performers who work in this style of the blues include bobby rush, denise lasalle, sir charles jones, bettye lavette, marvin sease, peggy scott-adams, mel waiters, clarence carter, dr. "feelgood" potts, o.b. buchana, ms. jody, shirley brown, and dozens of others.
during the 1980s blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. in 1986 the album "strong persuader" announced robert cray as a major blues artist. the first stevie ray vaughan recording "texas flood" was released in 1983, and the texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage. john lee hooker's popularity was revived with the album "the healer" in 1989. eric clapton, known for his performances with the blues breakers and cream, made a comeback in the 1990s with his album "unplugged", in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.
however, beginning in the 1990s, digital multitrack recording and other technological advances and new marketing strategies including video clip production increased costs, challenging the spontaneity and improvisation that are an important component of blues music.
in the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as "living blues" and "blues revue" were launched, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, and more nightclubs and venues for blues emerged.
in the 1990s, the largely ignored hill country blues gained minor recognition in both blues and alternative rock music circles with northern mississippi artists r. l. burnside and junior kimbrough. blues performers explored a range of musical genres, as can be seen, for example, from the broad array of nominees of the yearly blues music awards, previously named w.c. handy awards or of the grammy awards for best contemporary and traditional blues album. the billboard blues album chart provides an overview of current blues hits. contemporary blues music is nurtured by several blues labels such as: alligator records, ruf records, severn records, chess records (mca), delmark records, northernblues music, fat possum records and vanguard records (artemis records). some labels are famous for rediscovering and remastering blues rarities, including arhoolie records, smithsonian folkways recordings (heir of folkways records), and yazoo records (shanachie records).
from the late 2000s to the present day, blues rock has gained a cultural following, especially after the rise of the internet, when artists started creating youtube channels, forums, and facebook pages. notable blues rock musicians of this period include joe bonamassa, gary clark jr., john mayer, shemekia copeland, eric gales, kenny wayne shepherd, walter trout, beth hart, warren haynes, jason ricci, susan tedeschi, derek trucks, ben harper (in collaboration with charlie musselwhite) and orianthi. alternative rock artists still combine strong elements of blues in their music, especially zz ward, cage the elephant, jack white, and the black keys.
blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music. prominent jazz, folk or rock performers, such as louis armstrong, duke ellington, miles davis, and bob dylan have performed significant blues recordings. the blues scale is often used in popular songs like harold arlen's "blues in the night", blues ballads like "since i fell for you" and "please send me someone to love", and even in orchestral works such as george gershwin's "rhapsody in blue" and "concerto in f". gershwin's second "prelude" for solo piano is an interesting example of a classical blues, maintaining the form with academic strictness. the blues scale is ubiquitous in modern popular music and informs many modal frames, especially the ladder of thirds used in rock music (for example, in "a hard day's night"). blues forms are used in the theme to the televised "batman", teen idol fabian forte's hit, "turn me loose", country music star jimmie rodgers' music, and guitarist/vocalist tracy chapman's hit "give me one reason".
early country bluesmen such as skip james, charley patton, georgia tom dorsey played country and urban blues and had influences from spiritual singing. dorsey helped to popularize gospel music. gospel music developed in the 1930s, with the golden gate quartet. in the 1950s, soul music by sam cooke, ray charles and james brown used gospel and blues music elements. in the 1960s and 1970s, gospel and blues were merged in soul blues music. funk music of the 1970s was influenced by soul; funk can be seen as an antecedent of hip-hop and contemporary r&b.
r&b music can be traced back to spirituals and blues. musically, spirituals were a descendant of new england choral traditions, and in particular of isaac watts's hymns, mixed with african rhythms and call-and-response forms. spirituals or religious chants in the african-american community are much better documented than the "low-down" blues. spiritual singing developed because african-american communities could gather for mass or worship gatherings, which were called camp meetings.
edward p. comentale has noted how the blues was often used as a medium for art or self-expression, stating: "as heard from delta shacks to chicago tenements to harlem cabarets, the blues proved—despite its pained origins—a remarkably flexible medium and a new arena for the shaping of identity and community."
before world war ii, the boundaries between blues and jazz were less clear. usually jazz had harmonic structures stemming from brass bands, whereas blues had blues forms such as the 12-bar blues. however, the jump blues of the 1940s mixed both styles. after wwii, blues had a substantial influence on jazz. bebop classics, such as charlie parker's "now's the time", used the blues form with the pentatonic scale and blue notes.
bebop marked a major shift in the role of jazz, from a popular style of music for dancing, to a "high-art", less-accessible, cerebral "musician's music". the audience for both blues and jazz split, and the border between blues and jazz became more defined.
the blues' 12-bar structure and the blues scale was a major influence on rock and roll music. rock and roll has been called "blues with a backbeat"; carl perkins called rockabilly "blues with a country beat". rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a bluegrass beat. "hound dog", with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on flatted third of the tonic (and flatted seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. jerry lee lewis's style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie woogie. his style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several african american rock and roll performers).
many early rock and roll songs are based on blues: "that's all right mama", "johnny b. goode", "blue suede shoes", "whole lotta shakin' goin on", "shake, rattle, and roll", and "long tall sally". the early african american rock musicians retained the sexual themes and innuendos of blues music: "got a gal named sue, knows just what to do" ("tutti frutti", little richard) or "see the girl with the red dress on, she can do the birdland all night long" ("what'd i say", ray charles). the 12-bar blues structure can be found even in novelty pop songs, such as bob dylan's "obviously five believers" and esther and abi ofarim's "cinderella rockefella".
early country music was infused with the blues. jimmie rodgers, moon mullican, bob wills, bill monroe and hank williams have all described themselves as blues singers and their music has a blues feel that is different, at first glance at least, from the later country pop of artists like eddy arnold. yet, if one looks back further, arnold also started out singing bluesy songs like 'i'll hold you in my heart'. a lot of the 1970s-era "outlaw" country music by willie nelson and waylon jennings also borrowed from the blues. when jerry lee lewis returned to country after the decline of 1950s style rock and roll, he sang his country with a blues feel and often included blues standards on his albums.
like jazz, rock and roll, heavy metal music, hip hop music, reggae, rap, country music, and pop music, blues has been accused of being the "devil's music" and of inciting violence and other poor behavior. in the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s. in the early twentieth century, w.c. handy was the first to popularize blues-influenced music among non-black americans.
during the blues revival of the 1960s and '70s, acoustic blues artist taj mahal and legendary texas bluesman lightnin' hopkins wrote and performed music that figured prominently in the popularly and critically acclaimed film "sounder" (1972). the film earned mahal a grammy nomination for best original score written for a motion picture and a bafta nomination. almost 30 years later, mahal wrote blues for, and performed a banjo composition, claw-hammer style, in the 2001 movie release "songcatcher", which focused on the story of the preservation of the roots music of appalachia.
perhaps the most visible example of the blues style of music in the late 20th century came in 1980, when dan aykroyd and john belushi released the film "the blues brothers". the film drew many of the biggest living influencers of the rhythm and blues genre together, such as ray charles, james brown, cab calloway, aretha franklin, and john lee hooker. the band formed also began a successful tour under the blues brothers marquee. 1998 brought a sequel, "blues brothers 2000" that, while not holding as great a critical and financial success, featured a much larger number of blues artists, such as b.b. king, bo diddley, erykah badu, eric clapton, steve winwood, charlie musselwhite, blues traveler, jimmie vaughan, and jeff baxter.
in 2003, martin scorsese made significant efforts to promote the blues to a larger audience. he asked several famous directors such as clint eastwood and wim wenders to participate in a series of documentary films for pbs called "the blues". he also participated in the rendition of compilations of major blues artists in a series of high-quality cds. blues guitarist and vocalist keb' mo' performed his blues rendition of "america, the beautiful" in 2006 to close out the final season of the television series "the west wing".
the blues was highlighted in season 2012, episode 1 of "in performance at the white house", entitled "red, white and blues". hosted by president obama and mrs. obama, the show featured performances by b.b. king, buddy guy, gary clark jr., jeff beck, derek trucks, keb mo, and others.

cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a futuristic setting that tends to focus on a "combination of lowlife and high tech" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.
much of cyberpunk is rooted in the new wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like philip k. dick, roger zelazny, john brunner, j. g. ballard, philip josé farmer and harlan ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. released in 1984, william gibson's influential debut novel "neuromancer" would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. other influential cyberpunk writers included bruce sterling and rudy rucker. the japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of katsuhiro otomo's manga series "akira", with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre.
early films in the genre include ridley scott's 1982 film "blade runner", one of several of philip k. dick's works that have been adapted into films. the films "johnny mnemonic" (1995) and "new rose hotel" (1998), both based upon short stories by william gibson, flopped commercially and critically. "the matrix trilogy" (1999-2003) were some of the most successful cyberpunk films. more recent additions to this genre of filmmaking include "blade runner 2049" (2017), sequel to the original 1982 film, as well as "upgrade" (2018), "" (2019) based on the 1990s japanese manga "battle angel alita", and the 2018 netflix tv series "altered carbon".
lawrence person has attempted to define the content and ethos of the cyberpunk literary movement stating:
cyberpunk plots often center on conflict among artificial intelligences, hackers, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future earth, rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as isaac asimov's "foundation" or frank herbert's "dune". the settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors ("the street finds its own uses for things"). much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction. there are sources who view that cyberpunk has shifted from a literary movement to a mode of science fiction due to the limited number of writers and its transition to a more generalized cultural formation.
the origins of cyberpunk are rooted in the new wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 70s, where "new worlds", under the editorship of michael moorcock, began inviting and encouraging stories that examined new writing styles, techniques, and archetypes. reacting to conventional storytelling, new wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. writers like roger zelazny, j.g. ballard, philip jose farmer, and harlan ellison often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the beat generation (especially william s. burroughs' own sf), dadaism, and their own ideas. ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the "archetypes" popular since the time of ancient greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as joseph campbell argued in "the hero with a thousand faces". instead, ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with "more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics."
this had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement "cyberpunk". one, bruce sterling, later said:
ballard, zelazny, and the rest of new wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more "realism" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.
similarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the philip k. dick novel "do androids dream of electric sheep", first published in 1968. presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as gibson and sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more "realist" than the isaac asimov "robot" series that laid its philosophical foundation. this novel was made into the seminal movie "blade runner", released in 1982. this was one year after another story, "johnny mnemonic" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. this story, which also became a film years later, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.
in 1983 a short story written by bruce bethke, called "cyberpunk", was published in "amazing stories". the term was picked up by gardner dozois, editor of "isaac asimov's science fiction magazine" and popularized in his editorials. bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.
he described the idea thus:
afterward, dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a "washington post" article where he said "about the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic “school” would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as “cyberpunks” — sterling, gibson, shiner, cadigan, bear."
about that time, william gibson's novel "neuromancer" was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk "virtual reality", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. some, perhaps ironically including bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style gibson's books epitomized should be called "neuromantics", a pun on the name of the novel plus "new romantics", a term used for a new wave pop music movement that had just occurred in britain, but this term did not catch on. bethke later paraphrased michael swanwick's argument for the term: "the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly imitation "neuromancer"".
sterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula. in 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called "", an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from sterling's perspective.
in the subsequent decade, the motifs of gibson's "neuromancer" became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of neal stephenson's "snow crash" in 1992.
bookending the cyberpunk era, bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called "headcrash", like "snow crash" a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the philip k. dick award.
it satirized the genre in this way:
the impact of cyberpunk, though, has been long-lasting. elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously steampunk, but also a host of other cyberpunk derivatives.
primary figures in the cyberpunk movement include william gibson, neal stephenson, bruce sterling, bruce bethke, pat cadigan, rudy rucker, and john shirley. philip k. dick (author of "do androids dream of electric sheep?", from which the film "blade runner" was adapted) is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement.
"blade runner" can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme. video games, board games, and tabletop role-playing games, such as "cyberpunk 2020" and "shadowrun", often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. cyberpunk is also featured prominently in anime and manga (japanese cyberpunk), with "akira", "ghost in the shell" and "cowboy bebop" being among the most notable.
cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from hardboiled detective fiction, film noir, and postmodernist prose to describe an often nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. the genre's vision of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally utopian visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. gibson defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian sf in his 1981 short story "the gernsback continuum," which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.
in some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality. a typical trope in such work is a direct connection between the human brain and computer systems. cyberpunk settings are dystopias with corruption, computers and internet connectivity. giant, multinational corporations have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power.
the economic and technological state of japan is a regular theme in the cyberpunk literature of the '80s. of japan's influence on the genre, william gibson said, "modern japan simply was cyberpunk." cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and "city lights, receding" was used by gibson as one of the genre's first metaphors for cyberspace and virtual reality. the cityscapes of hong kong and shanghai have had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as "blade runner" and "shadowrun". ridley scott envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk los angeles in "blade runner" to be "hong kong on a very bad day". the streetscapes of "ghost in the shell" were based on hong kong. its director mamoru oshii felt that hong kong's strange and chaotic streets where "old and new exist in confusing relationships", fit the theme of the film well. hong kong's kowloon walled city is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes.
one of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is case, from gibson's "neuromancer". case is a "console cowboy," a brilliant hacker who has betrayed his organized criminal partners. robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.
like case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. these anti-heroes—"criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits"—call to mind the private eye of detective fiction. this emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the "punk" component of cyberpunk.
cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. it often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of cultural revolution in science fiction. in the words of author and critic david brin:
...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...popular science fiction tales by gibson, williams, cadigan and others "do" depict orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite.
cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the internet. the earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the world wide web entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as arthur c. clarke and some social commentators such as james burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form.
some observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and africans. for instance, it is claimed that cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower masculinity using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws. critics also note the absence of any reference to africa or an african-american character in the quintessential cyberpunk film "blade runner" while other films reinforce stereotypes.
minnesota writer bruce bethke coined the term in 1980 for his short story "cyberpunk," which was published in the november 1983 issue of "amazing science fiction stories". the term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of william gibson, bruce sterling, pat cadigan and others. of these, sterling became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine "cheap truth." john shirley wrote articles on sterling and rucker's significance. john brunner's 1975 novel "the shockwave rider" is considered by many to be the first cyberpunk novel with many of the tropes commonly associated with the genre, some five years before the term was popularized by dozois.
william gibson with his novel "neuromancer" (1984) is arguably the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. he emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction tropes. regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as "the archetypal cyberpunk work," "neuromancer" was awarded the hugo, nebula, and philip k. dick awards. "count zero" (1986) and "mona lisa overdrive" (1988) followed after gibson's popular debut novel. according to the jargon file, "gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating."
early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. shortly thereafter, however, some critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. these critics said that the sf new wave of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. furthermore, while "neuromancer"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s narrator may have had an unusual "voice" for science fiction, much older examples can be found: gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated raymond chandler, as in his novel "the big sleep" (1939). others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing j. g. ballard, philip k. dick, harlan ellison, stanisław lem, samuel r. delany, and even william s. burroughs. for example, philip k. dick's works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities. the influential cyberpunk movie "blade runner" (1982) is based on his book, "do androids dream of electric sheep?". humans linked to machines are found in pohl and kornbluth's "wolfbane" (1959) and roger zelazny's "creatures of light and darkness" (1968).
in 1994, scholar brian stonehill suggested that thomas pynchon's 1973 novel "gravity's rainbow" "not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace." other important predecessors include alfred bester's two most celebrated novels, "the demolished man" and "the stars my destination", as well as vernor vinge's novella "true names".
science-fiction writer david brin describes cyberpunk as "the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction." it may not have attracted the "real punks," but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to hollywood and to the visual arts generally. although the "self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution" on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, brin declares that the "rebels did shake things up. we owe them a debt."
fredric jameson considers cyberpunk the "supreme literary expression if not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself".
cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the "original" cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as george alec effinger's "when gravity fails". "wired" magazine, created by louis rossetto and jane metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today's cyberpunk fans, which paula yoo claims "proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world."
the film "blade runner" (1982)—adapted from philip k. dick's "do androids dream of electric sheep?"—is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on earth to various bounty hunters who "retire" (kill) them. although "blade runner" was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a cult film. since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of dick's original novel (e.g. empathy boxes and wilbur mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. william gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for "neuromancer", a book he was then working on. the film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as "the matrix trilogy" (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.
the number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since "blade runner". several of philip k. dick's works have been adapted to the silver screen. the films "johnny mnemonic" and "new rose hotel", both based upon short stories by william gibson, flopped commercially and critically. these box offices misses significantly slowed the development of cyberpunk as a literary or cultural form although a sequel to the 1982 film "blade runner" was released in october 2017 with harrison ford reprising his role from the original film.
in addition, "tech-noir" film as a hybrid genre, means a work of combining neo-noir and science fiction or cyberpunk. it includes many cyberpunk films such as "blade runner", "burst city", "robocop", "12 monkeys", "the lawnmower man", "hackers", "hardware", and "strange days."
the japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of katsuhiro otomo's manga series "akira", with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre. "akira" inspired a wave of japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as "ghost in the shell", "battle angel alita", "cowboy bebop", and "serial experiments lain". other early japanese cyberpunk works include the 1982 film "burst city", the 1985 original video animation "megazone 23", and the 1989 film "".
cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. in japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. william gibson's "neuromancer," whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in chiba, one of japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel gibson did not know the location of chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. the exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the japanese culture.
cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside japan. "the conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. it is a culture that does not exist right now, so the japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a western one, especially as western cyberpunk often incorporates many japanese elements." william gibson is now a frequent visitor to japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of japan have become a reality:
modern japan simply was cyberpunk. the japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. i remember my first glimpse of shibuya, when one of the young tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, "you see? you see? it is "blade runner" town." and it was. it so evidently was.
cyberpunk themes have appeared in many anime and manga, including the ground-breaking "appleseed", "ghost in the shell", "ergo proxy", "megazone 23", "neo tokyo", "goku midnight eye", "cyber city oedo 808", "bubblegum crisis", "", "angel cop", "extra", "blame!", "armitage iii", "texhnolyze", "neon genesis evangelion" and "psycho-pass".
"akira" (1982 manga) and its 1988 anime film adaptation have influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. "akira" has been cited as a major influence on hollywood films such as "the matrix", "chronicle", "looper", "midnight special", and "inception", as well as cyberpunk-influenced video games such as hideo kojima's "snatcher" and "metal gear solid", valve's "half-life" series and dontnod entertainment's "remember me". "akira" has also influenced the work of musicians such as kanye west, who paid homage to "akira" in the "stronger" music video, and lupe fiasco, whose album "tetsuo & youth" is named after tetsuo shima. the popular bike from the film, kaneda's motorbike, appears in "steven spielberg"'s film "ready player one", and cd projekt's video game "cyberpunk 2077".
"ghost in the shell" (1989) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers. its 1995 anime film adaptation inspired the wachowskis to create "the matrix" (1999) and its sequels. "the matrix" series took several concepts from the film, including the matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of "ghost in the shell", and the way characters access the matrix through holes in the back of their necks. other parallels have been drawn to james cameron's "avatar", steven spielberg's "a.i. artificial intelligence", and jonathan mostow's "surrogates".
the original video animation "megazone 23" (1985) has a number of similarities to "the matrix". "battle angel alita" (1990) has had a notable influence on filmmaker james cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since 2000. it was an influence on his tv series "dark angel", and he is the producer of the 2018 film adaptation "".
there are cyberpunk video games. popular series include the "megami tensei" series, "metal gear" series, "final fantasy vii" and its spin-offs, "deus ex" series, "syndicate" series, and "system shock" and its sequel. other games, like "blade runner", "ghost in the shell", and the "matrix" series, are based upon genre movies, or role-playing games (for instance the various "shadowrun" games).
several rpgs called "cyberpunk" exist: "cyberpunk", "cyberpunk 2020" and "cyberpunk v3", by r. talsorian games, and "gurps cyberpunk", published by steve jackson games as a module of the gurps family of rpgs. "cyberpunk 2020" was designed with the settings of william gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval, unlike the approach taken by fasa in producing the transgenre "shadowrun" game. both are set in the near future, in a world where cybernetics are prominent. in addition, iron crown enterprises released an rpg named "cyberspace", which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online pdf form. cd projekt red is currently developing "cyberpunk 2077," a cyberpunk first-person open world rpg video-game based on the tabletop rpg "cyberpunk 2020".
in 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the united states secret service raided steve jackson games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. officials denied that the target had been the "gurps cyberpunk" sourcebook, but jackson would later write that he and his colleagues "were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] the secret service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said "tomorrow" every day from march 4 to march 26. on march 26 we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless." steve jackson games won a lawsuit against the secret service, aided by the new electronic frontier foundation. this event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. all published editions of "gurps cyberpunk" have a tagline on the front cover, which reads "the book that was seized by the u.s. secret service!" inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.
cyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board games such as "necromunda" by games workshop. "netrunner" is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the "cyberpunk 2020" role-playing game. "tokyo nova", debuting in 1993, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses playing cards instead of dice.
some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include psydoll, front line assembly, clock dva and sigue sigue sputnik. some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. albums such as gary numan's "replicas", "the pleasure principle" and "telekon" were heavily inspired by the works of philip k. dick. kraftwerk's "the man-machine" and "computer world" albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. nine inch nails' concept album "year zero" also fits into this category. fear factory concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. billy idol's "cyberpunk" drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. "1. outside", a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by david bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including sonic youth, whose albums "sister" and "daydream nation" take influence from the works of philip k. dick and william gibson respectively.
vaporwave and synthwave are also influenced by cyberpunk. the former has been interpreted as a dystopian critique of capitalism in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter as a nostalgic retrofuturistic revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins.
some neo-futurism artworks and cityscapes have been influenced by cyberpunk, such as the sony center in the potsdamer platz public square of berlin, germany.
several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. these include the cyberdelic counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as "cyberpunks", attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the technology of cyberculture. early adherents included timothy leary, mark frauenfelder and r. u. sirius. the movement largely faded following the dot-com bubble implosion of 2000.
cybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and gothic subcultures. in addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth, and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, "post apocalypse", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. this fashion goes by names like "tech wear", "goth ninja" or "tech ninja". important designers in this type of fashion are acronym, demobaza, boris bidjan saberi, rick owens and alexander wang.
the kowloon walled city in hong kong (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.
as a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. these focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. one prominent subgenre is "steampunk," which is set in an alternate history victorian era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak film noir world view. the term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of tim powers, james p. blaylock, and k.w. jeter, but by the time gibson and sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel "the difference engine" the term was being used earnestly as well.
another subgenre is "biopunk" (cyberpunk themes dominated by biotechnology) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. in these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic manipulation. paul di filippo is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious ribofunk. bruce sterling's shaper/mechanist cycle is also seen as a major influence. in addition, some people consider works such as neal stephenson's "the diamond age" to be postcyberpunk.
cyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within postmodern literature.
role playing game publisher r. talsorian games, owner of the "cyberpunk 2020" franchise, trademarked the word "cyberpunk" in the united states in 2012. video game developer cd projekt, which is developing "cyberpunk 2077", bought the u.s. trademark from r. talsorian games, and has filed a trademark in the european union.

a comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. with the development of the internet, they began to appear online as webcomics. there were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in south korea alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.
strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist. as the name implies, comic strips can be humorous (for example, "gag-a-day" strips such as "blondie", "bringing up father", "marmaduke", and "pearls before swine").
starting in the late 1920s, comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories, as seen in "popeye", "captain easy", "buck rogers", "tarzan", and "the adventures of tintin". soap-opera continuity strips such as "judge parker" and "mary worth" gained popularity in the 1940s. all are called, generically, comic strips, though cartoonist will eisner has suggested that "sequential art" would be a better genre-neutral name.
in the uk and the rest of europe, comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines, with a strip's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more. comic strips have appeared in american magazines such as "liberty" and "boys' life" and also on the front covers of magazines, such as the "flossy frills" series on "the american weekly" sunday newspaper supplement.
storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history. one medieval european example in textile form is the bayeux tapestry. printed examples emerged in 19th-century germany and in 18th-century england, where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced. william hogarth's 18th century english cartoons include both narrative sequences, such as "a rake's progress", and single panels.
the "biblia pauperum" ("paupers' bible"), a tradition of picture bibles beginning in the later middle ages, sometimes depicted biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips.
in china, with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image, experiments with what became "lianhuanhua" date back to 1884.
the first newspaper comic strips appeared in north america in the late 19th century. "the yellow kid" is usually credited as one of the first newspaper strips. however, the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip.
swiss author and caricature artist rodolphe töpffer (geneva, 1799–1846) is considered the father of the modern comic strips. his illustrated stories such as "histoire de m. vieux bois" (1827), first published in the usa in 1842 as "the adventures of obadiah oldbuck" or "histoire de monsieur jabot" (1831), inspired subsequent generations of german and american comic artists. in 1865, german painter, author, and caricaturist wilhelm busch created the strip "max and moritz", about two trouble-making boys, which had a direct influence on the american comic strip. "max and moritz" was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of german children's stories such as "struwwelpeter" ("shockheaded peter"); in one, the boys, after perpetrating some mischief, are tossed into a sack of grain, run through a mill, and consumed by a flock of geese. "max and moritz" provided an inspiration for german immigrant rudolph dirks, who created the "katzenjammer kids" in 1897. familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain, sawing logs for snoring, speech balloons, and thought balloons originated in dirks' strip.
hugely popular, "katzenjammer kids" occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. when dirks left william randolph hearst for the promise of a better salary under joseph pulitzer, it was an unusual move, since cartoonists regularly deserted pulitzer for hearst. in a highly unusual court decision, hearst retained the rights to the name "katzenjammer kids", while creator dirks retained the rights to the characters. hearst promptly hired harold knerr to draw his own version of the strip. dirks renamed his version "hans and fritz" (later, "the captain and the kids"). thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades. dirks' version, eventually distributed by united feature syndicate, ran until 1979.
in the united states, the great popularity of comics sprang from the . "the little bears" (1893–96) was the first american comic strip with recurring characters, while the first color comic supplement was published by the "chicago inter-ocean" sometime in the latter half of 1892, followed by the "new york journal"'s first color sunday comic pages in 1897. on january 31, 1912, hearst introduced the nation's first full daily comic page in his "new york evening journal". the history of this newspaper rivalry and the rapid appearance of comic strips in most major american newspapers is discussed by ian gordon. numerous events in newspaper comic strips have reverberated throughout society at large, though few of these events occurred in recent years, owing mainly to the declining role of the newspaper comic strip as an entertainment form.
the longest-running american comic strips are:
most newspaper comic strips are syndicated; a syndicate hires people to write and draw a strip and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. some newspaper strips begin or remain exclusive to one newspaper. for example, the "pogo" comic strip by walt kelly originally appeared only in the "new york star" in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.
newspaper comic strips come in two different types: daily strips and sunday strips. in the united states, a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays, monday through saturday, as contrasted with a sunday strip, which typically only appears on sundays. daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and sunday strips are usually in color. however, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published sunday strips in black and white.
the popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including john updike and ray bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. often posted on bulletin boards, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. the "baltimore sun"'s linda white recalled, "i followed the adventures of "winnie winkle", "moon mullins" and "dondi", and waited each fall to see how lucy would manage to trick charlie brown into trying to kick that football. (after i left for college, my father would clip out that strip each year and send it to me just to make sure i didn’t miss it.)"
the two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels. the strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. a horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in mike peters' "mother goose and grimm".
early daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high. initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. by the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. during the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25 inches wide by six inches high. over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller, until by 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip. as strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.
proof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips (which they arranged to have colored in the case of sunday strips). michigan state university comic art collection librarian randy scott describes these as "large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers. typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one sunday strip. thus, a week of "beetle bailey" would arrive at the "lansing state journal" in two sheets, printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page." comic strip historian allan holtz described how strips were provided as mats (the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates) or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press. he also notes that with electronic means of distribution becoming more prevalent printed sheets "are definitely on their way out."
nea syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, "star hawks", but after a few years, "star hawks" dropped down to a single tier.
in flanders, the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like "spike and suzy" and "nero". they appear monday through saturday; until 2003 there were no sunday papers in flanders. in the last decades, they have switched from black and white to color.
single panels usually, but not always, are not broken up and lack continuity. the daily "peanuts" is a strip, and the daily "dennis the menace" is a single panel. j. r. williams' long-run "out our way" continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a sunday strip, "out our way with the willets". jimmy hatlo's "they'll do it every time" was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.
sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section. early sunday strips (known colloquially as "the funny papers", shortened to "the funnies"), such as "thimble theatre" and "little orphan annie", filled an entire newspaper page, a format known to collectors as full page. sunday pages during the 1930s and into the 1940s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip. no matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip, the extra strip was known as the topper, such as "the squirrel cage" which ran along with "room and board", both drawn by gene ahern.
during the 1930s, the original art for a sunday strip was usually drawn quite large. for example, in 1930, russ westover drew his "tillie the toiler" sunday page at a size of 17" × 37". in 1937, the cartoonist dudley fisher launched the innovative "right around home", drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire sunday page.
full-page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size. strips such as "the phantom" and "terry and the pirates" began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the "new orleans times picayune", or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the "chicago sun-times". when sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. during world war ii, because of paper shortages, the size of sunday strips began to shrink. after the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. the last full-page comic strip was the "prince valiant" strip for 11 april 1971.
comic strips have also been published in sunday newspaper magazines. russell patterson and carolyn wells' "new adventures of flossy frills" was a continuing strip series seen on sunday magazine covers. beginning january 26, 1941, it ran on the front covers of hearst's "american weekly" newspaper magazine supplement, continuing until march 30 of that year. between 1939 and 1943, four different stories featuring flossy appeared on "american weekly" covers.
sunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors. printing plates were created with four or more colors—traditionally, the cmyk color model: cyan, magenta, yellow and "k" for black. with a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a halftone that appears to the eye in different gradations. the semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.
the decade of the 1960s saw the rise of underground newspapers, which often carried comic strips, such as "fritz the cat" and "the fabulous furry freak brothers". "zippy the pinhead" initially appeared in underground publications in the 1970s before being syndicated. "bloom county" and "doonesbury" began as strips in college newspapers under different titles, and later moved to national syndication. underground comic strips covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips, such as sex and drugs. many underground artists, notably vaughn bode, dan o'neill, gilbert shelton, and art spiegelman went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as "playboy", "national lampoon", and pete millar's "cartoons". jay lynch graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to "mad" and children's books.
"webcomics", also known as "online comics" and "internet comics", are comics that are available to read on the internet. many are exclusively published online, but the majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some internet presence. king features syndicate and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites. some, such as scott adams, creator of "dilbert", include an email address in each strip.
most comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip's life, but in some strips, like lynn johnston's award-winning "for better or for worse", the characters age as the years pass. the first strip to feature aging characters was "gasoline alley".
the history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous, but tell an ongoing dramatic story. examples include "the phantom", "prince valiant", "dick tracy", "mary worth", "modesty blaise", "little orphan annie", "flash gordon", and "tarzan". sometimes these are spin-offs from comic books, for example "superman", "batman", and "the amazing spider-man".
a number of strips have featured animals ('funny animals') as main characters. some are non-verbal ("marmaduke", "the angriest dog in the world"), some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans, ("garfield", snoopy in "peanuts"), and some can converse with humans ("bloom county", "calvin and hobbes", "mutts", "citizen dog", "buckles", "get fuzzy", "pearls before swine", and "pooch cafe"). other strips are centered entirely on animals, as in "pogo" and "donald duck". gary larson's "the far side" was unusual, as there were no central characters. instead "the far side" used a wide variety of characters including humans, monsters, aliens, chickens, cows, worms, amoebas, and more. john mcpherson's "close to home" also uses this theme, though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real-life situations. wiley miller not only mixes human, animal, and fantasy characters, but also does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title, "non sequitur". bob thaves's "frank & ernest" began in 1972 and paved the way for some of these strips, as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms — as animals, vegetables, and minerals.
the comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society, and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary. this ranged from the conservative slant of "little orphan annie" to the unabashed liberalism of "doonesbury". "pogo" used animals to particularly devastating effect, caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of pogo's okeefenokee swamp. in a fearless move, pogo's creator walt kelly took on joseph mccarthy in the 1950s, caricaturing him as a bobcat named simple j. malarkey, a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters' birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables. kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the mccarthy era. at a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent, and subversive content, kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips. going before the congressional subcommittee, he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality. the comic strip was safe for satire.
during the early 20th century, comic strips were widely associated with publisher william randolph hearst, whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the united states. hearst was notorious for his practice of yellow journalism, and he was frowned on by readers of "the new york times" and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips. hearst's critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of george herriman's "krazy kat". an inspiration for bill watterson and other cartoonists, "krazy kat" gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s.
some comic strips, such as "doonesbury" and "the boondocks", may be printed on the editorial or op-ed page rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary. for example, the august 12, 1974 "doonesbury" strip was awarded a 1975 pulitzer prize for its depiction of the watergate scandal. "dilbert" is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip's commentary about office politics, and tank mcnamara often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter. lynn johnston's "for better or for worse" created an uproar when one of its supporting characters came out of the closet and announced he was gay.
the world's longest comic strip is long and on display at trafalgar square as part of the london comedy festival. the london cartoon strip was created by 15 of britain's best known cartoonists and depicts the history of london.
the reuben, named for cartoonist rube goldberg, is the most prestigious award for u.s. comic strip artists. reuben awards are presented annually by the national cartoonists society (ncs).
in 1995, the united states postal service issued a series of commemorative stamps, comic strip classics, marking the comic-strip centennial.
today's strip artists, with the help of the ncs, enthusiastically promote the medium, which is considered to be in decline due to fewer markets (today few strips are published in newspapers outside the united states, the united kingdom, and canada, mainly because of the smaller interest there, with translated versions of popular strips - particularly in spanish - are primarily read over the internet) and ever-shrinking newspaper space. one particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the great comic strip switcheroonie, held in 1997 on april fool's day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other's strips. "garfield"’s jim davis, for example, switched with "blondie"’s stan drake, while scott adams ("dilbert") traded strips with bil keane ("the family circus").
while the 1997 switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, an artist taking over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). in fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre's more popular strips. examples include "little orphan annie" (drawn and plotted by harold gray from 1924 to 1944 and thereafter by a succession of artists including leonard starr and andrew pepoy), and "terry and the pirates", started by milton caniff in 1934 and picked up by george wunder.
a business-driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name. in one case, in the early 1940s, don flowers' "modest maidens" was so admired by william randolph hearst that he lured flowers away from the associated press and to king features syndicate by doubling the cartoonist's salary, and renamed the feature "glamor girls" to avoid legal action by the ap. the latter continued to publish "modest maidens", drawn by jay allen in flowers' style.
as newspapers have declined, the changes have affected comic strips. jeff reece, lifestyle editor of "the florida times-union", wrote, "comics are sort of the 'third rail' of the newspaper."
in the early decades of the 20th century, all sunday comics received a full page, and daily strips were generally the width of the page. the competition between papers for having more cartoons than the rest from the mid-1920s, the growth of large-scale newspaper advertising during most of the thirties, paper rationing during world war ii, the decline on news readership (as television newscasts began to be more common) and inflation (which has caused higher printing costs) beginning during the fifties and sixties led to sunday strips being published on smaller and more diverse formats. daily strips have suffered as well, in 1910 the strips had an unlimited amount of panels, covering the entire width page, while by 1930 most "dailies" had four or five panels covering six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper, by 1958 those four panels would be narrower, and those would have half of the space a 1910 daily strip had, and by 1998 most strips would have three panels only (with a few exceptions), or even two or one on an occasional basis, apart from strips being smaller, as most papers became slightly narrower. while most cartoonist decided to follow the tide, some cartoonists have complained about this, with "pogo" ending in 1975 as a form of protest from its creators against the practice. since then "calvin and hobbes" creator bill watterson has written extensively on the issue, arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist. after a lengthy battle with his syndicator, watterson won the privilege of making half page-sized sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked. many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this, and some papers continued to print "calvin and hobbes" at small sizes. opus won that same privilege years after "calvin and hobbes" ended, while wiley miller circumvented further downsizings by making his "non sequitur" sunday strip available only in an extremely vertical (near-page-long) arrangement. few newspapers still run half-page strips, as with "prince valiant" and "hägar the horrible" in the front page of the "reading eagle" sunday comics section. actually universal uclick and united media practically have no half-page comics, with the remaining strips from both syndicates in this format are published only as "thirds", "fourths", and "sixths" (also called "third tabs").
in an issue related to size limitations, sunday comics are often bound to rigid formats that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable. such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. as a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels. "garfield" and "mutts" were known during the mid-to-late 80s and 1990s respectively for their throwaways on their sunday strips, however both strips now run "generic" title panels.
with the success of "the gumps" during the 1920s, it became commonplace for strips (comedy- and adventure-laden alike) to have lengthy stories spanning weeks or months. the "monarch of medioka" story in floyd gottfredson's "mickey mouse" comic strip ran from september 8, 1937 to may 2, 1938. between the 1960s and the late 1980s, as television news relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily, syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags, or week-long "storylines" (with six consecutive (mostly unrelated) strips following a same subject), with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure-based and dramatic strips. strips begun during the mid-1980s or after (such as "get fuzzy", "over the hedge", "monty", and others) are known for their heavy use of storylines, lasting between one and three weeks in most cases.
the writing style of comic strips changed as well after world war ii. with an increase in the number of college-educated readers, there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor. slapstick and visual gags became more confined to sunday strips, because as "garfield" creator jim davis put it, "children are more likely to read sunday strips than dailies."
many older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist, who has either died or retired. such strips are known as "zombie strips". a cartoonist, paid by the syndicate or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist, continues writing the strip, a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the 20th century. "hägar the horrible" and "frank and ernest" are both drawn by the sons of the creators. some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies, such as jim davis' "garfield", however there is some debate if these strips fall in this category.
this act is commonly criticized by modern cartoonists including watterson and "pearls before swine"'s stephan pastis. the issue was addressed in six consecutive "pearls" strips in 2005. charles schulz, of "peanuts" fame, requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death. he also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer, comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts. schulz's family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue "peanuts" with a new author.
since the consolidation of newspaper comics by the first quarter of the 20th century, most cartoonists have used a group of assistants (with usually one of them credited). however, quite a few cartoonists (e.g.: george herriman and charles schulz, among others) have done their strips almost completely by themselves; often criticizing the use of assistants for the same reasons most have about their editors hiring anyone else to continue their work after their retirement.
historically, syndicates owned the creators' work, enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired, left the strip, or died. this practice led to the term "legacy strips," or more pejoratively "zombie strips"). most syndicates signed creators to 10- or even 20-year contracts. (there have been exceptions, however, such as bud fisher's "mutt and jeff" being an early — if not the earliest — case in which the creator retained ownership of his work.) both these practices began to change with the 1970 debut of universal press syndicate, as the company gave cartoonists a 50-percent ownership share of their work. creators syndicate, founded in 1987, granted artists full rights to the strips, something that universal press did in 1990, followed by king features in 1995. by 1999 both tribune media services and united feature had begun granting ownership rights to creators (limited to new and/or hugely popular strips).
starting in the late 1940s, the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship. "li'l abner" was censored in september 1947 and was pulled from the pittsburg press by scripps-howard. the controversy, as reported in "time", centered on capp's portrayal of the u.s. senate. said edward leech of scripps, "we don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."
as comics are easier for children to access compared to other types of media, they have a significantly more rigid censorship code than other media. stephan pastis has lamented that the "unwritten" censorship code is still "stuck somewhere in the 1950s." generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as "damn", "sucks", "screwed", and "hell", although there have been exceptions such as the september 22, 2010 "mother goose and grimm" in which an elderly man says, "this nursing home food sucks," and a pair of "pearls before swine" comics from january 11, 2011 with a character named ned using the word "crappy". naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to "dilbert" cartoonist scott adams. such comic strip taboos were detailed in dave breger's book "but that's unprintable" (bantam, 1955).
many issues such as sex, narcotics, and terrorism cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for satire, as in "bloom county". this led some cartoonists to resort to double entendre or dialogue children do not understand, as in greg evans' "luann". young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images, and issues should be allowed in the comics. some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media. webcomics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect.

in mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (abbreviated ch) is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets. it states:
the continuum hypothesis was advanced by georg cantor in 1878, and
establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of hilbert's 23 problems presented in 1900. τhe answer to this problem is independent of zfc set theory (that is, zermelo–fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to zfc set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if zfc is consistent. this independence was proved in 1963 by paul cohen, complementing earlier work by kurt gödel in 1940.
the name of the hypothesis comes from the term "the continuum" for the real numbers.
cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain . it became the first on david hilbert's list of important open questions that was presented at the international congress of mathematicians in the year 1900 in paris. axiomatic set theory was at that point not yet formulated.
kurt gödel proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory. the second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by paul cohen.
two sets are said to have the same "cardinality" or "cardinal number" if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. intuitively, for two sets "s" and "t" to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to "pair off" elements of "s" with elements of "t" in such a fashion that every element of "s" is paired off with exactly one element of "t" and vice versa. hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.
with infinite sets such as the set of integers or rational numbers, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. the rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers. however, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are infinite. it turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size ("cardinality") as the set of integers: they are both countable sets.
cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of integers is strictly smaller than that of the set of real numbers (see cantor's first uncountability proof and cantor's diagonal argument). his proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.
the continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. that is, every set, "s", of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into "s". using the fact that the real numbers are equinumerous with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set formula_1 for which formula_2
assuming the axiom of choice, there is a smallest cardinal number formula_3 greater than formula_4, and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality formula_5
there is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the generalized continuum hypothesis (gch) which says that for every ordinal α, formula_6 that is, gch asserts that the cardinality of the power set of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.
the independence of the continuum hypothesis (ch) from zermelo–fraenkel set theory (zf) follows from combined work of kurt gödel and paul cohen.
cohen (1963, 1964) showed that ch cannot be proven from the zfc axioms, completing the overall independence proof. to prove his result, cohen developed the method of forcing, which has become a standard tool in set theory. essentially, this method begins with a model of zf in which ch holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that ch does not hold in the new model. cohen was awarded the fields medal in 1966 for his proof.
the independence proof just described shows that ch is independent of zfc. further research has shown that ch is independent of all known "large cardinal axioms" in the context of zfc. () moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with könig's theorem. a result of solovay, proved shortly after cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of zfc, if formula_7 is a cardinal of uncountable cofinality, then there is a forcing extension in which formula_8. however, per könig's theorem, it is not consistent to assume formula_9 is formula_10 or formula_11 or any cardinal with cofinality formula_12.
the continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in analysis, point set topology and measure theory. as a result of its independence, many substantial conjectures in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.
the independence from zfc means that proving or disproving the ch within zfc is impossible. however, gödel and cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see and for an overview of the current research status.
the continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of zfc. an immediate consequence of gödel's incompleteness theorem, which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate gödel numbering scheme) expressing the consistency of zfc that is independent of zfc, assuming that zfc is consistent. the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of zf set theory.
gödel believed that ch is false, and that his proof that ch is consistent with zfc only shows that the zermelo–fraenkel axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets. gödel was a platonist and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. cohen, though a formalist , also tended towards rejecting ch.
historically, mathematicians who favored a "rich" and "large" universe of sets were against ch, while those favoring a "neat" and "controllable" universe favored ch. parallel arguments were made for and against the axiom of constructibility, which implies ch. more recently, matthew foreman has pointed out that ontological maximalism can actually be used to argue in favor of ch, because among models that have the same reals, models with "more" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying ch (maddy 1988, p. 500).
another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether ch is true or false. this viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by skolem, even before gödel's first incompleteness theorem. skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as skolem's paradox, and it was later supported by the independence of ch from the axioms of zfc since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. in order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve ch in one direction or another. although the axiom of constructibility does resolve ch, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than ch is generally considered to be false (kunen 1980, p. 171).
at least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. in 1986, chris freiling presented an argument against ch by showing that the negation of ch is equivalent to freiling's axiom of symmetry, a statement about probabilities. freiling believes this axiom is "intuitively true" but others have disagreed. a difficult argument against ch developed by w. hugh woodin has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (woodin 2001a, 2001b). foreman (2003) does not reject woodin's argument outright but urges caution.
solomon feferman (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that ch is not a definite mathematical problem. he proposes a theory of "definiteness" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of zf that accepts classical logic for bounded quantifiers but uses intuitionistic logic for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition formula_13 is mathematically "definite" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove formula_14. he conjectures that ch is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that ch should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. peter koellner (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on feferman's article.
joel david hamkins proposes a multiverse approach to set theory and argues that "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." (hamkins 2012). in a related vein, saharon shelah wrote that he does "not agree with the pure platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. my mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to zfc." (shelah 2003).
the "generalized continuum hypothesis" (gch) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set "s" and that of the power set of "s", then it either has the same cardinality as the set "s" or the same cardinality as the power set of "s". that is, for any infinite cardinal formula_15 there is no cardinal formula_7 such that formula_17 gch is equivalent to:
the beth numbers provide an alternate notation for this condition: formula_20 for every ordinal formula_19
this is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the power set of the integers. it was first suggested by . (for the early history of gch, see ).
like ch, gch is also independent of zfc, but sierpiński proved that zf + gch implies the axiom of choice (ac) (and therefore the negation of the axiom of determinacy, ad), so choice and gch are not independent in zf; there are no models of zf in which gch holds and ac fails. to prove this, sierpiński showed gch implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some aleph number, and thus can be ordered. this is done by showing that n is smaller than formula_22 which is smaller than its own hartogs number—this uses the equality formula_23; for the full proof, see gillman (2002).
kurt gödel showed that gch is a consequence of zf + v=l (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with zfc. as gch implies ch, cohen's model in which ch fails is a model in which gch fails, and thus gch is not provable from zfc. w. b. easton used the method of forcing developed by cohen to prove easton's theorem, which shows it is consistent with zfc for arbitrarily large cardinals formula_24 to fail to satisfy formula_25 much later, foreman and woodin proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that formula_26 holds for every infinite cardinal formula_27 later woodin extended this by showing the consistency of formula_28 for every formula_7. showed that, for each "n" ≥ 1, it is consistent with zfc that for each κ, 2 is the "n"th successor of κ. on the other hand, proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2 is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite.
for any infinite sets a and b, if there is an injection from a to b then there is an injection from subsets of a to subsets of b. thus for any infinite cardinals a and b, formula_30 . if a and b are finite, the stronger inequality formula_31 holds. gch implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.
although the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation formula_32 in all cases. gch implies that (see: hayden & kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):

çevik bir (born 1939) is a retired turkish army general. he was a member of the turkish general staff in the 1990s. he took a major part in several important international missions in the middle east and north africa. he was born in buca, izmir province, in 1939 and is married with one child. çevik bir is of albanian origin.
he graduated from the turkish military academy as an engineer officer in 1958, from the army staff college in 1970 and from the armed forces college in 1971. he graduated from nato defense college, rome, italy in 1973.
from 1973 to 1985, he served at shape, nato's headquarters in belgium. he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded an armed brigade and division in turkey. from 1987 to 1991, he served as major general, and then was promoted to lieutenant general.
after the dictator siad barre’s ousting, conflicts between the general mohammed farah aidid party and other clans in somalia had led to famine and lawlessness throughout the country. an estimated 300,000 people had died from starvation. a combined military force of united states and united nations (under the name "unosom") were deployed to mogadishu, to monitor the ceasefire and deliver food and supplies to the starving people of somali. çevik bir, who was then a lieutenant-general of turkey, became the force commander of unosom ii in april 1993. despite the retreat of us and un forces after several deaths due to local hostilities mainly led by aidid, the introduction of a powerful military force opened the transportation routes, enabling the provision of supplies and ended the famine quickly. he was succeeded as force commander by a malaysian general in january 1994.
he became a four-star general and served three years as vice chairman of the turkish armed forces, then appointed commander of the turkish first army, in istanbul. while he was vice chairman of the taf, he signed the turkish-israeli military coordination agreement in 1996.
çevik bir became the turkish army's deputy chief of general staff shortly after the somali operation and played a vital role in establishing a turkish-israeli entente.
çevik bir retired from the army on august 30, 1999. he is a former member of the association for the study of the middle east and africa (asmea).
on april 12, 2012, bir and 30 other officers were taken in custody for their role in the 1997 military memorandum that forced the then turkish government, led by the refah partisi (welfare party), to step down.
çevik bir, one of the generals who planned the process, said "in turkey we have a marriage of islam and democracy. (…) the child of this marriage is secularism. now this child gets sick from time to time. the turkish armed forces is the doctor which saves the child. depending on how sick the kid is, we administer the necessary medicine to make sure the child recuperates".


collectivism is a cultural value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over self. individuals or groups that subscribe to a collectivist worldview tend to find common values and goals as particularly salient and demonstrate greater orientation toward in-group than toward out-group. the term “in-group” is thought to be more diffusely defined for collectivistic individuals to include societal units ranging from the nuclear family to a religious or racial/ethnic group. meta-analytic findings support that collectivism shows a consistent association with discrete values, interpersonal patterns of interaction, cognition, perception and self-construal. while collectivism is often defined in contrast to individualism, the notion that collectivism-individualism is unidimensional has been challenged by contemporary theorists.
the german sociologist ferdinand tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms "gemeinschaft" (community) and "gesellschaft" (society). "gemeinschaft" relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. an anthropologist, redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.
max weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people.
hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. the author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals.
collectivism was an important part of marxist–leninist ideology in the soviet union, where it played a key part in forming the new soviet man, willingly sacrificing his or her life for the good of the collective. terms such as "collective" and "the masses" were frequently used in the official language and praised in agitprop literature, for example by vladimir mayakovsky ("who needs a "1"") and bertolt brecht (the decision, man equals man).
the construct of collectivism is represented in empirical literature under several different names. most commonly, the term interdependent self-construal is used. other phrases used to describe the concept of collectivism-individualism include allocentrism-idiocentrism, collective-private self, as well as subtypes of collectivism-individualism (meaning, vertical and horizontal subtypes). inconsistent terminology is thought to account for some of the difficulty in effectively synthesizing the empirical literature on collectivism.
typically, collectivism is measured via self-report questionnaire. meta-analytic findings suggest that there are six instruments that have been used to measure collectivism (and the related construct of individualism) in a manner that best reflects current theoretical thinking.
in one critical model of collectivism, markus and kitayama describe the interdependent (i.e., collectivistic) self as fundamentally connected to the social context. as such, one's sense of self depends on and is defined in part by those around them and is primarily manifested in public, overt behavior. as such, the organization of the self is guided by using others as a reference. that is, an interdependent individual uses the unexpressed thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of another person with whom they have a relationship with, as well as the other person's behaviors, to make decisions about their own internal attributes and actions.
markus and kitayama also contributed to the literature by challenging hofstede's unidimensional model of collectivism-individualism. the authors conceptualized these two constructs bidimensionally, such that both collectivism and individualism can be endorsed independently and potentially to the same degree. this notion has been echoed by other prominent theorists in the field.
some researchers have expanded the collectivism-individualism framework to include a more comprehensive view. specifically, triandis and colleagues introduced a theoretical model in which incorporates the notion of relational contexts. the authors argues that the domains of collectivism and individualism can be further described by horizontal and vertical relationships. horizontal relationships are believed to be status-equal whereas vertical relationships are characterized as hierarchical and status-unequal. as such, horizontal collectivism is manifested as an orientation in which group harmony is highly valued and in-group members are perceived to experience equal standing. vertical collectivism involves the prioritization of group goals over individual goals, implying a hierarchical positioning of the self in relation to the overarching in-group. the horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism model has received empirical support and has been used to explore patterns within cultures.
originated by w. e. b. dubois, some researchers have adopted a historical perspective on the emergence of collectivism among some cultural groups. dubois and others argued that oppressed minority groups contend with internal division, meaning that the development of self-identity for individuals from these groups involves the integration of one's own perceptions of their group as well as typically negative, societal views of their group. this division is thought to impact goal formation such that people from marginalized groups tend to emphasize collectivistic over individualistic values.
some organizational research has found different variations of collectivism. these include institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism. institutional collectivism is the idea that a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards, such as earning the same salary. in-group collectivism is the idea that an individual's chosen group of people, such as family or friend groups, create a sense of collectivist nature. in-group collectivism can be referred to as family collectivism.
a number of classic studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between collectivism and cognition. these studies support the notion that people from collectivistic cultures tend to demonstrate a holistic cognitive style, which is reflected in processes such as memory, visual perception, attributional style, and categorization schemas. this effect has been replicated extensively by independent research groups, supporting its robustness.
an individual's self-concept can be fundamentally shaped by cultural values. such processes typically begin in childhood and adolescence and parents are often one of the first critical inputs that shape a child's sense of self-concept. parents with more collectivistic world views have been shown to speak and interact with their children in a manner that conveys the core tenets of collectivism, such as emphasis on the relationships between objects and interpersonal connections. as such, youth who are parented in this manner tend to develop a sense of self that is defined in relation to others. this sense of self also has been found to be reflected in patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the brain. for example, generally the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) is more active when adults think about themselves compared to when they think about someone else. however, for adults who endorse collectivism, the mpfc actually shows greater response when they think about themselves in the context of their close relationships.
cultural views are believed to have a reciprocal relationship with macro-level processes such as economics, social change, and politics. societal changes in china exemplifies this well. beginning in the early 1980s, china experienced dramatic expansion of economic and social structures, resulting in greater income inequality between families, less involvement of the government in social welfare programs, and increased competition for employment. corresponding with these changes was a shift in ideology among chinese citizens, especially among those who were younger, away from collectivism (the prevailing cultural ideology) toward individualism. china also saw this shift reflected in educational policies, such that teachers were encouraged to promote the development of their students’ individual opinions and self-efficacy, which prior to the aforementioned economic changes, was not emphasized in chinese culture.
attempts to study the association of collectivism and political views and behaviors has largely occurred at the aggregate national level. however, more isolated political movements have also adopted a collectivistic framework. for example, collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary anarchist doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production. it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

nepeta is a genus of flowering plants in the family lamiaceae. the genus name is reportedly in reference to nepete, an ancient etruscan city. there are about 250 species.
the genus is native to europe, asia, and africa, and has also naturalized in north america.
some members of this group are known as catnip or catmint because of their effect on house cats – the nepetalactone contained in some "nepeta" species binds to the olfactory receptors of cats, typically resulting in temporary euphoria.
most of the species are herbaceous perennial plants, but some are annuals. they have sturdy stems with opposite heart-shaped, green to gray-green leaves. "nepeta" plants are usually aromatic in foliage and flowers.
the tubular flowers can be lavender, blue, white, pink, or lilac, and spotted with tiny lavender-purple dots. the flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite cymes, racemes, or panicles – toward the tip of the stems.
the calyx is tubular or campanulate, they are slightly curved or straight, and the limbs are often 2-lipped with five teeth. the lower lip is larger, with 3-lobes, and the middle lobe is the largest. the flowers have 4 hairless stamens that are nearly parallel, and they ascend under the upper lip of the corolla. two stamen are longer and stamens of pistillate flowers are rudimentary. the style protrudes outside of the mouth of the flowers.
the fruits are nutlets, which are oblong-ovoid, ellipsoid, ovoid, or obovoid in shape. the surfaces of the nutlets can be slightly ribbed, smooth or warty.
species include:
some "nepeta" species are cultivated as ornamental plants. they can be drought tolerant – water conserving, often deer repellent, with long bloom periods from late spring to autumn. some species also have repellent properties to insect pests, including aphids and squash bugs, when planted in a garden.
"nepeta" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including "coleophora albitarsella", and as nectar sources for pollinators, such as honey bees and hummingbirds.

the cornish nationalist party (cnp; ) is a political party, founded by dr james whetter, who campaigned for independence for cornwall. it was formed by people who left cornwall's main nationalist party mebyon kernow on 28 may 1975, but it is no longer for independence.
a separate party with a similar name (cornish national party) existed from 1969.
the split with mebyon kernow was based on the same debate that was occurring in most of the other political parties campaigning for autonomy from the united kingdom at the time (such as the scottish national party and plaid cymru): whether to be a centre-left party, appealing to the electorate on a social democratic line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a centre-right cultural line. originally, another subject of the split was whether to embrace devolution as a first step to full independence (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for it to be "all or nothing".
the cnp essentially represented a more right-wing outlook from those who disagree that economic arguments were more likely to win votes than cultural. the cnp worked to preserve the celtic identity of cornwall and improve its economy, and encouraged links with cornish people overseas and with other regions with distinct identities. it also gave support to the cornish language and commemorated thomas flamank, a leader of the cornish rebellion in 1497, at an annual ceremony at bodmin on 27 june each year.
the policy statement and programme of the cnp were published in 1975 and included the following points:
while the cnp is not a racist organisation, there was a perceived image problem from the similarly-styled bnp and nf (the nativist british national party and national front), and during the 1970s letters were published in the party magazine "the cornish banner" ("an baner kernewek") sympathetic to the nf and critical of "zionist" politicians.the cnp also formed a controversial uniformed wing known as the "greenshirts" led by the cnp youth movement leader and public relations officer, wallace simmons who also founded the pro-nf "cornish front". (although the cnp and cf were sympathetic to irish republicanism while the nf was supportive of ulster loyalism, with the exception of leading nf figures like patrick harrington, who refused to condemn the ira during an interview for the channel 4 tv documentary "disciples of chaos").
the cnp was for some time seen as more of a pressure group, as it did not put up candidates for any elections, although its visibility and influence within cornwall is negligible. , it is now registered on the uk political parties register, and so mebyon kernow is no longer the only registered political party based in cornwall. in april 2009, a news story reported that the cnp had re-formed following a conference in bodmin; however, it did not contest any elections that year.
the cnp polled 227 (0.4) votes in truro during the 1979 uk general election, 364 (0.67) in north cornwall in the 1983 uk general election, and 1,892 (1.0) at the european parliament elections in the cornwall and plymouth constituency in 1984. the candidate on all three occasions was the founder and first leader of the cnp, dr james whetter.
dr whetter was the founder and editor of the cnp quarterly journal, "the cornish banner" ("an baner kernewek"), within the actions of the roseland institute. since his death in 2018 the cnp has been led by androw hawke.
a newspaper article and a revamp of the party website in october 2014 state that the party is now to contest elections once more.
john le bretton, vice-chairman of the party, said: "the cnp supports the retention of cornwall council as a cornwall-wide authority running cornish affairs and we call for the british government in westminster to devolve powers to the council so that decisions affecting cornwall can be made in cornwall".
the party's policies include the following:
the cnp has one parish councillor, cnp leader androw hawke who was elected to polperro community council for the second time on 4 may 2017.
the reformed party was registered with the electoral commission in 2014, but ceased to be registered in 2017.
the cnp now operates as more of a pressure group standing candidates as independents in local elections in cornwall.

cryptanalysis (from the greek "kryptós", "hidden", and "analýein", "to loosen" or "to untie") is the study of analyzing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems. cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.
in addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation.
even though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography, adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper methods of the past, through machines like the british bombes and colossus computers at bletchley park in world war ii, to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present. methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve solving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics, the best-known being integer factorization.
given some encrypted data (""ciphertext""), the goal of the "cryptanalyst" is to gain as much information as possible about the original, unencrypted data (""plaintext""). it is useful to consider two aspects of achieving this. the first is "breaking" the system — that is discovering how the encipherment process works. the second is "solving" the key that is unique for a particular encrypted message or group of messages.
attacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available. as a basic starting point it is normally assumed that, for the purposes of analysis, the general algorithm is known; this is shannon's maxim "the enemy knows the system" — in its turn, equivalent to kerckhoffs' principle. this is a reasonable assumption in practice — throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through espionage, betrayal and reverse engineering. (and on occasion, ciphers have been broken through pure deduction; for example, the german lorenz cipher and the japanese purple code, and a variety of classical schemes):
attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require. those resources include:
it's sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack isn't practical to actually implement for testing. but academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated "order of magnitude" of their attacks' difficulty, saying, for example, "sha-1 collisions now 2."
bruce schneier notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks: "breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force. never mind that brute-force might require 2 encryptions; an attack requiring 2 encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised."
the results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness. for example, cryptographer lars knudsen (1998) classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:
academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem, such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed. many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem, so it's possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak. nonetheless, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the successful attacks on des, md5, and sha-1 were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions.
in academic cryptography, a "weakness" or a "break" in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory, or known plaintexts. it also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can't: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key. furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers. finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking of the full system.
cryptanalysis has coevolved together with cryptography, and the contest can be traced through the history of cryptography—new ciphers being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes. in practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis.
successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history; the ability to read the presumed-secret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage. for example, in england in 1587, mary, queen of scots was tried and executed for treason as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate elizabeth i of england. the plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by thomas phelippes.
in world war i, the breaking of the zimmermann telegram was instrumental in bringing the united states into the war. in world war ii, the allies benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the german ciphers — including the enigma machine and the lorenz cipher — and japanese ciphers, particularly 'purple' and jn-25. 'ultra' intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the european war by up to two years, to determining the eventual result. the war in the pacific was similarly helped by 'magic' intelligence.
governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for intelligence, both military and diplomatic, and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations, for example, gchq and the nsa, organizations which are still very active today. in 2004, it was reported that the united states had broken iranian ciphers. (it is unknown, however, whether this was pure cryptanalysis, or whether other factors were involved:).
although the actual word ""cryptanalysis"" is relatively recent (it was coined by william friedman in 1920), methods for breaking codes and ciphers are much older. the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by 9th-century arab polymath, al-kindi (also known as "alkindus" in europe), in "a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages". this treatise includes a description of the method of frequency analysis (ibrahim al-kadi, 1992- ref-3). italian scholar giambattista della porta was author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis ""de furtivis literarum notis"."
frequency analysis is the basic tool for breaking most classical ciphers. in natural languages, certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others; in english, "e" is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of plaintext. similarly, the digraph "th" is the most likely pair of letters in english, and so on. frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these statistics. for example, in a simple substitution cipher (where each letter is simply replaced with another), the most frequent letter in the ciphertext would be a likely candidate for "e". frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy, provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains.
in europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, the idea of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher was developed, among others by the french diplomat blaise de vigenère (1523–96). for some three centuries, the vigenère cipher, which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure ("le chiffre indéchiffrable"—"the indecipherable cipher"). nevertheless, charles babbage (1791–1871) and later, independently, friedrich kasiski (1805–81) succeeded in breaking this cipher. during world war i, inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as arthur scherbius' enigma, in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the vigenère system.
cryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the allied victory in world war ii. f. w. winterbotham, quoted the western supreme allied commander, dwight d. eisenhower, at the war's end as describing ultra intelligence as having been "decisive" to allied victory. sir harry hinsley, official historian of british intelligence in world war ii, made a similar assessment about ultra, saying that it shortened the war "by not less than two years and probably by four years"; moreover, he said that in the absence of ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.
in practice, frequency analysis relies as much on linguistic knowledge as it does on statistics, but as ciphers became more complex, mathematics became more important in cryptanalysis. this change was particularly evident before and during world war ii, where efforts to crack axis ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication. moreover, automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the polish bomba device, the british bombe, the use of punched card equipment, and in the colossus computers — the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program.
with reciprocal machine ciphers such as the lorenz cipher and the enigma machine used by nazi germany during world war ii, each message had its own key. usually, the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext and/or ciphertext before the enciphered message. this is termed the "indicator", as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message.
poorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first polish cryptographers and then the british cryptographers at bletchley park to break the enigma cipher system. similar poor indicator systems allowed the british to identify "depths" that led to the diagnosis of the lorenz sz40/42 cipher system, and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine.
sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process. to a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be ""in depth."" this may be detected by the messages having the same "indicator" by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the key generator initial settings for the message.
generally, the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages. for example, the vernam cipher enciphers by bit-for-bit combining plaintext with a long key using the "exclusive or" operator, which is also known as "modulo-2 addition" (symbolized by ⊕ ):
deciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext:
(in modulo-2 arithmetic, addition is the same as subtraction.) when two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth, combining them eliminates the common key, leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts:
the individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying "probable words" (or phrases), also known as ""cribs,"" at various locations; a correct guess, when combined with the merged plaintext stream, produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component:
the recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions, and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext. working back and forth between the two plaintexts, using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses, the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts. (with only two plaintexts in depth, the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext, but in practice this is not a large problem.) when a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext, the key is revealed:
knowledge of a key of course allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key, and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them.
even though computation was used to great effect in cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher and other systems during world war ii, it also made possible new methods of cryptography orders of magnitude more complex than ever before. taken as a whole, modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the pen-and-paper systems of the past, and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis. the historian david kahn notes:
kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception, bugging, side channel attacks, and quantum computers as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis. in 2010, former nsa technical director brian snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are "moving very slowly forward in a mature field."
however, any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature. while the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown, many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography:
thus, while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the enigma, cryptanalysis and the broader field of information security remain quite active.
asymmetric cryptography (or public key cryptography) is cryptography that relies on using two (mathematically related) keys; one private, and one public. such ciphers invariably rely on "hard" mathematical problems as the basis of their security, so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem. the security of two-key cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that single-key cryptography generally does not, and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way.
asymmetric schemes are designed around the (conjectured) difficulty of solving various mathematical problems. if an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem, then the system is weakened. for example, the security of the diffie–hellman key exchange scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the discrete logarithm. in 1983, don coppersmith found a faster way to find discrete logarithms (in certain groups), and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups (or different types of groups). rsa's security depends (in part) upon the difficulty of integer factorization — a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of rsa.
in 1980, one could factor a difficult 50-digit number at an expense of 10 elementary computer operations. by 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75-digit number could be factored in 10 operations. advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster, too. moore's law predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase. factoring techniques may continue to do so as well, but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity, neither of which has ever been successfully predictable. 150-digit numbers of the kind once used in rsa have been factored. the effort was greater than above, but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers. by the start of the 21st century, 150-digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough key size for rsa. numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005, though methods will probably continue to improve over time, requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as elliptic curve cryptography to be used.
another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that, unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems, any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the public key.
quantum computers, which are still in the early phases of research, have potential use in cryptanalysis. for example, shor's algorithm could factor large numbers in polynomial time, in effect breaking some commonly used forms of public-key encryption.
by using grover's algorithm on a quantum computer, brute-force key search can be made quadratically faster. however, this could be countered by doubling the key length.

chicano or chicana is a chosen identity of some mexican americans in the united states. the term "chicano" is sometimes used interchangeably with "mexican-american". both names are chosen identities within the mexican-american community in the united states; however, these terms have a wide range of meanings in various parts of the southwest. the term became widely used during the chicano movement by mexican americans to express pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.
the term "chicano" had negative connotations before the chicano movement, and still is viewed negatively and archaic by more conservative members of this community. over time, it has gained some acceptance as an identity of pride within the mexican-american community in the united states.
the pro-indigenous/mestizo nature of chicano nationalism is cemented in the idea of mestizaje. ultimately, it was the experience of mexican americans in the united states which culminated in the creation of a chicano identity.
the chicano poet and writer tino villanueva traced the first documented use of the term as an ethnonym to 1911, as referenced in a then-unpublished essay by university of texas anthropologist josé limón. linguists edward r. simmen and richard f. bauerle report the use of the term in an essay by mexican-american writer, mario suárez, published in the "arizona quarterly" in 1947.
in 1857, a gunboat, the "chicana", was sold to jose maria carvajal to ship arms on the rio grande. the king and kenedy firm submitted a voucher to the joint claims commission of the united states in 1870 to cover the costs of this gunboat's conversion from a passenger steamer. no particular explanation of the boat's name is known.
the origin of the word "chicano" is disputed. some claim it is a shortened form of "mexicano" (from the nahuatl name for a member of the mexica, the indigenous aztec people of anahuac, the valley of mexico). the name "mexica" as spoken in its original nahuatl, and "mexico" by the spaniards at the time of the conquistadors, was pronounced originally with a [] and was transcribed with an "x" during this time period. according to this etymological hypothesis, the difference between the pronunciation and spelling of "chicano" and "mexicano" stems from the fact that the modern-day spanish language experienced a change in pronunciation regarding a majority of words containing the "x" (for example: méxico, ximenez, xavier, xarabe). in most cases the has been replaced with [] and a change of spelling ("x" to "j", though this has not been done to "mexico" and various other proper names). the word "chicano" would have also been affected by this change. many chicanos replace the "ch" with the letter "x", forming "xicano", due to the original spelling of the mexica empire. in the united states, some mexican-americans choose the "xicano" spelling to emphasize their indigenous ancestry.
in mexico's indigenous regions, mestizos and westernized natives are referred to as "mexicanos", referring to the modern nation, rather than the ' (village or tribal) identification of the speaker, be it mayan, zapotec, mixtec, huasteco, or any of hundreds of other indigenous groups. thus, a newly emigrated nahuatl speaker in an urban center might referred to his cultural relatives in this country, different from himself, as ', shortened to "chicanos".
the "handbook of texas" combines the two ideas:
some believe that the early 20th-century hispanic texan epithet "chicamo" shifted into "chicano" to reflect the grammatical conventions of spanish-language ethno- and demonyms, such as "americano", "castellano", and "peruano". however, chicanos generally do not agree that "chicamo" was ever a word used within the culture, as its assertion is thus far entirely unsubstantiated. therefore, most self-identifying chicanos do not agree that "chicano" was ever derived from the word "chicamo".
another hypothesis is that "chicano" derives from the indigenous population of guanajuato, the chichimecas, combined with the word "mexicano". an alternative idea is that it is an altered form of "chilango", meaning someone from mexico city or central mexico (i.e. the highland states of méxico, sinaloa, jalisco, puebla and michoacán). a similar notion is that the word derives from chichen itza, the mayan temple ruin and its associated culture in mexico's yucatán peninsula. "chicano" would thus be a hispanized word for "chichen" and mayans, rather than the aztec or nahua people.
chicanos, like many mexicans, are mestizos who have heritage of both indigenous american cultures and european, mainly spanish, through colonization and immigration. the term "latino" refers to a native or inhabitant of latin america or a person of latin american origin living in the u.s.
"hispanic" refers literally to spain, but, in effect, to those of spanish-speaking descent; therefore, the two terms are misnomers inasmuch as they apply only by extension to chicanos, who may identify primarily as amerindian or simply mexican, and who may speak amerindian languages (and english) as well as spanish. the term was first brought up in the 1970s but it was not until the 1990s that the term was used on the u.s. census. since then it has widely been used by politicians and the media.
the term's meanings are highly debatable, but self-described chicanos view the term as a positive, self-identifying social construction. outside of mexican-american communities, and even within them, "chicano" has sometimes been considered pejorative by those who do not prefer the term. regardless, its implications are subjective, but usually consist of one or more of the following elements.
from a popular perspective, the term "chicano" became widely visible outside of chicano communities during the american civil rights movement. it was commonly used during the mid-1960s by mexican-american activists, who, in attempts to assert their civil rights, tried to rid the word of its polarizing negative connotation by reasserting a unique ethnic identity and political consciousness, proudly identifying themselves as "chicanos".
although the u.s. federal census bureau provided no way for mexican americans or other latinos to officially identify as a racial/ethnic category prior to 1980, when the broader-than-mexican term "hispanic" was first available as a self-identification in census forms, there is ample literary evidence to substantiate that "chicano" is a long-standing endonym, as a large body of chicano literature pre-dates the 1950s.
according to the "handbook of texas":
at certain points in the 1970s, "chicano" was the preferred term for reference to mexican americans, particularly in the scholarly literature. however, even though the term is politicized, its use fell out of favor as a means of referring to the entire population due to ignorance and due to the majority's attempt to impose latino and hispanic as misnomers. because of this, "chicano" has tended to refer to participants in mexican-american activism. sabine ulibarrí, an author from tierra amarilla, new mexico, once labeled "chicano" as a politically "loaded" term, though later recanted that assessment.
since the chicano movement, the term chicano has been used and associated by those of mexican-american descent. with mass media, chicano culture became popular in both the united states and internationally.
in japan, the highlights of chicano culture include the music, the lowrider community, and the arts. chicano culture in japan has been around since the '80s and continues to grow due to the contributions from individuals such as shin miyata, junichi shimodaira, miki style, night tha funksta, and mona (sad girl). the introduction of chicano culture in japan has caused thousands of individuals to enjoy and live the lifestyle that the chicanos are known for. the adoption of chicano culture in japan has often been labeled as cultural appropriation because of japanese copying the essence of the culture. the japanese are not culture appropriating the chicano culture for profit, but they acknowledge the culture not being their own and have great admiration for it. rather than appreciating the culture through superficial means, the japanese locals appreciate the similarity of the roots of the culture since it is reflected upon their own culture. both chicano and japanese cultures have parallels with the importance of family and the discrimination and racism they incurred in the united states. . chicano culture allowed the chicanos to express themselves politically and socially through the lowrider community, the music, and more which appealed to the japanese. the appreciation of the blending of cultures is even appreciated by chicanos and chicanas themselves for they are proud to be recognized as people even outside the united states.
the identity may be seen as uncertain. for example, in the 1991 culture clash play "a bowl of beings", in response to che guevara's demand for a definition of "chicano", an "armchair activist" cries out, "i still don't know!". juan bruce-novoa, a professor of spanish and portuguese at university of california, irvine, wrote in 1990: "a chicano lives in the space between the hyphen in mexican-american".
for chicanos, the term usually implies being "neither from here, nor from there" in reference to the us and mexico. as a mixture of cultures from both countries, being chicano represents the struggle of being institutionally acculturated into the anglo-dominated society of the united states, while maintaining the cultural sense developed as a latin-american cultured, us-born mexican child.
the identity may be seen as native to the land, and distinct from a european identity, despite partial european descent. as exemplified through its extensive use within el plan de santa bárbara, one of the primary documents responsible for the genesis of m.e.ch.a. (movimiento estudiantil chicanx de aztlán), chicano is used by many as a reference to their indigenous ancestry and roots. the last word in m.e.ch.a., aztlán, is a mexica reference to an ancestral homeland which historians have speculated is somewhere in northern mexico or the southwest of the us. m.e.ch.a. is one example of how people have self-identified as chicano as a means to identify with indigenous roots.
as rubén salazar put it in "who is a chicano? and what is it the chicanos want?", a 1970 "los angeles times" piece: "a chicano is a mexican-american with a non-anglo image of himself." according to leo limón, an artist and community activist in los angeles states, "...a chicano is ... an indigenous mexican american".
chicano also has variations such as chicanx, xicano/a, xicanx. the term chicano because widely used during the chicano movement to express pride in cultural, ethnic and community identity. by replacing the 'ch' with the letter 'x', i.e. xicano, is representing the original spelling of the mexica empire. xicano is a first generation way of spelling chicano.
the nahuatl language used hieroglyphics, the sound 'ch' written in greco-roman alphabet was put in place by the spanish. therefore, changing how the 'x' was used.
reies tijerina (who died on january 19, 2015) was a vocal claimant to the rights of latin-americans and mexican americans, and he remains a major figure of the early chicano movement. of the term, he wrote: "the anglo press degradized the word 'chicano'. they use it to divide us. we use it to unify ourselves with our people and with latin america."
long a disparaging term in mexico, the term "chicano" gradually transformed from a class-based label of derision to one of ethnic pride and general usage within mexican-american communities, beginning with the rise of the chicano movement in the 1960s. in their "latinas in the united states: a historical encyclopedia", vicki ruíz and virginia sánchez report that demographic differences in the adoption of the term existed; because of the prior vulgar connotations, it was more likely to be used by males than females, and as well, less likely to be used among those in a higher socioeconomic status. usage was also generational, with the more assimilated third-generation members (again, more likely male) likely to adopt the usage. this group was also younger, of more radical persuasion, and less-connected to a mexican cultural heritage.
in his essay "chicanismo" in "the oxford encyclopedia of mesoamerican cultures" (2002), josé cuéllar, a professor of chicano studies at san francisco state university, dates the transition from derisive to positive to the late 1950s, with a usage by young mexican-american high school students.
outside of mexican-american communities, the term might assume a negative meaning if it is used in a manner that embodies the prejudices and bigotries long directed at mexican and mexican-american people in the united states. for example, in one case, a prominent chicana feminist writer and poet has indicated the following subjective meaning through her creative work.
ana castillo has referred to herself as a chicana, and her literary work reflects that she primarily considers the term to be a positive one of self-determination and political solidarity.
the mexican archeologist and anthropologist manuel gamio reported in 1930 that the term "chicamo" (with an "m") was used as a derogatory term used by hispanic texans for recently arrived mexican immigrants displaced during the mexican revolution in the beginning of the early 20th century. at this time, the term "chicano" began to reference those who resisted total assimilation, while the term "pochos" referred (often pejoratively) to those who strongly advocated assimilation.
in mexico, which by american standards would be considered class discrimination or racist, the term is associated with a mexican-american person of low importance class and poor morals (similarly to the spanish terms cholo, chulo and majo). the term "chicano" is widely known and used in mexico.
while some mexican americans may embrace the term "chicano", others prefer to identify themselves as:
when it comes to the use of loanwords, romance-language orthographies, unlike french for example, do not use uppercase for non-name nouns, such as those used for nationalities or ethnic groups, of whatever sort – even chicano/chicana are best written with lowercase as " in spanish and related languages suchs portuguese, galician, and catalan.
some of them might be used more commonly in english and others in spanish: e.g. one might identify as a "mexican" in a mixed american context, in which english would generally be expected, but to identify as part of the white/euro-american demographic segment of the ethnic mexican populations, in a strictly mexican or mexican-american context, in which one might be speaking spanish.
anyone from the united states is referred to in spanish as ' or '. romance languages conserved the original standard (formerly shared with english) of counting the entire new world as a single america, as was the consensus in the age of discovery; to spanish- and portuguese-speakers in the americas, they are just as "americano" as someone from belgium would be european. geological validation of the current english norm is bound by controversies and potential inconsistency, so the best explanation for both cases is mere tradition.
' refers to the mexicans of northern mexico as opposed to '. mexican americans do not refer to their shared identity as '. the only people who identify themselves as such are mexicans from northern mexico which represents the whiter and relatively wealthier half of mexico, compared to ' or southern mexicans, more related in descent to the original indigenous peoples of the continent and thus being the ones to actually have greater likelihood for an identity a bit closer to the militant chicano one. mainstream spanish-language discourse does not treat the american southwest as a contemporary part of mexico (cultural, identitarian or otherwise), and the indigenist chicano nationalism is hardly related at all to non-american mexican desire for reconquering, an irredentist narrative of what might be perceived as a colonial state and collective mentality.
militant chicanos, regardless of their generational status, tend to connect their culture to the indigenous peoples of north america and to a nation of aztlán, ignoring their european heritage. according to the aztec legend, aztlán is a region; chicano nationalists have equated it with the southwestern united states.
some historians may place aztlán in nayarit or the caribbean while other historians entirely disagree, and make a distinction between legend and the contemporary socio-political ideology.
many currents came together to produce the revived chicano political movement of the 1960s and 1970s. early struggles were against school segregation, but the mexican-american cause, or " as it was called, soon came under the banner of the united farm workers and césar chávez. however, corky gonzales and reies tijerina stirred up old tensions about new mexican land claims with roots going back to before the mexican–american war. simultaneous movements like the young lords, to empower youth, question patriarchy, democratize the church, end police brutality, and end the vietnam war, all intersected with other ethnic nationalist, peace, countercultural, and feminist movements.
since chicanismo covers a wide array of political, religious and ethnic beliefs, and not everybody agrees with what exactly a chicano is, most new latino immigrants see it as a lost cause, as a lost culture, because chicanos do not identify with mexico or wherever their parents migrated from as new immigrants do. chicanoism is an appreciation of a historical movement, but also is used by many to bring a new revived politicized feeling to voters young and old in the defense of mexican and mexican-american rights. people descended from aztlan (both in the contemporary u.s. and in mexico) use the chicano ideology to create a platform for fighting for immigration reform and equality for all people.
for some, chicano ideals involve a rejection of borders. the 1848 treaty of guadalupe hidalgo transformed the rio grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the united states government. at the end of the mexican–american war, 80,000 spanish-mexican-indian people were forced into sudden u.s. habitation. as a result, chicano identification is aligned with the idea of aztlán, which extends to the aztec period of mexico, celebrating a time preceding land division.
paired with the dissipation of militant political efforts of the chicano movement in the 1960s was the emergence of the chicano generation. like their political predecessors, the chicano generation rejects the "immigrant/foreigner" categorization status. chicano identity has expanded from its political origins to incorporate a broader community vision of social integration and nonpartisan political participation.
the shared spanish language, catholic faith, close contact with their political homeland (mexico) to the south, a history of labor segregation, ethnic exclusion and racial discrimination encourage a united "chicano" or mexican folkloric tradition in the united states. ethnic cohesiveness is a resistance strategy to assimilation and the accompanying cultural dissolution.
mexican nationalists in mexico, however, condemn the advocates of chicanoism for attempting to create a new identity for the mexican-american population, distinct from that of the mexican nation. chicanoism is embraced through personal identity especially within small rural communities that integrate the american culture connected to the mexican heritage practiced in different parts of mexico.
the term "chicano" is also used to describe the literary, artistic, and musical movements that emerged with the chicano movement.
chicano literature tends to focus on themes of identity, discrimination, and culture, with an emphasis on validating mexican-american and chicano culture in the united states. rodolfo "corky" gonzales's "yo soy joaquin" is one of the first examples of explicitly chicano poetry, while josé antonio villarreal's "pocho" is widely recognized as the first major chicano novel.
the novel "chicano", by richard vasquez, was the first novel about mexican americans to be released by a major publisher (doubleday, 1970). it was widely read in high schools and universities during the 1970s, and is now recognized as a breakthrough novel. vasquez's social themes have been compared with those found in the work of upton sinclair and john steinbeck.
other major names include norma elia cantú, rudolfo anaya, sandra cisneros, gary soto, sergio troncoso, rigoberto gonzález, raul salinas, oscar zeta acosta, daniel olivas, john rechy, ana castillo, denise chávez, benjamin alire sáenz, luís alberto urrea, dagoberto gilb, alicia gaspar de alba, luis j. rodriguez, pat mora, and gloria anzaldúa.
in the visual arts, works by chicanos address similar themes as works in literature. the preferred media for chicano art are murals and graphic arts. san diego's chicano park, home to the largest collection of murals in the world, was created as an outgrowth of the city's political movement by chicanos. rasquache art is a unique style subset of the chicano arts movement.
chicano art emerged in the mid-60s as a necessary component to the urban and agrarian civil rights movement in the southwest, known as ', ', or the chicano renaissance. the artistic spirit, based on historical and traditional cultural evolution, within the movement has continued into the present millennium. there are artists, for example, who have chosen to do work within ancestral/historical references or who have mastered traditional techniques. some artists and crafters have transcended the motifs, forms, functions, and context of chicano references in their work but still acknowledge their identity as chicano. these emerging artists are incorporating new materials to present mixed-media, digital media, and transmedia works.
chicano performance art blends humor and pathos for tragicomic effect as shown by los angeles' comedy troupe culture clash and mexican-born performance artist guillermo gómez-peña and nao bustamante is a chicana artist known internationally for her conceptual art pieces and as a participant in "", produced by sarah jessica parker. lalo alcaraz often depicts the issues of chicanos in his cartoon series called "la cucaracha".
one of the most powerful and far-reaching cultural aspects of chicano culture is the indigenous current that strongly roots chicano culture to the american continent. it also unifies ' within the larger pan-indian movement. since its arrival in 1974, an art movement known as ' in the u.s., (and known by several names in its homeland of the central states of mexico: ', ', "", and so on.) has had a deep impact in chicano muralism, graphic design, tattoo art (flash), poetry, music, and literature. lowrider cars also figure prominently as functional art in the chicano community.
chicano art has also been trending in japan especially among the youth. the capital for chicano art in japan is located in osaka, japan. night tha funksta is one of the leading figures of chicano art and provided his own take for his artwork. chicano culture is often associated with the gangs and cholos which appeals to the japanese youth with the idea of rebellion. instead of focusing on the images of gangs, night focuses his art on the more positive images of the chicano culture and its roots. chicano art in japan revolves around the theme or family and belonging in a community and avoids gang-related activities such as drugs and violence.
lalo guerrero has been lauded as the "father of chicano music". beginning in the 1930s, he wrote songs in the big band and swing genres that were popular at the time. he expanded his repertoire to include songs written in traditional genres of mexican music, and during the farmworkers' rights campaign, wrote music in support of césar chávez and the united farm workers.
jeffrey lee pierce of the gun club often spoke about being half mexican and growing up with the chicano culture.
other chicano/mexican-american singers include selena, who sang a mixture of mexican, tejano, and american popular music, but died in 1995 at the age of 23; zack de la rocha, lead vocalist of rage against the machine and social activist; and los lonely boys, a texas-style country rock band who have not ignored their mexican-american roots in their music. in recent years, a growing tex-mex polka band trend influenced by the ' and ' music of mexican immigrants, has in turn influenced much new chicano folk music, especially on large-market spanish language radio stations and on television music video programs in the u.s. some of these artists, like the band quetzal, are known for the political content of political songs.
the chicano movement was affected not only those in the united states and mexico but the chicano culture has also gone abroad to countries such as japan. influencers such as shin miyata raised the awareness of chicano culture in japan. miyata owns a record label, gold barrio records, that rereleases chicano music in japan from chicano soul to chicano rap.
in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a wave of chicano pop music surfaced through innovative musicians carlos santana, johnny rodriguez, ritchie valens and linda ronstadt. joan baez, who was also of mexican-american descent, included hispanic themes in some of her protest folk songs. chicano rock is rock music performed by chicano groups or music with themes derived from chicano culture.
there are two undercurrents in chicano rock. one is a devotion to the original rhythm and blues roots of rock and roll including ritchie valens, sunny and the sunglows, and ? and the mysterians. groups inspired by this include sir douglas quintet, thee midniters, los lobos, war, tierra, and el chicano, and, of course, the chicano blues man himself, the late randy garribay.
the second theme is the openness to latin american sounds and influences. trini lopez, santana, malo, azteca, toro, ozomatli and other chicano latin rock groups follow this approach. chicano rock crossed paths of other latin rock genres (rock en español) by cubans, puerto ricans, such as joe bataan and ralphi pagan and south america (nueva canción). rock band the mars volta combines elements of progressive rock with traditional mexican folk music and latin rhythms along with cedric bixler-zavala's spanglish lyrics.
chicano punk is a branch of chicano rock. there were many bands that emerged from the california punk scene, including the zeros, bags, los illegals, the brat, the plugz, manic hispanic, and the cruzados; as well as others from outside of california including mydolls from houston, texas and los crudos from chicago, illinois. some music historians argue that chicanos of los angeles in the late 1970s might have independently co-founded punk rock along with the already-acknowledged founders from british-european sources when introduced to the us in major cities. the rock band ? and the mysterians, which was composed primarily of mexican-american musicians, was the first band to be described as punk rock. the term was reportedly coined in 1971 by rock critic dave marsh in a review of their show for "creem" magazine.
although latin jazz is most popularly associated with artists from the caribbean (particularly cuba) and brazil, young mexican americans have played a role in its development over the years, going back to the 1930s and early 1940s, the era of the zoot suit, when young mexican-american musicians in los angeles and san jose, such as jenni rivera, began to experiment with "", a jazz-like fusion genre that has grown recently in popularity among mexican americans.
chicano rap is a unique style of hip hop music which started with kid frost, who saw some mainstream exposure in the early 1990s. while mellow man ace was the first mainstream rapper to use spanglish, frost's song "la raza" paved the way for its use in american hip hop. chicano rap tends to discuss themes of importance to young urban chicanos. some of today's chicano artists include a.l.t., lil rob, psycho realm, baby bash, serio, a lighter shade of brown, and funky aztecs sir dyno,chingo bling.
chicano rap has also reached overseas in japan. mona (sad girl) is a chicano-style rapper based in japan who creates new rap music based on chicano culture. mona is well known in japan as well as cities such as san diego and los angeles where chicano culture thrives in.
paula deanda, frankie j, and victor ivan santos (early member of the kumbia kings and associated with baby bash).

the canary islands (; , ) are a spanish archipelago and the southernmost autonomous community of spain located in the atlantic ocean, west of morocco at the closest point. the canary islands, which are also known informally as "the canaries", are among the outermost regions (omr) of the european union proper. it is also one of the eight regions with special consideration of historical nationality recognized as such by the spanish government. the canary islands belong to the african plate like the spanish cities of ceuta and melilla, the two on the african mainland.
the seven main islands are (from largest to smallest in area) tenerife, fuerteventura, gran canaria, lanzarote, la palma, la gomera and el hierro. the archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets: la graciosa, alegranza, isla de lobos, montaña clara, roque del oeste and roque del este. it also includes a series of adjacent roques (those of salmor, fasnia, bonanza, garachico and anaga). in ancient times, the island chain was often referred to as "the fortunate isles". the canary islands are the most southerly region of spain and the largest and most populated archipelago of the macaronesia region. historically, the canary islands have been considered a bridge between four continents: africa, north america, south america and europe.
the archipelago's beaches, climate and important natural attractions, especially maspalomas in gran canaria and teide national park and mount teide (a world heritage site) in tenerife (the third tallest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor), make it a major tourist destination with over 12 million visitors per year, especially tenerife, gran canaria, fuerteventura and lanzarote. the islands have a subtropical climate, with long hot summers and moderately warm winters. the precipitation levels and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation. green areas as well as desert exist on the archipelago. due to their location above the temperature inversion layer, the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation. for this reason, two professional observatories, teide observatory on the island of tenerife and roque de los muchachos observatory on the island of la palma, have been built on the islands.
in 1927, the province of canary islands was split into two provinces. the autonomous community of the canary islands was established in 1982. its capital is shared by the cities of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria, which in turn are the capitals of the provinces of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas. las palmas de gran canaria has been the largest city in the canaries since 1768, except for a brief period in the 1910s. between the 1833 territorial division of spain and 1927 santa cruz de tenerife was the sole capital of the canary islands. in 1927 a decree ordered that the capital of the canary islands be shared, as it remains at present. the third largest city of the canary islands is san cristóbal de la laguna (a world heritage site) on tenerife. this city is also home to the "consejo consultivo de canarias", which is the supreme consultative body of the canary islands.
during the time of the spanish empire, the canaries were the main stopover for spanish galleons on their way to the americas, which came south to catch the prevailing northeasterly trade winds.
the name "islas canarias" is likely derived from the latin name "canariae insulae", meaning "islands of the dogs", a name that was applied only to gran canaria. according to the historian pliny the elder, the mauretanian king juba ii named the island "canaria" because it contained "vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".
alternatively, it is said that the original inhabitants of the island, guanches, used to worship dogs, mummified them and treated dogs generally as holy animals. the ancient greeks also knew about a people, living far to the west, who are the "dog-headed ones", who worshipped dogs on an island. some hypothesize that the canary islands dog-worship and the ancient egyptian cult of the dog-headed god, anubis are closely connected but there is no explanation given as to which one was first.
other theories speculate that the name comes from the nukkari berber tribe living in the moroccan atlas, named in roman sources as "canarii", though pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.
the connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms.
it is considered that the aborigines of gran canaria called themselves "canarios". it is possible that after being conquered, this name was used in plural in spanish, i.e., as to refer to all of the islands as the canarii-as.
what is certain is that the name of the islands does not derive from the canary bird; rather, the birds are named after the islands.
tenerife is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago. gran canaria, with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the canary islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in spain after majorca and tenerife. the island of fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located from the african coast.
the islands form the macaronesia ecoregion with the azores, cape verde, madeira, and the savage isles. the canary islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the macaronesia region. the archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.
according to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east trade winds, the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. several native species form laurisilva forests.
as a consequence, the individual islands in the canary archipelago tend to have distinct microclimates. those islands such as el hierro, la palma and la gomera lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist canary current. they are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. as one travels east toward the african coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. fuerteventura and lanzarote, the islands which are closest to the african mainland, are effectively desert or semi desert. gran canaria is known as a "continent in miniature" for its diverse landscapes like maspalomas and roque nublo. in terms of its climate tenerife is particularly interesting. the north of the island lies under the influence of the moist atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of playa de las americas and los cristianos is arid. the island rises to almost above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine "pinus canariensis" thrive. many of the plant species in the canary islands, like the canary island pine and the dragon tree, "dracaena draco" are endemic, as noted by sabin berthelot and philip barker webb in their epic work, "l'histoire naturelle des îles canaries" (1835–50).
the climate is subtropical and desertic, moderated by the sea and in summer by the trade winds. there are a number of microclimates and the classifications range mainly from semi-arid to desert. according to the köppen climate classification, the majority of the canary islands have a hot desert climate represented as bwh. there also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean in the middle of the islands of la gomera, tenerife and la palma; where the laurisilva forests grow.
the seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets were originally volcanic islands, formed by the canary hotspot. the canary islands is the only place in spain where volcanic eruptions have been recorded during the modern era, with some volcanoes still active (el hierro, 2011).
volcanic islands such as those in the canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and landslides.
the teide volcano on tenerife is the highest mountain in spain, and the third tallest volcano on earth on a volcanic ocean island. all the islands except la gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (lanzarote, tenerife, la palma and el hierro) have historical records of eruptions since european discovery. the islands rise from jurassic oceanic crust associated with the opening of the atlantic. underwater magmatism commenced during the cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the miocene. the islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the atlas mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger african alpine system division.
in the summer of 2011 a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath el hierro. these had a linear trend of northeast-southwest. in october a submarine eruption occurred about south of restinga. this eruption produced gases and pumice, but no explosive activity was reported.
the following table shows the highest mountains in each of the islands:
the official natural symbols associated with canary islands are the bird "serinus canaria" (canary) and the "phoenix canariensis" palm.
four of spain's thirteen national parks are located in the canary islands, more than any other autonomous community. teide national park is the most visited in spain, and the oldest and largest within the canary islands. the parks are:
the canary islands have four national parks, of which two have been declared world heritage site by unesco, and the other two declared a world biosphere reserve, these national parks are:
the islands have 13 seats in the spanish senate. of these, 11 seats are directly elected, 3 for gran canaria, 3 for tenerife, 1 for each other island; 2 seats are indirectly elected by the regional autonomous government. the local government is presided over by fernando clavijo, the current president of the canary islands.
the autonomous community of the canary islands consists of two provinces ("provincias"), las palmas and santa cruz de tenerife, whose capitals (las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife) are capitals of the autonomous community. each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named "cabildo insular". each island is subdivided into smaller municipalities ("municipios"); las palmas is divided into 34 municipalities, and santa cruz de tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities.
the international boundary of the canaries is the subject of dispute between spain and morocco. morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the canaries, since the canary islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy. in fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the spanish regions is considered an autonomous community with equal status to the european ones.
the boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources. morocco and spain have been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary, since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary. in 2002, for example, morocco rejected a unilateral spanish proposal.
there are some pro-independence political parties, like the national congress of the canaries (cnc) and the popular front of the canary islands, but these parties are non-violent, and their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the "cabildos insulares".
according to "centro de investigaciones sociológicas" (sociological research center) in 2010, 43.5% of the population of the canary islands feels more canarian than spanish (37.6%), of which 7.6% only canarian, compared to 5.4% that feels more spanish than canarian (2.4%) or only spanish (3%). the most popular choice was of those who feel equally spanish and canarian, with 49.9%. with these data, one of the canary recorded levels of identification with higher autonomy from spain.
before the arrival of humans, the canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals; for example, the giant lizard ("gallotia goliath"), the tenerife and gran canaria giant rats, and giant prehistoric tortoises, "geochelone burchardi" and "geochelone vulcanica".
the islands may have been visited by the phoenicians, the greeks, and the carthaginians. king juba ii, caesar augustus's numidian protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the western world. according to pliny the elder, juba found the islands uninhabited, but found "a small temple of stone" and "some traces of buildings". juba dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at mogador in what is now western morocco in the early first century ad. that same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the canary islands, using mogador as their mission base.
when the europeans began to explore the islands in the late middle ages, they encountered several indigenous peoples living at a neolithic level of technology. although the prehistory of the settlement of the canary islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the berbers on the nearby north african coast. the precolonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the guanches, although "guanches" had been the name for only the indigenous inhabitants of tenerife. from the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from majorca, portugal and genoa. lancelotto malocello settled on lanzarote in 1312. the majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.
in 1402, the castilian conquest of the islands began, with the expedition of the french explorers jean de béthencourt and gadifer de la salle, nobles and vassals of henry iii of castile, to lanzarote. from there, they went on to conquer fuerteventura (1405) and el hierro. béthencourt received the title king of the canary islands, but still recognised king henry iii as his overlord. it was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the crown against the nobility.
historians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the canary islands:
aristocratic conquest ("conquista señorial"). this refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the crown of castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the crown. one can identify within this period an early phase known as the betancurian or norman conquest, carried out by jean de bethencourt (who was originally from normandy) and gadifer de la salle between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of lanzarote, el hierro and fuerteventura. the subsequent phase is known as the castilian conquest, carried out by castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of la gomera around 1450.
royal conquest ("conquista realenga"). this defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the crown of castile, during the reign of the catholic monarchs, who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: gran canaria, la palma and tenerife. this phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of tenerife, bringing the entire canarian archipelago under the control of the crown of castile.
béthencourt also established a base on the island of la gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. the natives of la gomera, and of gran canaria, tenerife, and la palma, resisted the castilian invaders for almost a century. in 1448 maciot de béthencourt sold the lordship of lanzarote to portugal's prince henry the navigator, an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the castilians. despite pope nicholas v ruling that the canary islands were under portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the portuguese. in 1479, portugal and castile signed the treaty of alcáçovas, which settled disputes between castile and portugal over the control of the atlantic. this treaty recognized castilian control of the canary islands but also confirmed portuguese possession of the azores, madeira, and the cape verde islands, and gave the portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the atlantic that might be discovered.
the castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when tenerife and la palma were finally subdued by alonso fernández de lugo. after that, the canaries were incorporated into the kingdom of castile.
after the conquest, the castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first sugarcane; then wine, an important item of trade with england. in this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. gran canaria, a colony of the crown of castile since 6 march 1480 (from 1556, of spain), and tenerife, a spanish colony since 1495, each had its own governor.
the cities of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria became a stopping point for the spanish conquistadors, traders, and missionaries on their way to the new world. this trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. the islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over europe. magnificent palaces and churches were built on la palma during this busy, prosperous period. the church of el salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century.
the canaries' wealth invited attacks by pirates and privateers. ottoman turkish admiral and privateer kemal reis ventured into the canaries in 1501, while murat reis the elder captured lanzarote in 1585.
the most severe attack took place in 1599, during the dutch revolt. a dutch fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by pieter van der does, attacked the capital las palmas de gran canaria (the city had 3,500 of gran canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). the dutch attacked the castillo de la luz, which guarded the harbor. the canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the castillo surrendered (but not the city). the dutch moved inland, but canarian cavalry drove them back to tamaraceite, near the city.
the dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. they received 12 sheep and 3 calves. furious, the dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the council of the canaries, who were sheltering in the village of santa brígida. 300 canarian soldiers ambushed the dutch in the village of monte lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. the dutch concentrated on las palmas de gran canaria, attempting to burn it down. the dutch pillaged maspalomas, on the southern coast of gran canaria, san sebastián on la gomera, and santa cruz on la palma, but eventually gave up the siege of las palmas and withdrew.
in 1618 the barbary pirates attacked lanzarote and la gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as slaves. another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when santa cruz de tenerife was attacked by a british fleet under horatio nelson on 25 july. the british were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. it was during this battle that nelson lost his right arm.
the sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from spain's caribbean colonies. low prices in the sugar market in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. a new cash crop, cochineal ("cochinilla"), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy. during this time the canarian-american trade was developed, in which canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum are sold in american ports, such as veracruz, campeche, la guaira and havana among others.
by the end of the 18th century, canary islanders had already emigrated to spanish american territories, such as havana, veracruz, santo domingo, san antonio, texas and st. bernard parish, louisiana. these economic difficulties spurred mass emigration, primarily to the americas, during the 19th and first half of the 20th century. between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 canary islanders emigrated to venezuela. also, thousands of canarians moved to puerto rico where the spanish monarchy felt that canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of spain. deeply entrenched traditions, such as the mascaras festival in the town of hatillo, puerto rico, are an example of canarian culture still preserved in puerto rico. similarly, many thousands of canarians emigrated to the shores of cuba. during the spanish–american war of 1898, the spanish fortified the islands against a possible american attack, but no such event took place.
sirera and renn (2004) distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term "the romantic period":
first are "expeditions financed by the states, closely related with the official scientific institutions. characterised by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of illustration and progress". in this type of expedition, sirera and renn include the following travellers:
the second type of expedition identified by sirera and renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. among these, the key exponents were the following:
sirera and renn identify the period 1770–1830 as one in which "in a panorama dominated until that moment by france and england enters with strength and brio germany of the romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase".
at the beginning of the 20th century, the british introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as fyffes.
the rivalry between the elites of the cities of las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the archipelago into two provinces in 1927. this has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.
during the time of the second spanish republic, marxist and anarchist workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as jose miguel perez and guillermo ascanio. however, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to nationalist forces during the spanish civil war.
in 1936, francisco franco was appointed general commandant of the canaries. he joined the military revolt of 17 july which began the spanish civil war. franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on la palma and in the town of vallehermoso, on la gomera. though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the canaries was most severe.
during the second world war, winston churchill prepared plans for the british seizure of the canary islands as a naval base, in the event of gibraltar being invaded from the spanish mainland.
opposition to franco's regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the communist party of spain and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.
after the death of franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in algeria, the movement for the independence and self-determination of the canaries archipelago (maiac). in 1968, the organisation of african unity recognized the maiac as a legitimate african independence movement, and declared the canary islands as an african territory still under foreign rule.
after the establishment of a democratic constitutional monarchy in spain, autonomy was granted to the canaries via a law passed in 1982, with a newly established autonomous devolved government and parliament. in 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. the spanish socialist workers' party (psoe) won. in the 2007 elections, the psoe gained a plurality of seats, but the nationalist canarian coalition and the conservative partido popular (pp) formed a ruling coalition government.
at present, the canary islands is the only autonomous community in spain that has two capitals: santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria, since the statute of autonomy of the canary islands was created in 1982.
the political capital of the archipelago does not exist as such until the nineteenth century. the first cities founded by the europeans at the time of the conquest of the canary islands in the 15th century were: telde (in gran canaria), san marcial del rubicón (in lanzarote) and betancuria (in fuerteventura). these cities boasted the first european institutions present in the archipelago, including catholic bishoprics. although, because the period of splendor of these cities developed before the total conquest of the archipelago and its incorporation into the crown of castile never had a political and real control of the entire canary archipelago.
the function of a canarian city with full jurisdiction for the entire archipelago only exists after the conquest of the canary islands, although originally "de facto", that is, without legal and real meaning and linked to the headquarters of the canary islands general captaincy.
las palmas de gran canaria was the first city that exercised this function. this is because the residence of the captain general of the canary islands was in this city during part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. in may 1661, the captain general of the canary islands, jerónimo de benavente y quiñones, moved the headquarters of the captaincy to the city of san cristóbal de la laguna on the island of tenerife. this was due to the fact that this island since the conquest was the most populated, productive and with the highest economic expectations. la laguna would be considered the "de facto" capital of the archipelago until mid the official status of the capital of canary islands in the city of santa cruz de tenerife was confirmed in the 19th century, due in part to the constant controversies and rivalries between the bourgeoisies of san cristóbal de la laguna and las palmas de gran canaria for the economic, political and institutional hegemony of the archipelago.
already in 1723 the captain general of the canary islands lorenzo fernandez de villavicencio had moved the headquarters of the general captaincy of the canary islands from san cristóbal de la laguna to santa cruz de tenerife. this decision continued without pleasing the society of the island of gran canaria. it would be after the creation of the province of canary islands in november 1833 in which santa cruz would become the first fully official capital of the canary islands ("de jure" and not of "de facto" as happened previously). santa cruz de tenerife would be the capital of the canary archipelago until during the government of general primo de rivera in 1927 the province of canary islands was split in two provinces: las palmas with capital in las palmas de gran canaria, and santa cruz de tenerife with capital in the homonymous city.
finally, with the statute of autonomy of the canary islands in 1982 and the creation of the autonomous community of the canary islands, the capital of the archipelago between las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife is fixed, which is how it remains today.
the canary islands have a population of 2,127,685 inhabitants (2018), making it the eighth most populous of spain's autonomous communities, with a density of 282.6 inhabitants per square kilometre. the total area of the archipelago is .
the canarian population includes long-tenured residents and new waves of mainland spanish immigrants, as well as moroccan, colombian, venezuelan and italian. of the total canarian population in 2009 (2,098,593) 1,799,373 were spanish and 299,220 foreigners. of these, the majority from the americas, mainly colombians (34,210), venezuelans (31,468), cubans (11,098) and dominicans (10,159). there are also 51,136 african residents, mostly moroccans (39,847).
the population of the islands according to the 2018 data are:
the roman catholic branch of christianity has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the conquest of the canary islands. there are also several other religious communities.
the overwhelming majority of native canarians are roman catholic (85%) with various smaller foreign-born populations of other christian beliefs such as protestants from northern europe.
the appearance of the virgin of candelaria (patron of canary islands) was credited with moving the canary islands toward christianity. two catholic saints were born in the canary islands: peter of saint joseph de betancur and josé de anchieta. both born on the island of tenerife, they were respectively missionaries in guatemala and brazil.
the canary islands are divided into two catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:
separate from the overwhelming christian majority are a minority of muslims. among the followers of islam, the islamic federation of the canary islands exists to represent the islamic community in the canary islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the islamic community.
other religious faiths represented include jehovah's witnesses, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints as well as hinduism. minority religions are also present such as the church of the guanche people which is classified as a neo-pagan native religion. also present are buddhism, judaism, baha'i, afro-american religion, and chinese religions.
the distribution of beliefs in 2012 according to the cis barometer autonomy was as follows:
ordered from west to east, the canary islands are el hierro, la palma, la gomera, tenerife, gran canaria, fuerteventura and lanzarote. in addition, north of the latter are the island of la graciosa, the islets of montaña clara, alegranza, roque del este and roque del oeste, belonging to the chinijo archipelago, and northeast of fuerteventura is the islet of lobos. there are also a series of small adjacent rocks in the canary islands: the roques de anaga, garachico and fasnia in tenerife, and those of salmor and bonanza in el hierro.
el hierro, the westernmost island, covers , making it the smallest of the major islands, and the least populous with 10,798 inhabitants. the whole island was declared reserve of the biosphere in 2000. its capital is valverde. also known as ferro, it was once believed to be the westernmost land in the world.
fuerteventura, with a surface of , is the second-most extensive island of the archipelago. it has been declared a biosphere reserve by unesco. it has a population of 113,275. being also the most ancient of the islands, it is the one that is more eroded: its highest point is the peak of the bramble, at a height of . its capital is puerto del rosario.
gran canaria has 846,717 inhabitants. the capital, las palmas de gran canaria (377,203 inhabitants), is the most populous city and shares the status of capital of the canaries with santa cruz de tenerife. gran canaria's surface area is . in center of the island lie the roque nublo and pico de las nieves ("peak of snow") . in the south of island are the maspalomas dunes (gran canaria), these are the biggest tourist attractions.
la gomera has an area of and is the second least populous island with 21,136 inhabitants. geologically it is one of the oldest of the archipelago. the insular capital is san sebastian de la gomera. garajonay's national park is located on the island.
lanzarote is the easternmost island and one of the most ancient of the archipelago, and it has shown evidence of recent volcanic activity. it has a surface of , and a population of 149,183 inhabitants, including the adjacent islets of the chinijo archipelago. the capital is arrecife, with 56,834 inhabitants.
the chinijo archipelago includes the islands la graciosa, alegranza, montaña clara, roque del este and roque del oeste. it has a surface of , and a population of 658 inhabitants all of them on la graciosa. with , la graciosa, is the smallest inhabited island of the canaries, and the major island of the chinijo archipelago.
la palma, with 81,863 inhabitants covering an area of , is in its entirety a biosphere reserve. it shows no recent signs of volcanic activity, even though the volcano teneguía entered into eruption last in 1971. in addition, it is the second-highest island of the canaries, with the roque de los muchachos as highest point. santa cruz de la palma (known to those on the island as simply "santa cruz") is its capital.
tenerife is, with its area of , the most extensive island of the canary islands. in addition, with 904,713 inhabitants it is the most populated island of the archipelago and spain. two of the islands' principal cities are located on it: the capital, santa cruz de tenerife and san cristóbal de la laguna (a world heritage site). san cristóbal de la laguna, the second city of the island is home to the oldest university in the canary islands, the university of la laguna. the teide, with its is the highest peak of spain and also a world heritage site. tenerife is the site of the worst air disaster in the history of aviation, in which 583 people were killed in the collision of two boeing 747s on 27 march 1977.
the economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the gdp. the canaries receive about 12 million tourists per year. construction makes up nearly 20% of the gdp and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to europe and the americas. ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more arid islands, are being overexploited but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches and almonds.
the economy is € 25 billion (2001 gdp figures). the islands experienced continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. this growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of foreign direct investment, mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and european funds (near €11 billion euro in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the canary islands are labelled region objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds). additionally, the eu allows the canary islands government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the zona especial canaria (zec) regime and create more than five jobs.
spain gave permission in august 2014 for repsol and its partners to explore oil and gas prospects off the canary islands, involving an investment of €7.5 billion over four years, to commence at the end of 2016. repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, which would meet 10 percent of spain's energy needs. however, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.
the canary islands have great natural attractions, climate and beaches make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12 million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of britons, 22% of spanish, not residents of the canaries, and 21% of germans). among the islands, tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by gran canaria and lanzarote. the archipelago's principal tourist attraction is the teide national park (in tenerife) where the highest mountain in spain and third largest volcano in the world (mount teide), receives over 2.8 million visitors annually.
the combination of high mountains, proximity to europe, and clean air has made the roque de los muchachos peak (on la palma island) a leading location for telescopes like the grantecan.
the islands, as an autonomous region of spain, are in the european union and the schengen area. they are in the european union customs union but outside the vat area, instead of vat there is a local sales tax (igic) which has a general rate of 7%, an increased tax rate of 13.5%, a reduced tax rate of 3% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services. consequently, some products are subject to additional vat if being exported from the islands into mainland spain or the rest of the eu.
canarian time is western european time (wet) (or gmt; in summer one hour ahead of gmt). so canarian time is one hour behind that of mainland spain and the same as that of the uk, ireland and mainland portugal all year round.
in 2017, 15,976,000 tourists visited the canary islands. the statistics per destination island were:
the canary islands have eight airports altogether, two of the main ports of spain, and an extensive network of autopistas (highways) and other roads. for a road map see multimap.
there are large ferry boats that link islands as well as fast ferries linking most of the islands. both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of ) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some ). a typical ferry ride between la palma and tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about two and a half hours and between tenerife and gran canaria can be about one hour.
the largest airport is the gran canaria airport. tenerife has two airports, tenerife north airport and tenerife south airport. the island of tenerife gathers the highest passenger movement of all the canary islands through its two airports. the two main islands (tenerife and gran canaria) receive the greatest number of passengers. tenerife 6,204,499 passengers and gran canaria 5,011,176 passengers.
the port of las palmas is first in freight traffic in the islands, while the port of santa cruz de tenerife is the first fishing port with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the spanish government publication statistical yearbook of state ports. similarly, it is the second port in spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the port of algeciras bay. the port's facilities include a border inspection post (bip) approved by the european union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from third countries or exports to countries outside the european economic area. the port of los cristianos (tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the canary islands, followed by the port of santa cruz de tenerife. the port of las palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.
the ss america was beached at the canary islands, in the nineties. however, the ocean liner broke apart after the course of several years and eventually sank beneath the surface.
the tenerife tram opened in 2007 and the only one in the canary islands, travelling between the cities of santa cruz de tenerife and san cristóbal de la laguna. it is currently planned to have three lines in the canary islands (two in tenerife and one in gran canaria). the planned tren de gran canaria railway line will be from las palmas de gran canaria to maspalomas (south). for its part, the tenerife railway line will link the tourist town of los cristianos with santa cruz de tenerife (tren del sur) on the one hand, and the los realejos line with santa cruz on the other (tren del norte).
the "servicio canario de salud" is an autonomous body of administrative nature attached to the ministry responsible for health of the government of the canary islands. the majority of the archipelago's hospitals belong to this organization:
before the arrival of the aborigines, the canary islands was inhabited by endemic animals, such as some extinct; giant lizards ("gallotia goliath"), giant rats ("canariomys bravoi" and "canariomys tamarani") and giant tortoises ("geochelone burchardi" and "geochelone vulcanica"), among others.
with a range of habitats, the canary islands exhibit diverse plant species. the bird life includes european and african species, such as the black-bellied sandgrouse; and a rich variety of endemic (local) taxa including the:
terrestrial fauna includes geckos, wall lizards, and three endemic species of recently rediscovered and critically endangered giant lizard: the el hierro giant lizard (or roque chico de salmor giant lizard), la gomera giant lizard, and la palma giant lizard. mammals include the canarian shrew, canary big-eared bat, the algerian hedgehog (which may have been introduced) and the more recently introduced mouflon. some endemic mammals, the lava mouse, tenerife giant rat and gran canaria giant rat, are extinct, as are the canary islands quail, long-legged bunting, the eastern canary islands chiffchaff and the giant prehistoric tortoises; geochelone burchardi and geochelone vulcanica.
the marine life found in the canary islands is also varied, being a combination of north atlantic, mediterranean and endemic species. in recent years, the increasing popularity of both scuba diving and underwater photography have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.
fish species found in the islands include many species of shark, ray, moray eel, bream, jack, grunt, scorpionfish, triggerfish, grouper, goby, and blenny. in addition, there are many invertebrate species, including sponge, jellyfish, anemone, crab, mollusc, sea urchin, starfish, sea cucumber and coral.
there are a total of five different species of marine turtle that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the endangered loggerhead sea turtle. the other four are the green sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle and kemp's ridley sea turtle. currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually migrating. however, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.
marine mammals include the large varieties of cetaceans including rare and not well-known species (see more details in the "marine life of the canary islands"). hooded seals have also been known to be vagrant in the canary islands every now and then. the canary islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest pinniped in the world, the mediterranean monk seal.
some holidays of those celebrated in the canary islands are international and national, others are regional holidays and others are of insular character. the official day of the autonomous community is canary islands day on 30 may. the anniversary of the first session of the parliament of the canary islands, based in the city of santa cruz de tenerife, held on 30 may 1983, is commemorated with this day.
the common festive calendar throughout the canary islands is as follows:
in addition, each of the islands has an island festival in which it is a holiday only on that island in question. these are the festivities of island patrons saints of each island. organized chronologically are:
the most famous festivals of the canary islands is the carnival. it is the most famous and international festival of the archipelago. the carnival is celebrated in all the islands and all its municipalities, perhaps the two busiest are those of the two canarian capitals; the carnival of santa cruz de tenerife ("tourist festival of international interest") and the carnival of las palmas de gran canaria. it is celebrated on the streets between the months of february and march. but the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: the festival of the carneros of el hierro, the festival of the diabletes of teguise in lanzarote, los indianos de la palma, the carnival of san sebastián de la gomera and the carnival of puerto del rosario in fuerteventura.
in the 1960s, gran canaria was selected as the location for one of the 14 ground stations in the manned space flight network (msfn) to support the nasa space program. maspalomas station, located in the south of the island, took part in a number of space missions including the apollo 11 moon landings and skylab. today it continues to support satellite communications as part of the esa network.
because of the remote location, a number of astronomical observatories are located in the archipelago, including the teide observatory on tenerife, the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma, and the temisas astronomical observatory on gran canaria.
a unique form of wrestling known as canarian wrestling ("lucha canaria") has opponents stand in a special area called a "terrero" and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.
another sport is the "game of the sticks" where opponents fence with long sticks. this may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.
furthermore, there is the shepherd's jump ("salto del pastor"). this involves using a long stick to vault over an open area. this sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.
the two main football teams in the archipelago are: the cd tenerife (founded in 1912) and ud las palmas (founded in 1949). as if the 2018/2019 season, both tenerife and las palmas play in liga adelante. when in the same division, the clubs contest the canary islands derby. there are smaller clubs also playing in the mainland spanish football league system, most notably ud lanzarote and cd laguna, although no other canarian clubs have played in the top flight.
the mountainous terrain of the canary islands also caters to the growing popularity of ultra running and ultramarathons as host of annual competitive long-distance events including transvulcania on la palma, transgrancanaria on gran canaria and the half marathon des sables on fuerteventura.

carlton douglas ridenhour (born august 1, 1960), known professionally as chuck d, is an american rapper, author, and producer. as the leader of the rap group public enemy, he helped create politically and socially conscious hip hop music in the mid-1980s. "the source" ranked him at no. 12 on their list of the top 50 hip-hop lyricists of all time.
ridenhour was born in queens, new york. he began writing rhymes after the new york city blackout of 1977. after graduating from roosevelt junior-senior high school, he went to adelphi university on long island to study graphic design, where he met william drayton (flavor flav). he received a b.f.a. from adelphi in 1984 and later received an honorary doctorate from adelphi in 2013.
while at adelphi, ridenhour co-hosted hip hop radio show the "super spectrum mix hour" as chuck d on saturday nights at long island rock radio station wlir, designed flyers for local hip-hop events, and drew a cartoon called "tales of the skind" for adelphi student newspaper "the delphian".
upon hearing ridenhour's demo track "public enemy number one", fledgling producer/upcoming music-mogul rick rubin insisted on signing him to his def jam label.
their major label albums were "yo! bum rush the show" (1987), "it takes a nation of millions to hold us back" (1988), "fear of a black planet" (1990), "apocalypse 91... the enemy strikes black" (1991), "greatest misses" (1992), and "muse sick-n-hour mess age" (1994). they also released a full-length album soundtrack for the film "he got game" in 1998. ridenhour also contributed (as chuck d) to several episodes of the pbs documentary series "the blues". he has appeared as a featured artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as janet jackson, kool moe dee, the dope poet society, run–d.m.c., ice cube, boom boom satellites, rage against the machine, anthrax, john mellencamp and many others. in 1990, he appeared on "kool thing", a song by the alternative rock band sonic youth, and along with flavor flav, he sang on george clinton's song "tweakin'", which appears on his 1989 album "the cinderella theory". in 1993, he executive produced "got 'em running scared", an album by ichiban records group chief groovy loo and the chosen tribe.
in 1996, ridenhour released "autobiography of mistachuck" on mercury records. chuck d made a rare appearance at the 1998 mtv video music awards, presenting the video vanguard award to the beastie boys, whilst commending their musicianship. in november 1998, he settled out of court with christopher "the notorious b.i.g." wallace's estate over the latter's sampling of his voice in the song "ten crack commandments". the specific sampling is ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track "shut 'em down". he later described the decision to sue as "stupid."
in september 1999, he launched a multi-format "supersite" on the web site rapstation.com. a home for the vast global hip hop community, the site boasts a tv and radio station with original programming, many of hip hop's most prominent djs, celebrity interviews, free mp3 downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper coolio), downloadable ringtones by tonethis, social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living. since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of peer-to-peer file sharing in the music industry.
he loaned his voice to "" as dj forth right mc for the radio station playback fm. in 2000, he collaborated with public enemy's gary g-whiz and mc lyte on the theme music to the television show "dark angel". he appeared with henry rollins in a cover of black flag's "rise above" for the album "". he was also featured on z-trip's album "shifting gears" on a track called "shock and awe"; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by shepard fairey. in 2008 he contributed a chapter to "sound unbound: sampling digital music and culture" (the mit press, 2008) edited by paul d. miller a.k.a. dj spooky, and also turned up on the go! team's album "proof of youth" on the track "flashlight fight." he also fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game "nba ballers: chosen one" on xbox 360 and playstation 3.
in 2009, ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book "the love ethic: the reason why you can't find and keep beautiful black love" by kamau and akilah butler. he also appeared on brother ali's album, "us".
in march 2011, chuck d re-recorded vocals with the dillinger escape plan for a cover of "fight the power".
chuck d duetted with rock singer meat loaf on his 2011 album "hell in a handbasket" on the song "mad mad world/the good god is a woman and she don't like ugly".
in 2016 chuck d joined the band prophets of rage along with b-real and former members of rage against the machine.
chuck d is known for his powerful rapping voice - "how to rap" says, "chuck d of public enemy has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in hip-hop". chuck d says this was based on listening to melle mel and sportscasters such as marv albert.
chuck d often comes up with a title for a song first and that he writes on paper, though he sometimes edits using a computer. he also prefers to not punch in vocals, and he prefers to not overdub vocals.
ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted "unfiltered" on air america radio, testified before congress in support of peer-to-peer mp3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention. he has continued to be an activist, publisher, lecturer, and producer.
addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book "fight the power: rap, race, and reality" with yusuf jah. he argues that "music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality", but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when "things could lead a young mind in a direction." he also founded the record company slam jamz and acted as narrator in kareem adouard's short film "bling: consequences and repercussions", which examines the role of conflict diamonds in bling fashion. despite chuck d and public enemy's success, chuck d claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. he is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with "bomb magazine" that, "the key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. the creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in america, europe and asia. it gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals."
in an interview with "le monde" published january 29, 2008, chuck d stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master. he believes that nothing has changed for african-americans since the debut of public enemy and, although he thinks that an obama-clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. he stated that french president nicolas sarkozy is like any other european elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from africa. in this article, he defended a comment made by professor griff in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. the real statement was a critique of the israeli government and its treatment of the palestinian people. chuck d stated that it is public enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.
in an interview with the magazine "n'digo" published in june 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. however, he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying "it's only going to be dead if it doesn't talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement", citing artists such as nyoil, m.i.a. and the roots as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. "a lot of cats are out there doing it, on the web and all over. they're just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation."
in 2010, chuck d released a track, "tear down that wall". he said, "i talked about the wall not only just dividing the u.s. and mexico but the states of california, new mexico and texas. but arizona, it's like, come on. now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling."
he is on the board of the transafrica forum, a pan african organization that is focused on african, caribbean and latin american issues.
he is a pescetarian.

in film and video, a cutaway shot is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else. it is usually followed by a cut back to the first shot, when the cutaway avoids a jump cut. the cutaway shot does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the editor assemble a longer sequence. for this reason, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location. for example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead.
similarly, a cutaway scene is the interruption of a scene with the insertion of another scene, generally unrelated or only peripherally related to the original scene. the interruption is usually quick, and is usually, although not always, ended by a return to the original scene. the effect is of commentary to the original scene, frequently comic in nature.
the most common use of cutaway shots in dramatic films is to adjust the pace of the main action, to conceal the deletion of some unwanted part of the main shot, or to allow the joining of parts of two versions of that shot. for example, a scene may be improved by cutting a few frames out of an actor's pause; a brief view of a listener can help conceal the break. or the actor may fumble some of his lines in a group shot; rather than discarding a good version of the shot, the director may just have the actor repeat the lines for a new shot, and cut to that alternate view when necessary.
cutaways are also used often in older horror films in place of special effects. for example, a shot of a zombie getting its head cut off may, for instance, start with a view of an axe being swung through the air, followed by a close-up of the actor swinging it, then followed by a cut back to the now severed head. george a. romero, creator of the dead series, and tom savini pioneered effects that removed the need for cutaways in horror films. 30 rock would often use cutaway scenes to create visual humor, the werewolf bar mitzvah scene taking three days to create for only five seconds of screen time. the animated television show "family guy" often uses cutaway gags as humor.
in news broadcasting and documentary work, the cutaway is used much as it would be in fiction. on location, there is usually just one camera to film an interview, and it's usually trained on the interviewee. often there is also only one microphone. after the interview, the interviewer will usually repeat his questions while he himself is being filmed, with pauses as they act as if to listen to the answers. these shots can be used as cutaways. cutaways to the interviewer, called noddies, can also be used to cover cuts.

a coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound; lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle; and does not initiate voluntary actions. coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. comas can be derived by natural causes, or can be medically induced.
clinically, a coma can be defined as the inability to consistently follow a one-step command. it can also be defined as a score of ≤ 8 on the glasgow coma scale (gcs) lasting ≥ 6 hours. for a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of "wakefulness" and "awareness" must be maintained. wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness, whereas awareness relates to the qualitative aspects of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. from a neurological perspective, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex—the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain and by the reticular activating system (ras), a structure located within the brainstem.
the term ‘coma’, from the greek "koma", meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the hippocratic corpus ("epidemica") and later by galen (second century ad). subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. the term is found again in thomas willis’ (1621–1675) influential "de anima brutorum" (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), ‘coma’ (heavy sleeping), "carus" (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which "carus" could turn and which he localized in the white matter) are mentioned. the term "carus" is also derived from greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. it can still be found in the root of the term ‘carotid’. thomas sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term ‘coma’ in several cases of fever (sydenham, 1685).
general symptoms of a person in a comatose state are:
many types of problems can cause coma. some examples are:
forty percent of comatose states result from drug poisoning. drugs damage or weaken the synaptic functioning in the ascending reticular activating system (aras) and keep the system from properly functioning to arouse the brain. secondary effects of drugs, which include abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, as well as abnormal breathing and sweating, may also indirectly harm the functioning of the aras and lead to a coma. given that drug poisoning is the cause for a large portion of patients in a coma, hospitals first test all comatose patients by observing pupil size and eye movement, through the vestibular-ocular reflex. (see "diagnosis" below).
the second most common cause of coma, which makes up about 25% of comatose patients, is lack of oxygen, generally resulting from cardiac arrest. the central nervous system (cns) requires a great deal of oxygen for its neurons. oxygen deprivation in the brain, also known as hypoxia, causes sodium and calcium from outside of the neurons to decrease and intracellular calcium to increase, which harms neuron communication. lack of oxygen in the brain also causes atp exhaustion and cellular breakdown from cytoskeleton damage and nitric oxide production.
twenty percent of comatose states result from the side effects of a stroke. during a stroke, blood flow to part of the brain is restricted or blocked. an ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or tumor may cause restriction of blood flow. lack of blood to cells in the brain prevent oxygen from getting to the neurons, and consequently causes cells to become disrupted and die. as brain cells die, brain tissue continues to deteriorate, which may affect the functioning of the aras.
the remaining 15% of comatose cases result from trauma, excessive blood loss, malnutrition, hypothermia, hyperthermia, abnormal glucose levels, and many other biological disorders.
injury to either or both of the cerebral cortex or the reticular activating system (ras) is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma.
the cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain, in humans and other mammals. the cerebral cortex is composed of gray matter which consists of the nuclei of neurons, whereas the inner portion of the cerebrum is composed of white matter and is composed of the axons of neurons. white matter is responsible for perception, relay of the sensory input via the thalamic pathway, and many other neurological functions, including complex thinking. the ras, on the other hand, is a more primitive structure in the brainstem which includes the reticular formation (rf). the ras has two tracts, the ascending and descending tract. the ascending track, or ascending reticular activating system (aras), is made up of a system of acetylcholine-producing neurons, and works to arouse and wake up the brain. arousal of the brain begins from the rf, through the thalamus, and then finally to the cerebral cortex. a failure in aras functioning may thus lead to a coma.
the severity and mode of onset of coma depends on the underlying cause. for instance, severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood) initially cause mild agitation and confusion, but progress to obtundation, stupor, and finally, complete unconsciousness. in contrast, coma resulting from a severe traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage can be instantaneous. the mode of onset may therefore be indicative of the underlying cause.
although diagnosis of coma is simple, investigating the underlying cause of onset can be rather challenging. as such, after gaining stabilization of the patient's airways, breathing and circulation (the basic abcs) various diagnostic tests, such as physical examinations and imaging tools (cat scan, mri, etc.) are employed to access the underlying cause of the coma.
when an unconscious patient enters a hospital, the hospital utilizes a series of diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. according to young, the following steps should be taken when dealing with a patient possibly in a coma:
in the initial assessment of coma, it is common to gauge the level of consciousness on the avpu (alert, vocal stimuli, painful stimuli, unresponsive) scale by spontaneously exhibiting actions and, assessing the patient's response to vocal and painful stimuli. more elaborate scales, such as the glasgow coma scale, quantify an individual's reactions such as eye opening, movement and verbal response in order to indicate their extent of brain injury. the patient's score can vary from a score of 3 (indicating severe brain injury and death) to 15 (indicating mild or no brain injury).
in those with deep unconsciousness, there is a risk of asphyxiation as the control over the muscles in the face and throat is diminished. as a result, those presenting to a hospital with coma are typically assessed for this risk ("airway management"). if the risk of asphyxiation is deemed high, doctors may use various devices (such as an oropharyngeal airway, nasopharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube) to safeguard the airway.
imaging basically encompasses computed tomography (cat or ct) scan of the brain, or mri for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as hemorrhage in the brain or herniation of the brain structures. special tests such as an eeg can also show a lot about the activity level of the cortex such as semantic processing, presence of seizures, and are important available tools not only for the assessment of the cortical activity but also for predicting the likelihood of the patient's awakening. the autonomous responses such as the skin conductance response may also provide further insight on the patient's emotional processing.
physical examination is critical after stabilization. it should include the assessment and observation of the patient's...
assessment of the brainstem and cortical function through special reflex tests such as the oculocephalic reflex test (doll's eyes test), oculovestibular reflex test (cold caloric test), corneal reflex, and the gag reflex. reflexes are a good indicator of what cranial nerves are still intact and functioning and is an important part of the physical exam. due to the unconscious status of the patient, only a limited number of the nerves can be assessed. these include the cranial nerves number 2 (cn ii), number 3 (cn iii), number 5 (cn v), number 7 (cn vii), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (cn ix, cn x).
assessment of posture and physique is the next step. it involves general observation about the patient's positioning. there are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. decorticate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms flexed at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs extended. decerebrate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). the posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. a decorticate posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) at or above the red nucleus, whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. in other words, a decorticate lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate posturing which indicates that the lesion is closer to the brainstem.
pupil assessment is often a critical portion of a comatose examination, as it can give information as to the cause of the coma; the following table is a technical, medical guideline for common pupil findings and their possible interpretations:
a coma can be classified as (1) supratentorial (above tentorium cerebelli), (2) infratentorial (below tentorium cerebelli), (3) metabolic or (4) diffused. this classification is merely dependent on the position of the original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis. the severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. patients may or may not progress through these levels. in the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.
the rancho los amigos scale is a complex scale that has eight separate levels, and is often used in the first few weeks or months of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.
treatment for coma patients will depend on the severity and cause of the comatose state.
upon admittance to an emergency department, coma patients will usually be placed in an intensive care unit (icu) immediately, where maintenance of the patient's respiration and circulation become a first priority. stability of their respiration and circulation is sustained through the use of intubation, ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood and other supportive care as needed.
once a patient is stable and no longer in immediate danger, there may be a shift of priority from stabilizing the patient to maintaining the state of their physical wellbeing. moving patients every 2–3 hours by turning them side to side is crucial to avoiding bed sores as a result of being confined to a bed. moving patients through the use of physical therapy also aids in preventing atelectasis, contractures or other orthopedic deformities which would interfere with a coma patient's recovery.
pneumonia is also common in coma patients due to their inability to swallow which can then lead to aspiration. a coma patient's lack of a gag reflex, and use of a feeding tube can result in food, drink or other solid organic matter being lodged within their lower respiratory tract (from the trachea to the lungs). this trapping of matter in their lower respiratory tract can ultimately lead to infection, resulting in aspiration pneumonia.
coma patients may also deal with restless, or seizures. as such, soft cloth restraints may be used to prevent them from pulling on tubes or dressings and side rails on the bed should be kept up to prevent patients from falling.
methods to wake comatose patients include reversing the cause of the coma, for example, inducing glucose shock if cause of coma was low blood sugar or giving medication to stop brain swelling if cause of coma was encephalitis or meningitis. many novel treatments for waking coma patients have been reported, such as the use of sensory stimulation therapy (vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste) or music therapy and have been shown to improve patient scores on the glasgow coma scale.
coma has a wide variety of emotional reactions from the family members of the affected patients, as well as the primary care givers taking care of the patients. common reactions, such as desperation, anger, frustration, and denial are possible. the focus of the patient care should be on creating an amicable relationship with the family members or dependents of a comatose patient as well as creating a rapport with the medical staff.
comas can last from several days to several weeks. in more severe cases a coma may last for over five weeks, while some have lasted as long as several years. after this time, some patients gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a vegetative state, and others die. some patients who have entered a vegetative state go on to regain a degree of awareness and in some cases, may remain in vegetative state for years or even decades (the longest recorded period being 42 years).
predicted chances of recovery will differ depending on which techniques were used to measure the patient's severity of neurological damage. predictions of recovery are based on statistical rates, expressed as the level of chance the person has of recovering. time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery. for example, after four months of coma caused by brain damage, the chance of partial recovery is less than 15%, and the chance of full recovery is very low.
the outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause, location, severity and extent of neurological damage. a deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery, similarly, milder comas do not ensure higher chances of recovery . the most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is secondary infection such as pneumonia, which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.
people may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. it is common for coma patients to awaken in a profound state of confusion and suffer from dysarthria, the inability to articulate any speech. recovery usually occurs gradually. in the first days, patients may only awaken for a few minutes, with increased duration of wakefulness as their recovery progresses and may eventually recover full awareness. that said, some patients may never progress beyond very basic responses.
there are reports of patients coming out of coma after long periods of time. after 19 years in a minimally conscious state, terry wallis spontaneously began speaking and regained awareness of his surroundings.
a brain-damaged man, trapped in a coma-like state for six years, was brought back to consciousness in 2003 by doctors who planted electrodes deep inside his brain. the method, called deep brain stimulation (dbs) successfully roused communication, complex movement and eating ability in the 38-year-old american man who suffered a traumatic brain injury. his injuries left him in a minimally conscious state (mcs), a condition akin to a coma but characterized by occasional, but brief, evidence of environmental and self-awareness that coma patients lack.
being that a patient in a coma is said to be in a unconscious state, perspectives on personhood, identity and consciousness come into play when discussing the metaphysical and bioethical views on comas.
it has recently been argued that unawareness should be just as ethically relevant and important as a state of awareness and that there should be metaphysical support of unawareness as a state.
in the ethical discussions about disorders of consciousness (docs), two abilities are usually considered as central: "experiencing well-being and having interests." well-being can broadly be understood as the positive effect related to what makes life good (according to specific standards) for the individual in question. the only condition for well-being broadly considered is the ability to experience its ‘positiveness’. that said, because experiencing positiveness is a basic emotional process with phylogenetic roots, it is likely to occur at a completely unaware level and therefore, introduces the idea of an unconscious well-being. as such, the ability of having interests, is crucial for describing two abilities which those with comas are deficient in. having an interest in a certain domain can be understood as having a stake in something can affect what makes our life good in that domain. an interest is what directly and immediately improves life from a certain point of view or within a particular domain, or greatly increases the likelihood of life improvement enabling the subject to realize some good. that said, sensitivity to reward signals is a fundamental element in the learning process, both consciously and unconsciously. moreover, the unconscious brain is able to interact with its surroundings in a meaningful way and to produce meaningful information processing of stimuli coming from the external environment, including other people.
according to hawkins, "1. a life is good if the subject is able to value, or more basically if the subject is able to care. importantly, hawkins stresses that caring has no need for cognitive commitment, i.e. for high-level cognitive activities: it requires being able to distinguish something, track it for a while, recognize it over time, and have certain emotional dispositions "vis-à-vis" something. 2. a life is good if the subject has the capacity for relationship with others, i.e. for meaningfully interacting with other people." this suggests that unawareness may (at least partly) fulfil both conditions identified by hawkins for life to be a good for a subject, thus making the unconscious ethically relevant.
research by dr. eelco wijdicks on the depiction of comas in movies was published in neurology in may 2006. dr. wijdicks studied 30 films (made between 1970 and 2004) that portrayed actors in prolonged comas, and he concluded that only two films accurately depicted the state of a coma victim and the agony of waiting for a patient to awaken: "reversal of fortune" (1990) and "the dreamlife of angels" (1998). the remaining 28 were criticized for portraying miraculous awakenings with no lasting side effects, unrealistic depictions of treatments and equipment required, and comatose patients remaining muscular and tanned.

call of cthulhu is a horror fiction role-playing game based on h. p. lovecraft's story of the same name and the associated cthulhu mythos. the game, often abbreviated as "coc", is published by chaosium; it was first released in 1981 and is currently in its seventh edition, with many different versions released. it makes use of chaosium's basic role-playing (brp) system, with special rules for sanity.
the setting of "call of cthulhu" is a darker version of our world, based on h. p. lovecraft's observation (from his essay, "supernatural horror in literature") that "the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown." the original game, first published in 1981, uses mechanics from basic role-playing, and is set in the 1920s, the setting of many of lovecraft's stories. additional settings were developed in the "cthulhu by gaslight" supplement, a blend of occult and holmesian mystery and mostly set in england during the 1890s, and modern/1980s conspiracy with "cthulhu now" and "delta green". more recent additions include 1000 ad ("cthulhu: dark ages"), 23rd century ("cthulhu rising") and ancient roman times ("cthulhu invictus"). the protagonists may also travel to places that are not of this earth, represented in the dreamlands (which can be accessed through dreams as well as being physically connected to the earth), to other planets, or into the voids of space. in keeping with the lovecraftian theme, the gamemaster is called the keeper of arcane lore, or simply the keeper, while player characters are called "investigators".
"coc" uses the basic role-playing system first developed for "runequest" and used in other chaosium games. it is skill-based, with player characters getting better with their skills by succeeding at using them for as long as they stay functionally healthy and sane. they do not, however, gain hit points and do not become significantly harder to kill. the game does not use levels.
"coc" uses percentile dice (with a results ranging from 1 to 100) to determine success or failure. every player statistic is intended to be compatible with the notion that there is a probability of success for a particular action given what the player is capable of doing. for example, an artist may have a 75% chance of being able to draw something (represented by having 75 in art skill), and thus rolling a number under 75 would yield a success. rolling or less of the skill level (1-15 in the example) would be a "special success" (or an "impale" for combat skills) and would yield some extra bonus to be determined by the keeper. for example, the artist character might draw especially well or especially fast, or catch some unapparent detail in the drawing.
the players take the roles of ordinary people drawn into the realm of the mysterious: detectives, criminals, scholars, artists, war veterans, etc. often, happenings begin innocently enough, until more and more of the workings behind the scenes are revealed. as the characters learn more of the true horrors of the world and the irrelevance of humanity, their sanity (represented by "sanity points", abbreviated san) inevitably withers away. the game includes a mechanism for determining how damaged a character's sanity is at any given point; encountering the horrific beings usually triggers a loss of san points. to gain the tools they need to defeat the horrors – mystic knowledge and magic – the characters may end up losing some of their sanity, though other means such as pure firepower or simply outsmarting one's opponents also exist. "coc" has a reputation as a game in which it is quite common for a player character to die in gruesome circumstances or end up in a mental institution. eventual triumph of the players is not assumed.
the original conception of "call of cthulhu" was "dark worlds", a game commissioned by the publisher chaosium but never published. sandy petersen contacted them regarding writing a supplement for their popular fantasy game "runequest" set in lovecraft's dreamlands. he took over the writing of "call of cthulhu", and the game was released in 1981.
since petersen's departure from chaosium, continuing development of "call of cthulhu" passed to lynn willis, credited as co-author in the fifth and sixth editions, and more recently to paul fricker and mike mason. the game system underwent only minor rules changes in its first six editions (between 1981 and 2011); the current seventh edition, released 2014, includes more significant rules alterations than in any previous release.
for those grounded in the rpg tradition, the very first release of "call of cthulhu" created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. rather than the traditional format established by "dungeons & dragons", which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, sandy petersen introduced the concept of the "onion skin": interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the player characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. unlike its predecessor games, "coc" assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe way to deal with the vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. a well-run "coc" campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. the style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.
the first book of "call of cthulhu" adventures was "shadows of yog-sothoth". in this work, the characters come upon a secret society's foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near to home and then in a series of exotic locations. this template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including "fungi from yuggoth" (later known as "curse of cthulhu" and "day of the beast"), "spawn of azathoth", and possibly the most highly acclaimed, "masks of nyarlathotep".
"shadows of yog-sothoth" is important not only because it represents the first published addition to the boxed first edition of "call of cthulhu", but because its format defined a new way of approaching a campaign of linked rpg scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. its format has been used by every other campaign-length "call of cthulhu" publication. the standard of "coc" scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. "the asylum and other tales", a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in issue 47 of "white dwarf" magazine.
the standard of the included 'clue' material varies from scenario to scenario, but reached its zenith in the original boxed versions of the "masks of nyarlathotep" and "horror on the orient express" campaigns. inside these one could find matchbooks and business cards apparently defaced by non-player characters, newspaper cuttings and (in the case of "orient express") period passports to which players could attach their photographs, increasing the sense of immersion. indeed, during the period that these supplements were produced, third party campaign publishers strove to emulate the quality of the additional materials, often offering separately-priced 'deluxe' clue packages for their campaigns.
additional milieux were provided by chaosium with the release of "dreamlands", a boxed supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the lovecraft dreamlands, a large map and a scenario booklet, and "cthulhu by gaslight", another boxed set which moved the action from the 1920s to the 1890s.
in 1987, chaosium issued the supplement titled "cthulhu now", a collection of rules, supplemental source materials and scenarios for playing "call of cthulhu" in the present day. this proved to be a very popular alternative milieu, so much so that much of the supplemental material is now included in the core rule book.
pagan publishing released "delta green", a series of supplements originally set in the 1990s, although later supplements add support for playing closer to the present day. in these, player characters are agents of a secret agency known as delta green, which fights against creatures from the mythos and conspiracies related to them. arc dream publishing released a new version of "delta green" in 2016 as a standalone game, partially using the mechanics from "call of cthulhu".
"lovecraft country" was a line of supplements for "call of cthulhu" released in 1990. these supplements were overseen by keith herber and provided backgrounds and adventures set in lovecraft's fictional towns of arkham, kingsport, innsmouth, dunwich, and their environs. the intent was to give investigators a common base, as well as to center the action on well-drawn characters with clear motivations.
in the years since the collapse of the "mythos" collectible card game (production ceased in 1997), the release of "coc" books has been very sporadic with up to a year between releases. chaosium struggled with near bankruptcy for many years before finally starting their upward climb again.
2005 was chaosium's busiest year for many years with ten releases for the game. chaosium took to marketing "monographs"—short books by individual writers with editing and layout provided out-of-house—directly to the consumer, allowing the company to gauge market response to possible new works. the range of times and places in which the horrors of the mythos can be encountered was also expanded in late 2005 onwards with the addition of "cthulhu dark ages" by stéphane gesbert, which gives a framework for playing games set in 11th century europe, "secrets of japan" by michael dziesinski for gaming in modern-day japan, and "secrets of kenya" by david conyers for gaming in interwar period africa.
in july 2011, chaosium announced it would re-release a 30th anniversary edition of the "coc" 6th edition role-playing game. this 320-page book features thick (3 mm) leatherette hardcovers with the front cover and spine stamped with gold foil. the interior pages are printed in black ink, on 90 gsm matte art paper. the binding is thread sewn, square backed. chaosium offered a one-time printing of this collector's edition.
on may 28, 2013, a crowdfunding campaign on kickstarter for the 7th edition of "call of cthulhu" was launched with a goal of $40,000; it ended on june 29 of the same year having collected $561,836. it included many more major revisions than any previous edition, and also split the core rules into two books, a player's guide and keeper's guide. problems and delays fulfilling the kickstarters for the 7th edition of "call of cthulhu" led greg stafford and sandy petersen (who had both left in 1998) to return to an active role at chaosium in june 2015.
chaosium has licensed other publishers to create supplements using their rule system, notably including "delta green" by pagan publishing. other licensees have included infogrames, miskatonic river press, theater of the mind enterprises, triad entertainment, games workshop, fantasy flight games, rafm, goodman games, grenadier models inc. and yog-sothoth.com. these supplements may be set in different time frames or even different game universes from the original game.
"shadow of the comet" (later repackaged as "call of cthulhu: shadow of the comet") is an adventure game developed and released by infogrames in 1993. the game is based on h. p. lovecraft's cthulhu mythos and uses many elements from lovecraft's "the dunwich horror" and "the shadow over innsmouth". a follow-up game, "prisoner of ice", is not a direct sequel.
"prisoner of ice" (also "call of cthulhu: prisoner of ice") is an adventure game developed and released by infogrames for the pc and macintosh computers in 1995 in america and europe. it is based on h. p. lovecraft's cthulhu mythos, particularly "at the mountains of madness", and is a follow-up to infogrames' earlier "shadow of the comet". in 1997, the game was ported to the sega saturn and playstation exclusively in japan.
in 2001, a stand-alone version of "call of cthulhu" was released by wizards of the coast, for the d20 system. intended to preserve the feeling of the original game, the d20 conversion of the game rules were supposed to make the game more accessible to the large "d&d" player base. the d20 system also made it possible to use "dungeons & dragons" characters in "call of cthulhu", as well as to introduce the cthulhu mythos into "dungeons & dragons" games. the d20 version of the game is no longer supported by wizards as per their contract with chaosium. chaosium included d20 stats as an appendix in three releases (see lovecraft country), but have since dropped the "dual stat" idea.
a licensed first-person shooter adventure game by headfirst productions, based on "call of cthulhu" campaign "escape from innsmouth" and released by bethesda softworks in 2005/2006 for the pc and xbox.
in february 2008, pelgrane press published "trail of cthulhu", a stand-alone game created by kenneth hite using the gumshoe system developed by robin laws. "trail of cthulhu"s system is more mystery oriented and focuses mostly on interpreting clues.
in september 2008, reality deviant publications published "shadows of cthulhu", a supplement that brings lovecraftian gaming to green ronin's true20 system.
in october 2009, reality blurs published "realms of cthulhu", a supplement for pinnacle entertainment's savage worlds system.
in 2010, cubicle 7 published an official role-playing game, "the laundry" and a number of supplements, all based on charles stross's "laundry files" series.
in april 2011, chaosium and new developer red wasp design announced a joint project to produce a mobile video game based on the "call of cthulhu" rpg, entitled "call of cthulhu: the wasted land". the game was released on january 30, 2012.
in 2018, metarcade produced "cthulhu chronicles", a game for ios with a campaign of nine mobile interactive fiction stories set in 1920s england based on "call of cthulhu". the first five stories were released on july 10, 2018.
"mythos" was a collectible card game (ccg) based on the cthulhu mythos that chaosium produced and marketed during the mid-1990s. while generally praised for its fast gameplay and unique mechanics, it ultimately failed to gain a very large market presence. it bears mention because its eventual failure brought the company to hard times that affected its ability to produce material for "call of cthulhu". "call of cthulhu: the card game" is a second collectible card game, produced by fantasy flight games.
the first licensed "call of cthulhu" gaming miniatures were sculpted by andrew chernack and released by grenadier models in boxed sets and blister packs in 1983. the license was later transferred to rafm. as of 2011, rafm still produce licensed c"all of cthulhu" models sculpted by bob murch. both lines include investigator player character models and the iconic monsters of the cthulhu mythos.
as of july 2015, reaper miniatures started its third "bones kickstarter", a kickstarter intended to help the company migrate some miniatures from metal to plastic, and introducing some new ones. among the stretch goals was the second $50 expansion, devoted to the mythos, with miniatures such as cultists, deep ones, mi'go, and an extra $15 shub-niggurath "miniature" (it is, at least, 6x4 squares). it is expected for those miniatures to remain in the reaper miniatures catalogue after the kickstarter project finishes.
call of cthulhu: the official video game is a survival horror role-playing video game developed by cyanide and published by focus home interactive for playstation 4, xbox one and windows. the game features a semi-open world environment and incorporates themes of lovecraftian and psychological horror into a story which includes elements of investigation and stealth. it is inspired by h. p. lovecraft's short story "the call of cthulhu".
william a. barton reviewed "call of cthulhu" in "the space gamer" no. 49. barton calls the game "an excellent piece of work." he noted that there were some shortcomings resulting from assumption of rules details from "runequest" that are not in "coc" itself, but praised it overall, saying "the worlds of h. p. lovecraft are truly open for the fantasy gamer., and calling the game a satisfactory experience.
david cook reviewed "call of cthulhu" for "dragon" magazine #61 (may 1982). he commented: "it is a good game for experienced role-playing gamers and ambitious judges, especially if they like lovecraft’s type of story."
lisa cohen reviewed the 1986 edition of "call of cthulhu" in "space gamer/fantasy gamer" no. 80. cohen commented that "this book can be for collectors of art, players, or anyone interested in knowledge about old time occult. it is the one reprint that is worth the money."
"call of cthulhu" was ranked 1st in the 1996 reader poll of "arcane" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. the uk magazine's editor paul pettengale commented: ""call of cthulhu" is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it's a game that doesn't age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly. the system, even though it's over ten years old, it still one of the very best you'll find in any roleplaying game. also, there's not a referee in the land who could say they've read every lovecraft inspired book or story going, so there's a pretty-well endless supply of scenario ideas. it's simply marvellous."
the game won several major awards in the following years:

constellations: an international journal of critical and democratic theory is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal of critical and democratic theory and successor of "praxis international". it is edited by jean l. cohen, amy allen, and andreas kalyvas. seyla benhabib is a co-founding former editor and nancy fraser a former co-editor. with a broad and international editorial contribution, it is based at the new school in new york.

cape breton island (—formerly '; or '; ; or simply "cape breton") is an island on the atlantic coast of north america and part of the province of nova scotia, canada.
the island accounts for 18.7% of nova scotia's total area. although the island is physically separated from the nova scotia peninsula by the strait of canso, the long rock-fill canso causeway connects it to mainland nova scotia. the island is east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western coasts fronting on the gulf of saint lawrence; its western coast also forms the eastern limits of the northumberland strait. the eastern and southern coasts front the atlantic ocean; its eastern coast also forms the western limits of the cabot strait. its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the highlands of its northern cape. one of the world's larger salt water lakes, ("arm of gold" in french), dominates the island's centre.
the island is divided into four of nova scotia's eighteen counties: cape breton, inverness, richmond, and victoria. their total population at the 2016 census numbered 132,010 "cape bretoners"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population. cape breton island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 2.9% since the 2011 census. approximately 75% of the island's population is in the cape breton regional municipality (cbrm) which includes all of cape breton county and is often referred to as industrial cape breton, given the history of coal mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was nova scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.
the island has five reserves of the mi'kmaq nation: , , , , and /chapel island. is the largest in both population and land area.
its name may derive from near bayonne, or more probably from "cape" and the word ', the french demonym for ', the french historical region. william francis ganong, however, refutes a french origin for the name and offers, instead, that the earliest form of the name appeared on portuguese maps as "bertomes", and, he argues, "that word meant at the time the english and not the french bretons, and referred to the region which john cabot and his bristol englishmen discovered on the voyage of 1497...therefore our cape breton would mean 'cape of the english'"
cape breton island's first residents were likely archaic maritime natives, ancestors of the mi'kmaq. these peoples and their progeny inhabited the island (known as unama'ki) for several thousand years and continue to live there to this day. their traditional lifestyle centred around hunting and fishing because of the unfavourable agricultural conditions of their maritime home. this ocean-centric lifestyle did, however, make them among the first indigenous peoples to discover european explorers and sailors fishing in the st lawrence estuary. john cabot reportedly visited the island in 1497. however, european histories and maps of the period are of too poor quality to be sure whether cabot first visited newfoundland or cape breton island. this discovery is commemorated by cape breton's cabot trail, and by the cabot's landing historic site & provincial park, near the village of dingwall.
the local mi'kmaq peoples began trading with european fishermen when the fishermen began landing in their territories as early as the 1520s. in about 1521–22, the portuguese under joão álvares fagundes established a fishing colony on the island. as many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now ingonish on the island's northeastern peninsula. these fishermen traded with the local population but did not maintain a permanent settlement. this portuguese colony's fate is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.
during the anglo-french war of 1627 to 1629, under charles i, the kirkes took quebec city; sir james stewart of killeith, lord ochiltree planted a colony on unama'ki at baleine, nova scotia; and alexander's son, william alexander, 1st earl of stirling, established the first incarnation of "new scotland" at port royal. these claims, and larger european ideals of native conquest were the first time the island was incorporated as european territory, though it would be several decades later that treaties would actually be signed (no copies of these treaties exist).
these scottish triumphs, which left cape sable as the only major french holding in north america, did not last. charles i's haste to make peace with france on the terms most beneficial to him meant the new north american gains would be bargained away in the treaty of saint-germain-en-laye (1632), which established which european power had claim over the territories, but did not in fact establish that europeans had any claim to begin with.
the french quickly defeated the scots at baleine, and established the first european settlements on île royale: present day englishtown (1629) and st. peter's (1630). these settlements lasted only one generation, until nicolas denys left in 1659. the island did not have any european settlers for another fifty years before those communities along with louisbourg were re-established in 1713, after which point european settlement was permanently established on the island.
known as ""île royale"" ("royal island") to the french, the island also saw active settlement by france. after the french ceded their claims to newfoundland and the acadian mainland to the british by the treaty of utrecht in 1713, the french relocated the population of plaisance, newfoundland, to île royale and the french garrison was established in the central eastern part at sainte anne. as the harbour at sainte anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to build a much larger fortification at louisbourg to improve defences at the entrance to the gulf of saint lawrence and to defend france's fishing fleet on the grand banks. the french also built the louisbourg lighthouse in 1734, the first lighthouse in canada and one of the first in north america. in addition to cape breton island, the french colony of île royale also included île saint-jean, today called prince edward island, and les îles-de-la-madeleine.
louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in new france. louisbourg was captured by new englanders with british naval assistance in 1745 and by british forces in 1758. the french population of île royale was deported to france after each siege. while french settlers returned to their homes in île royale after the treaty of aix-la-chapelle was signed in 1748, the fortress was demolished after the second siege. île royale remained formally part of new france until it was ceded to great britain by the treaty of paris in 1763. it was then merged with the adjacent, british colony of nova scotia (present day peninsular nova scotia and new brunswick). acadians who had been expelled from nova scotia and île royale were permitted to settle in cape breton beginning in 1764, and established communities in north-western cape breton, near cheticamp, and southern cape breton, on and near isle madame.
some of the first british-sanctioned settlers on the island following the seven years' war were irish, although upon settlement they merged with local french communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition. from 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of nova scotia and was governed from halifax.
the first permanently settled scottish community on cape breton island was judique, settled in 1775 by michael mor macdonald. he spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's community centre. he composed a song about the area called "o 's àlainn an t-àite", or "o, fair is the place."
during the american revolution, on 1 november 1776, john paul jones – the father of the american navy – set sail in command of "alfred" to free hundreds of american prisoners working in the area's coal mines. although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of "mellish", a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for john burgoyne's troops in canada.
major timothy hierlihy and his regiment on board hms "hope" worked in and protected from privateer attacks on the coal mines at sydney cape breton. sydney cape breton provided a vital supply of coal for halifax throughout the war. the british began developing the mining site at sydney mines in 1777. on 14 may 1778, major hierlihy arrived at cape breton. while there, hierlihy reported that he "beat off many piratical attacks, killed some and took other prisoners."
a few years into the war there was also a naval engagement between french ships and a british convoy off sydney, nova scotia, near spanish river (1781), cape breton. french ships (fighting with the americans) were re-coaling and defeated a british convoy. six french sailors were killed and 17 british, with many more wounded.
in 1784, britain split the colony of nova scotia into three separate colonies: new brunswick, cape breton island, and present-day peninsular nova scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of st. john's island (renamed prince edward island in 1798) and newfoundland. the colony of cape breton island had its capital at sydney on its namesake harbour fronting on spanish bay and the cabot strait. its first lieutenant-governor was joseph frederick wallet desbarres (1784–1787) and his successor was william macarmick (1787).
a number of united empire loyalists emigrated to the canadian colonies, including cape breton. david mathews, the former mayor of new york city during the american revolution, emigrated with his family to cape breton in 1783. he succeeded macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.
from 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was john despard, brother of edward.
an order forbidding the granting of land in cape breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. the mineral rights to the island were given over to the duke of york by an order-in-council. the british government had intended that the crown take over the operation of the mines when cape breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. the mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of louisbourg in 1758.
large-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with schooners for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger brigs and brigantines, mostly built for british shipowners. shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the full-rigged ship "lord clarendon", the largest wooden ship ever built in cape breton.
in 1820, the colony of cape breton island was merged for the second time with nova scotia. this development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the sydney coal field of eastern cape breton county. by the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of newfoundland and cape breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.
the 1920s were some of the most violent times in cape breton. they were marked by several severe labour disputes. the famous murder of william davis by strike breakers, and the seizing of the new waterford power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. william davis miners' memorial day is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.
the turn of the 20th century saw cape breton island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors alexander graham bell and guglielmo marconi.
following his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, bell acquired land near baddeck in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in scotland. he established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including helen keller—and continued to invent. baddeck would be the site of his experiments with hydrofoil technologies as well as the aerial experiment association, financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in canada when the aea "silver dart" took off from the ice-covered waters of bras d'or lake. bell also built the forerunner to the iron lung and experimented with breeding sheep.
marconi's contributions to cape breton island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first north american trans-atlantic radio message from a station constructed at table head in glace bay to a receiving station at poldhu in cornwall, england. marconi's pioneering work in cape breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. marconi's station at marconi towers, on the outskirts of glace bay, became the chief communication centre for the royal canadian navy in world war i through to the early years of world war ii.
promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of gaelic once again. the establishment of funding for the gaelic college of celtic arts and crafts and formal gaelic language courses in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to english assimilation.
in the 1960s, the fortress of louisbourg was partially reconstructed by parks canada. since 2009, this national historic site of canada has attracted an average of 90 000 visitors per year.
gaelic speakers in cape breton, as elsewhere in nova scotia, furnished a large proportion of the local population from the eighteenth century on. they brought with them a common culture of poetry, traditional songs and tales, music and dance, and used this to develop distinctive local traditions.
most gaelic settlement in nova scotia happened between 1770 and 1840, with probably over 50,000 gaelic speakers emigrating from the scottish highlands and the hebrides to nova scotia and prince edward island. such emigration was facilitated by changes in gaelic society and the economy, with sharp increases in rents, confiscation of land and disruption of local customs and rights. gaelic settlement in cape breton began in earnest in the early nineteenth century.
the gaelic language became dominant from colchester county in the west of nova scotia into cape breton county in the east. it was reinforced in cape breton in the first half of the 19th century with an influx of highland scots numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the highland clearances.
gaelic speakers, however, tended to be poor; they were largely illiterate and had little access to education. this situation still obtained in the early twentieth century. in 1921 gaelic was approved as an optional subject in the curriculum of nova scotia, but few teachers could be found and children were discouraged from using the language in schools. by 1931 the number of gaelic speakers in nova scotia had fallen to approximately 25,000, mostly in discrete pockets. in cape breton it was still a majority language, but the proportion was falling. children were no longer being raised with gaelic.
from 1939 on attempts were made to strengthen its position in the public school system in nova scotia, but funding, official commitment and the availability of teachers continued to be a problem. by the 1950s the number of speakers was less than 7,000. the advent of multiculturalism in canada in the 1960s meant that new educational opportunities became available, with a gradual strengthening of the language at secondary and tertiary level. at present several schools in cape breton offer gaelic studies and gaelic language programs, and the language is taught at university college of cape breton.
the 2016 canadian census shows that there are only 40 reported speakers of gaelic as a mother tongue in cape breton. on the other hand, there are families and individuals who have recommenced intergenerational transmission. they include fluent speakers from gaelic-speaking areas of scotland and speakers who became fluent in nova scotia and who in some cases studied in scotland. other revitalization activities include adult education, community cultural events and publishing.
the island measures in area, making it the 77th largest island in the world and canada's 18th largest island. cape breton island is composed mainly of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, mountains, woods and plateaus. geological evidence suggests at least part of the island was joined with present-day scotland and norway, now separated by millions of years of plate tectonics.
cape breton island's northern portion is dominated by the cape breton highlands, commonly shortened to simply the "highlands", which are an extension of the appalachian mountain chain. the highlands comprise the northern portions of inverness and victoria counties. in 1936, the federal government established the cape breton highlands national park covering across the northern third of the highlands. the cabot trail scenic highway also encircles the plateau's coastal perimeter.
cape breton island's hydrological features include the bras d'or lake system, a salt-water fjord at the heart of the island, and freshwater features including lake ainslie, the margaree river system, and the mira river. innumerable smaller rivers and streams drain into the bras d'or lake estuary and on to the gulf of st. lawrence and atlantic coasts.
cape breton island is joined to the mainland by the canso causeway, which was completed in 1955, enabling direct road and rail traffic to and from the island, but requiring marine traffic to pass through the canso canal at the eastern end of the causeway.
cape breton island is divided into four counties: cape breton, inverness, richmond, and victoria.
the climate is one of mild, often pleasantly warm summers and cold winters, although the proximity to the atlantic ocean and gulf stream moderates the extreme winter cold found on the mainland, especially on the east side that faces the atlantic. precipitation is abundant year round, with annual totals up to 60 inches on the eastern side facing the atlantic storms. considerable snowfall occurs in winter, especially in the highlands.
the island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures: scottish, mi'kmaq, acadian, irish, english, with respective languages scottish gaelic, mi'kmaq, french, and english. english is now the primary language, including a locally distinctive cape breton accent, while mi'kmaq, scottish gaelic and acadian french are still spoken in some communities.
later migrations of black loyalists, italians, and eastern europeans mostly settled in the island's eastern part around the industrial cape breton region. cape breton island's population has been in decline two decades with an increasing exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.
according to the census of canada, the population of cape breton [economic region] in 2016 / 2011 / 2006 / 1996 was 132,010 / 135,974 / 142,298 / 158,260.
statistics canada in 2001 reported a "religion" total of 145,525 for cape breton, including 5,245 with "no religious affiliation." major categories included:
much of the recent economic history of cape breton island can be tied to the coal industry.
the island has two major coal deposits:
sydney has traditionally been the main port, with facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. it is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the "cape breton post" daily newspaper, as well as one television station, cjcb-tv (ctv), and several radio stations. the marine atlantic terminal at north sydney is the terminal for large ferries traveling to channel-port aux basques and seasonally to argentia, both on the island of newfoundland.
point edward on the west side of sydney harbour is the location of sydport, a former navy base () now converted to commercial use. the canadian coast guard college is nearby at westmount. petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also in sydney harbour.
glace bay, the second largest urban community in population, was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine closed in the 1980s. glace bay was the hub of the sydney & louisburg railway and a major fishing port. at one time, glace bay was known as the largest town in nova scotia, based on population.
port hawkesbury has risen to prominence since the completion of the canso causeway and canso canal created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established. the strait of canso is completely navigable to seawaymax vessels, and port hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans. large marine vessels may also enter bras d'or lake through the great bras d'or channel, and small craft can use the little bras d'or channel or st. peters canal. while commercial shipping no longer uses the st. peters canal, it remains an important waterway for recreational vessels.
the industrial cape breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the cape breton development corporation's (devco) coal mines and the sydney steel corporation's (sysco) steel mill. in recent years, the island's residents have tried to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, call centres, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in fields such as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.
while the cape breton regional municipality is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of cape breton island outside the industrial area surrounding sydney-glace bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.
tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-second world war era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the cabot trail scenic drive. the scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern north america by only newfoundland; and cape breton island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its scottish gaelic heritage through events such as the celtic colours festival, held each october, as well as promotions through the gaelic college of celtic arts and crafts.
whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. whale-watching cruises are operated by vendors from baddeck to cheticamp. the most popular species of whale found in cape breton's waters is the pilot whale.
the island's primary east-west road is highway 105, the trans-canada highway, although trunk 4 is also heavily used. highway 125 is an important arterial route around sydney harbour in the cape breton regional municipality. the cabot trail, circling the cape breton highlands, and trunk 19, along the island's western coast, are important secondary roads. the cape breton and central nova scotia railway maintains railway connections between the port of sydney to the canadian national railway in truro
the cabot trail is a scenic road circuit around and over the cape breton highlands with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the cabot trail each summer and fall. coupled with the fortress of louisbourg, it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. the "condé nast" travel guide has rated cape breton island as one of the world's best island destinations.
cape breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to north america by scottish immigrants during the highland clearances. the traditional style has been well preserved in cape breton, and céilidhs have become a popular attraction for tourists. inverness county in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as mabou and judique. judique is recognized as 'baile nam fonn', (literally: village of tunes) or the 'home of celtic music', featuring the celtic music interpretive centre. performers who have received significant recognition outside of cape breton include bruce guthro, buddy macmaster, natalie macmaster, ashley macisaac, the rankin family, aselin debison, gordie sampson, lee cremo, and the barra macneils. the margaree's of cape breton also serve as a large contributor of fiddle music celebrated throughout the island. this traditional fiddle music of cape breton is studied by musicians around the world, where its global recognition continues to rise.
the men of the deeps are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial cape breton area.
cape breton artists who have been recognized with major national or international awards include actor harold russell of north sydney, who won an academy award in 1946 for his portrayal of homer parrish in "the best years of our lives", and lynn coady and linden macintyre of inverness county, who are both past winners of the giller prize for canadian literature. the rankin family and rita macneil have recorded multiple albums certified as double platinum by music canada.
people from cape breton have also achieved a number of firsts in canadian politics and governance. these include mayann francis of whitney pier, the first black lieutenant governor of nova scotia, isaac phills of sydney, nova scotia, the first person of african descent to be awarded the order of canada, and elizabeth may of margaree harbour, the first member of the green party of canada elected to the house of commons of canada.
cape breton island is also home to youtube weather sensation frankie macdonald. frankie macdonald on his youtube channel "dogsandwolves" has over 100,000 subscribers. he accurately predicted an above magnitude 7 earthquake in new zealand in november 2016.
american artists like sculptor richard serra, composer philip glass and abstract painter john beardman spent part of the year on cape breton island.
steve arbuckle is a canadian born actor born in cape breton island, nova scotia. he started his career as a theatre actor at the boardmore playhouse and savoy theatre, along with other independent theatre companies, then made his first move into film in 2003 with the lead role in the short film todd and the book of pure evil, later becoming a tv show on space as well as an animated film. since then, he has and continues to appear on many feature films and television series, including:"blue bloods", saving hope, murdoch mysteries, falling water (tv series), and many more.
director ashley mckenzie's 2016 film "werewolf" is set on the island and features local actors; mckenzie grew up on the island.
bruce guthro; lead singer and guitarist of the former scottish celtic band runrig, which disbanded in 2018 after 46 years. guthro resides in hammonds plains, nova scotia.

the cthulhu mythos is a shared fictional universe, originating in the works of american horror writer h. p. lovecraft. the term was coined by august derleth, a contemporary correspondent and protégé of lovecraft, to identify the settings, tropes, and lore that were employed by lovecraft and his literary successors. the name "cthulhu" derives from the central creature in lovecraft's seminal short story, "the call of cthulhu", first published in the pulp magazine "weird tales" in 1928.
richard l. tierney, a writer who also wrote mythos tales, later applied the term "derleth mythos" to distinguish lovecraft's works from derleth's later stories, which modify key tenets of the mythos. authors of lovecraftian horror in particular frequently use elements of the cthulhu mythos.
in his essay "h. p. lovecraft and the cthulhu mythos", robert m. price described two stages in the development of the cthulhu mythos. price called the first stage the "cthulhu mythos proper." this stage was formulated during lovecraft's lifetime and was subject to his guidance. the second stage was guided by august derleth who, in addition to publishing lovecraft's stories after his death, attempted to categorize and expand the mythos.
an ongoing theme in lovecraft's work is the complete irrelevance of mankind in the face of the cosmic horrors that apparently exist in the universe. lovecraft made frequent references to the "great old ones", a loose pantheon of ancient, powerful deities from space who once ruled the earth and have since fallen into a deathlike sleep. while these monstrous deities have been present in almost all of lovecraft's published work (his second short story "dagon," published in 1919, is considered the start of the mythos), the first story to really expand the pantheon of great old ones and its themes is "the call of cthulhu," which was published in 1928.
lovecraft broke with other pulp writers of the time by having his main characters' minds deteriorate when afforded a glimpse of what exists outside their perceived reality. he emphasized the point by stating in the opening sentence of the story that "the most merciful thing in the world, i think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."
writer dirk w. mosig notes that lovecraft was a "mechanistic materialist" who embraced the philosophy of "cosmic indifference" (cosmicism). lovecraft believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe. human beings, with their limited faculties, can never fully understand this universe, and the cognitive dissonance caused by this revelation leads to insanity, in his view. this perspective made no allowance for religious belief which could not be supported scientifically, with the incomprehensible, cosmic forces of his tales having as little regard for humanity as humans have for insects.
there have been attempts at categorizing this fictional group of beings. phillip a. schreffler argues that by carefully scrutinizing lovecraft's writings, a workable framework emerges that outlines the entire "pantheon"from the unreachable "outer ones" (e.g. azathoth, who occupies the centre of the universe) and "great old ones" (e.g. cthulhu, imprisoned on earth in the sunken city of r'lyeh) to the lesser castes (the lowly slave shoggoths and the mi-go).
david e. schultz, however, believes that lovecraft never meant to create a canonical mythos but rather intended his imaginary pantheon to merely serve as a background element. lovecraft himself humorously referred to his mythos as "yog sothothery" (dirk w. mosig coincidentally suggested the term "yog-sothoth cycle of myth" be substituted for "cthulhu mythos"). at times, lovecraft even had to remind his readers that his mythos creations were entirely fictional.
the view that there was no rigid structure is expounded upon by s. t. joshi, who said "lovecraft's imaginary cosmogony was never a static system but rather a sort of aesthetic construct that remained ever adaptable to its creator's developing personality and altering interests. . . . there was never a rigid system that might be posthumously appropriated. . . . the essence of the mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deities nor in a cobwebby collection of forgotten tomes, but rather in a certain convincing cosmic attitude."
price, however, believed that lovecraft's writings could at least be divided into categories and identified three distinct themes: the "dunsanian" (written a similar style as lord dunsany), "arkham" (occurring in lovecraft's fictionalized new england setting), and "cthulhu" (the cosmic tales) cycles. writer will murray noted that while lovecraft often used his fictional pantheon in the stories he ghostwrote for other authors, he reserved arkham and its environs exclusively for those tales he wrote under his own name.
although the mythos was not formalized or acknowledged between them, lovecraft did correspond and share story elements with other contemporary writers including clark ashton smith, robert e. howard, robert bloch, frank belknap long, henry kuttner, henry s. whitehead, and fritz leibera group referred to as the "lovecraft circle."
for example, robert e. howard's character friedrich von junzt reads lovecraft's "necronomicon" in the short story "the children of the night" (1931), and in turn lovecraft mentions howard's "unaussprechlichen kulten" in the stories "out of the aeons" (1935) and "the shadow out of time" (1936). many of howard's original unedited "conan" stories also involve parts of the cthulhu mythos.
price denotes the second stage's commencement with august derleth. the principal difference between lovecraft and derleth being derleth's use of hope and development of the idea that the cthulhu mythos essentially represented a struggle between good and evil. derleth is credited with creating the "elder gods." he stated:
price believes that the basis for derleth's system is found in lovecraft: "was derleth's use of the rubric 'elder gods' so alien to lovecraft's in "at the mountains of madness"? perhaps not. in fact, this very story, along with some hints from "the shadow over innsmouth", provides the key to the origin of the 'derleth mythos'. for in "at the mountains of madness" is shown the history of a conflict between interstellar races, first among them the elder ones and the cthulhu-spawn.
derleth himself believed that lovecraft wished for other authors to actively write about the mythos as opposed to it being a discrete plot device within lovecraft's own stories. derleth expanded the boundaries of the mythos by including any passing reference to another author's story elements by lovecraft as part of the genre. just as lovecraft made passing reference to clark ashton smith's "book of eibon", derleth in turn added smith's ubbo-sathla to the mythos.
derleth also attempted to connect the deities of the mythos to the four elements ("air", "earth", "fire", and "water"), creating new beings representative of certain elements in order to legitimize his system of classification. derleth created "cthugha" as a sort of fire elemental when a fan, francis towner laney, complained that he had neglected to include the element in his schema. laney, the editor of "the acolyte", had categorized the mythos in an essay that first appeared in the winter 1942 issue of the magazine.
impressed by the glossary, derleth asked laney to rewrite it for publication in the arkham house collection "beyond the wall of sleep" (1943). laney's essay ("the cthulhu mythos") was later republished in "crypt of cthulhu #32" (1985). in applying the elemental theory to beings that function on a cosmic scale (e.g. yog-sothoth) some authors created a fifth element that they termed "aethyr".

in filmmaking and video production, a crane shot is a shot taken by a camera on a moving crane or jib. most cranes accommodate both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by remote control. camera cranes go back to the dawn of movie-making, and were frequently used in silent films to enhance the epic nature of large sets and massive crowds. another use is to move up and away from the actors, a common way of ending a movie. crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. one example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of the 1985 film "to live and die in l.a.". some filmmakers place the camera on a boom arm simply to make it easier to move around between ordinary set-ups.
the major supplier of cranes in the cinema of the united states throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s was the chapman company (later chapman-leonard of north hollywood), supplanted by dozens of similar manufacturers around the world. the traditional design provided seats for both the director and the camera operator, and sometimes a third seat for the cinematographer as well. large weights on the back of the crane compensate for the weight of the people riding the crane and must be adjusted carefully to avoid the possibility of accidents. during the 1960s, the tallest crane was the chapman titan crane, a massive design over 20 feet high that won an academy scientific & engineering award. most such cranes were manually operated, requiring an experienced boom operator who knew how to vertically raise, lower, and "crab" the camera alongside actors while the crane platform rolled on separate tracks. the crane operator and camera operator had to precisely coordinate their moves so that focus, pan, and camera position all started and stopped at the same time, requiring great skill and rehearsal.
camera cranes may be small, medium, or large, depending on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the chamber together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. the range of motion of the boom was restricted because of the high load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. in recent years a camera crane boom tripod with a remote control has become popular. it carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the crane boom and relative freedom of movement. the operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. a separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. these devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic jib crane radial displacement that comes with traditional spanning shots.
large camera cranes are almost indistinguishable from the usual boom-type cranes, with the exception of special equipment for smoothly moving the boom and controlling noise. small camera cranes and crane-trucks have a lightweight construction, often without a mechanical drive. the valves are controlled manually by balancing the load-specific counterweight, facilitating manipulation. to improve usability and repeatability of movement of the crane in different takes, the axis of rotation arrows are provided with limbs and a pointer. in some cases, the camera crane is mounted on a dolly for even greater camera mobility. such devices are called crane trolleys. in modern films robotic cranes allow use of multiple actuators for high-accuracy repeated movement of the camera in trick photography. these devices are called tap-robots; some sources use the term motion control.
during the last few years, camera cranes have been miniaturized and costs have dropped so dramatically that most aspiring film makers have access to these tools. what was once a "hollywood" effect is now available for under $400. main producers of cranes companies include abc-products, cambo, filmotechnic, polecam, panther and matthews studio equipment.

chariots of fire is a 1981 british historical drama film. it tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the 1924 olympics: eric liddell, a devout scottish christian who runs for the glory of god, and harold abrahams, an english jew who runs to overcome prejudice.
the film was conceived and produced by david puttnam, written by colin welland, and directed by hugh hudson. ben cross and ian charleson starred as abrahams and liddell, alongside nigel havers, ian holm, lindsay anderson, john gielgud, cheryl campbell, and alice krige in supporting roles.
it was nominated for seven academy awards and won four, including best picture and best original screenplay. it is ranked 19th in the british film institute's list of top 100 british films. the film is also notable for its memorable electronic theme tune by vangelis, who won the academy award for best original score.
the film's title was inspired by the line, "bring me my chariot of fire!", from the william blake poem adapted into the popular british hymn "jerusalem"; the hymn is heard at the end of the film. the original phrase "chariot(s) of fire" is from 2 kings and in the bible.
in 1919, harold abrahams (ben cross) enters the university of cambridge, where he experiences anti-semitism from the staff, but enjoys participating in the gilbert and sullivan club. he becomes the first person to ever complete the trinity great court run, running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. although focused on his running, he falls in love with sybil (alice krige), a leading gilbert and sullivan soprano.
eric liddell (ian charleson), born in china of scottish missionary parents, is in scotland. his devout sister jennie (cheryl campbell) disapproves of liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but liddell sees running as a way of glorifying god before returning to china to work as a missionary.
when they first race against each other, liddell beats abrahams. abrahams takes it poorly, but sam mussabini (ian holm), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. this attracts criticism from the cambridge college masters (john gielgud and lindsay anderson), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-semitic and class-based prejudice.
when eric liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about god. eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the china mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour god, saying "i believe that god made me for a purpose. but he also made me fast, and when i run, i feel his pleasure."
the two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent great britain in the 1924 olympics in paris. also accepted are abrahams' cambridge friends, lord andrew lindsay (nigel havers), aubrey montague (nicholas farrell), and henry stallard (daniel gerroll).
while boarding the boat to paris for the olympics, liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a sunday. he refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the prince of wales and the british olympic committee, because his christian convictions prevent him from running on the sabbath.
a solution is found thanks to liddell's teammate lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles, offers to give his place in the 400-metre race on the following thursday to liddell, who gratefully agrees. liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.
liddell delivers a sermon at the paris church of scotland that sunday, and quotes from , ending with "but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured united states runners in the 200 metre race. he knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. he competes in the race, and wins. his coach sam mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an olympic gold medal. now abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.
before liddell's race, the american coach remarks dismissively to his runners that liddell has little chance of doing well in his now, far longer, 400 metre race. but one of the american runners, jackson scholz, hands liddell a note of support, quoting 1 samuel 2:30 "he that honors me i will honor". liddell defeats the american favourites and wins the gold medal.
the british team returns home triumphant. as the film ends, onscreen text explains that abrahams married sybil and became the elder statesman of british athletics. liddell went on to missionary work in china. all of scotland mourned his death in 1945 in japanese-occupied china.
the film depicts abrahams as attending gonville and caius college, cambridge with three other olympic athletes: henry stallard, aubrey montague, and lord andrew lindsay. abrahams and stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 olympics. montague also competed in the olympics as depicted, but he attended oxford, not cambridge. aubrey montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at oxford and the olympics; these letters were the basis of montague's narration in the film.
the character of lindsay was based partially on lord burghley, a significant figure in the history of british athletics. although burghley did attend cambridge, he was not a contemporary of harold abrahams, as abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and burghley was at cambridge from 1923 to 1927. one scene in the film depicts the burghley-based "lindsay" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses. the fictional character of lindsay was created when douglas lowe, who was britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.
another scene in the film recreates the great court run, in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the great court at trinity college, cambridge in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. the film shows abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. in fact, abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was lord burghley, in 1927. in "chariots of fire", lindsay, who is based on lord burghley, runs the great court run with abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. since the film's release, the great court run has also been successfully run by trinity undergraduate sam dobin, in october 2007.
in the film, eric liddell is tripped up by a frenchman in the 400-metre event of a scotland–france international athletic meeting. he recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. this was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a triangular contest meet between scotland, england, and ireland at stoke-on-trent in england in july 1923. his achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day. also unmentioned with regard to liddell is that it was he who introduced abrahams to sam mussabini. this is alluded to: in the film abrahams first encounters mussabini while he is watching liddell race. the film, however, suggests that abrahams himself sought mussabini's assistance.
abrahams and liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered abrahams at the 1923 aaa championship at stamford bridge. in fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which liddell won, five yards ahead of abrahams, who did not progress to the final. in the 100 yards, abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.
abrahams' fiancée is misidentified as sybil gordon, a soprano at the d'oyly carte opera company. in fact, in 1936, abrahams married sybil evers, who sang at the d'oyly carte, but they did not meet until 1934. also, in the film, sybil is depicted as singing the role of yum-yum in "the mikado", but neither sybil gordon nor sybil evers ever sang that role with d'oyly carte, although evers was known for her charm in singing peep-bo, one of the two other "little maids from school". harold abrahams' love of and heavy involvement with gilbert and sullivan, as depicted in the film, is factual.
liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. her disapproval of liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. jenny liddell somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the paris church of scotland during liddell's sermon.
at the memorial service for harold abrahams, which opens the film, lord lindsay mentions that he and aubrey montague are the only members of the 1924 olympic team still alive. however, montague died in 1948, 30 years before abrahams' death.
the film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 olympics, including the events surrounding liddell's refusal to race on a sunday. in the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the christian sabbath until he is boarding the boat to paris. in fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the british olympic committee, the prince of wales, and other grandees, and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.
the decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to paris, and liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. it is true, nonetheless, that liddell's success in the olympic 400m was largely unexpected.
the film depicts lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for liddell. in fact burghley, on whom lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.
the film reverses the order of abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the olympics. in reality, after winning the 100 metres race, abrahams ran the 200 metres but finished last, jackson scholz taking the gold medal. in the film, before his triumph in the 100m, abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by mussabini. and during the following scene in which abrahams speaks with his friend montague while receiving a massage from mussabini, there is a french newspaper clipping showing scholz and charley paddock with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the united states. in the same conversation, abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. the film thus has abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.
eric liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind paddock and scholz. this was the only time in reality that liddell and abrahams competed in the same race. while their meeting in the 1923 aaa championship in the film was fictitious, liddell's record win in that race did spur abrahams to train even harder.
abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the 4 x 100 metres relay team, not shown in the film, and aubrey montague placed sixth in the steeplechase, as depicted.
in the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called "tom watson"; the real medallist was arthur porritt of new zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary. however, the brief back-story given for watson, who is called up to the new zealand team from the university of oxford, substantially matches porritt's history. with the exception of porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the prince of wales.
jackson scholz is depicted as handing liddell an inspirational bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: "it says in the old book, 'he that honors me, i will honor.' good luck." in reality, the note was from members of the british team, and was handed to liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's paris hotel. for dramatic purposes, screenwriter welland asked scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and scholz readily agreed, saying "yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."
producer david puttnam was looking for a story in the mold of "a man for all seasons" (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this sense. he discovered eric liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in los angeles.
screenwriter colin welland, commissioned by puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his academy award-winning script. among other things, he took out advertisements in london newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 olympics, went to the national film archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. welland just missed abrahams, who died 14 january 1978, but he did attend abrahams' february 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film. aubrey montague's son saw welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "darling mummy" to "dear mum" and the change from oxford to cambridge, all of the readings from montague's letters are from the originals.
welland's original script also featured, in addition to eric liddell and harold abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 olympic gold medallist douglas lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. however, lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of lord andrew lindsay.
ian charleson wrote eric liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the scotland v. ireland races. charleson, who had studied the bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director hugh hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. hudson and welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.
the film was slightly altered for the u.s. audience. a brief scene depicting a pre-olympics cricket game between abrahams, liddell, montague, and the rest of the british track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. for the american audience, this brief scene was deleted. in the u.s., to avoid the initial g rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting abrahams and montague arriving at a cambridge railway station and encountering two world war i veterans who use an obscenity – in order to be given a pg rating.
puttnam chose hugh hudson, a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct "chariots of fire". hudson and puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when puttnam was an advertising executive and hudson was making films for ad agencies. in 1977, hudson had also been second-unit director on the puttnam-produced film "midnight express".
director hugh hudson was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like john gielgud, lindsay anderson, and ian holm as their supporting cast. hudson and producer david puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play eric liddell. they then saw scottish stage actor ian charleson performing the role of pierre in the royal shakespeare company's production of "piaf", and knew immediately they had found their man. unbeknownst to them, charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove".
ben cross, who plays harold abrahams, was discovered while playing billy flynn in "chicago". in addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano. cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.
20th century fox, which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of north america, insisted on having a couple of notable american names in the cast. thus the small parts of the two american champion runners, jackson scholz and charlie paddock, were cast with recent headliners: brad davis had recently starred in "midnight express" (also produced by puttnam), and dennis christopher had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film "breaking away".
all of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive with renowned running coach tom mcnab. this training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.
although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the academy award-winning original soundtrack composed by vangelis uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of synthesizer and piano among other instruments. this was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. the title theme of the film has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.
vangelis, a greek-born electronic composer who moved to paris in the late 1960s, had been living in london since 1974. director hugh hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums "opera sauvage" and "china". david puttnam also greatly admired vangelis's body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film "midnight express". hudson made the choice for vangelis and for a modern score: "i knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. it was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score." the soundtrack had a personal significance to vangelis: after composing the iconic theme tune he told puttnam, "my father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him."
hudson originally wanted vangelis's 1977 tune "l'enfant", from his "opera sauvage" album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with "l'enfant" playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. vangelis finally convinced hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme – and when he played the now-iconic "chariots of fire" theme for hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better. the "l'enfant" melody still made it into the film: when the athletes reach paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece. vangelis's electronic "l'enfant" track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film "the year of living dangerously".
some pieces of vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. one of them is the background music to the race eric liddell runs in the scottish highlands. this piece is a version of "hymne", the original version of which appears on vangelis's 1979 album, "opéra sauvage". various versions are also included on vangelis's compilation albums "themes", "portraits", and "", though none of these include the version used in the film.
five lively gilbert and sullivan tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints vangelis's modern electronic score. these are: "he is an englishman" from "h.m.s. pinafore", "three little maids from school are we" from "the mikado", "with catlike tread" from "the pirates of penzance", "the soldiers of our queen" from "patience", and "there lived a king" from "the gondoliers".
the film also incorporates a major traditional work: "jerusalem", sung by a british choir at the 1978 funeral of harold abrahams. the words, written by william blake in 1804-8, were set to music by parry in 1916 as a celebration of england. this hymn has been described as "england's unofficial national anthem", concludes the film and inspired its title. a handful of other traditional anthems and hymns and period-appropriate instrumental ballroom-dance music round out the film's soundtrack.
the beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at west sands, st andrews. a plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today. the very last scene of the opening titles crosses the 1st and 18th holes of the old course at st andrews links.
all of the cambridge scenes were actually filmed at hugh hudson's alma mater eton college, because cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-semitism. the cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the film's enormous success.
liverpool town hall was the setting for the scenes depicting the british embassy in paris. the colombes olympic stadium in paris was represented by the oval sports centre, bebington, merseyside. the nearby woodside ferry terminal was used to represent the embarkation scenes set in dover. the railway station scenes were filmed in york, using locomotives from the national railway museum. the scene depicting a performance of "the mikado" was filmed in the royal court theatre, liverpool with members of the d'oyly carte opera company who were on tour.
"chariots of fire" became a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 summer olympics in london. the film's theme tune was featured at the opening of the 2012 london new years fireworks celebrating the olympics, and the film's iconic beach-running scene and theme tune were used in "the sun"'s "let's make it great, britain" olympic ads. the runners who first tested the new olympic park were spurred on by the "chariots of fire" theme tune, and the iconic music was also used to fanfare the carriers of the olympic flame on parts of its route through the uk. the beach-running sequence was also recreated at st. andrews and filmed as part of the olympic torch relay.
the film's theme was also performed by the london symphony orchestra, conducted by simon rattle, during the opening ceremony of the games; the performance was accompanied by a comedy skit by rowan atkinson (as mr bean) which included the opening beach-running footage from the film. the film's theme tune was also played during each medal ceremony of the 2012 olympics.
a stage adaptation of "chariots of fire" was mounted in honour of the 2012 olympics. the play, "chariots of fire", which was adapted by playwright mike bartlett and included the iconic vangelis score, ran from 9 may to 16 june 2012 at london's hampstead theatre, and transferred to the gielgud theatre in the west end on 23 june, where it ran until 5 january 2013. it starred jack lowden as eric liddell and james mcardle as harold abrahams, and edward hall directed. stage designer miriam buether transformed each theatre into an olympic stadium, and composer jason carr wrote additional music. vangelis also created several new pieces of music for the production. the stage version for the london olympic year was the idea of the film's director, hugh hudson, who co-produced the play; he stated, "issues of faith, of refusal to compromise, standing up for one's beliefs, achieving something for the sake of it, with passion, and not just for fame or financial gain, are even more vital today."
another play, "running for glory", written by philip dart, based on the 1924 olympics, and focusing on abrahams and liddell, toured parts of britain from 25 february to 1 april 2012. it starred nicholas jacobs as harold abrahams, and tom micklem as eric liddell.
as an official part of the london 2012 festival celebrations, a new digitally re-mastered version of the film screened in 150 cinemas throughout the uk. the re-release began 13 july 2012, two weeks before the opening ceremony of the london olympics.
a blu-ray of the film was released on 10 july 2012 in north america, and was released 16 july 2012 in the uk. the release includes nearly an hour of special features, a cd sampler, and a 32-page "digibook".
since its release "chariots of fire" has received generally positive reviews from critics. the film holds an 83% "certified fresh" rating on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on 64 reviews, accompanied by the summary "decidedly slower and less limber than the olympic runners at the center of its story, the film nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes."
for its 2012 re-release, kate muir of "the times" gave the film five stars, writing: "in a time when drug tests and synthetic fibres have replaced gumption and moral fibre, the tale of two runners competing against each other in the 1924 olympics has a simple, undiminished power. from the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by vangelis's now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling."
"chariots of fire" was very successful at the 54th academy awards, winning four of seven nominations. when accepting his oscar for best original screenplay, colin welland famously announced "the british are coming". at the 1981 cannes film festival the film won two awards and competed for the palme d'or.
american film institute recognition

consequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence.
consequentialism is primarily non-prescriptive, meaning the moral worth of an action is determined by its potential consequence, not by whether it follows a set of written edicts or laws. one example would entail lying under the threat of government punishment to save an innocent person's life, even though it is illegal to lie under oath.
consequentialism is usually contrasted with deontological ethics (or "deontology"), in that deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. it is also contrasted with virtue ethics, which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and pragmatic ethics which treats morality like science: advancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision. consequentialist theories differ in how they define moral goods.
some argue that consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. for example, t. m. scanlon advances the idea that human rights, which are commonly considered a "deontological" concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights. similarly, robert nozick argued for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable "side-constraints" which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do. derek parfit argued that in practice, when understood properly, rule consequentialism, kantian deontology and contractualism would all end up prescribing the same.
state consequentialism, also known as mohist consequentialism, is an ethical theory which evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the welfare of a state. according to the "stanford encyclopedia of philosophy", mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century bce, is the "world's earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare".
unlike utilitarianism, which views utility as the sole moral good, "the basic goods in mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population". during mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. the "material wealth" of mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the "order" of mohist consequentialism refers to mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability. stanford sinologist david shepherd nivison, in "the cambridge history of ancient china", writes that the moral goods of mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically".
the mohists believed that morality is based on "promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven". in contrast to jeremy bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. the importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain. the term state consequentialism has also been applied to the political philosophy of the confucian philosopher xunzi.
on the other hand, the "legalist" han fei "is motivated almost totally from the ruler's point of view".
in summary, jeremy bentham states that people are driven by their interests and their fears, but their interests take precedence over their fears, and their interests are carried out in accordance with how people view the consequences that might be involved with their interests. "happiness" on this account is defined as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain. it can be argued that the existence of phenomenal consciousness and "qualia" is required for the experience of pleasure or pain to have an ethical significance. historically, hedonistic utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. this form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is the aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone and not the happiness of any particular person. john stuart mill, in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures. however, some contemporary utilitarians, such as peter singer, are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, hence "preference utilitarianism". other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.
ethical egoism can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others. some, like henry sidgwick, argue that a certain degree of egoism "promotes" the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.
ethical altruism can be seen as a consequentialist ethic which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for himself. this was advocated by auguste comte, who coined the term "altruism," and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase "live for others".
in general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. however, this need not be the case. rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile deontology and consequentialism—and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism. like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. however, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules has. rule consequentialism exists in the forms of rule utilitarianism and rule egoism.
various theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. for example, robert nozick held that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls "side-constraints", are necessary to ensure appropriate actions. there are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. thus, while nozick's side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, amartya sen proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute. that is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.
one of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).
brad hooker avoided this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. he writes:
…the best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. the best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties.
derek parfit described brad hooker's book on rule-consequentialism "ideal code, real world" as the "best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories".
rule-consequentialism may offer a means to reconcile pure consequentialism with deontological, or rules-based ethics.
the two-level approach involves engaging in critical reasoning and considering all the possible ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one is not in a position to stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. in practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.
this position can be described as a reconciliation between act consequentialism – in which the morality of an action is determined by that action's effects – and rule consequentialism – in which moral behavior is derived from following rules that lead to positive outcomes.
the two-level approach to consequentialism is most often associated with r. m. hare and peter singer.
another consequentialist version is motive consequentialism which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. this version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. an act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. a possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.
most consequentialist theories focus on "promoting" some sort of good consequences. however, negative utilitarianism lays out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences.
one major difference between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. in weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. an example of this is the slippery slope argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act on the grounds that it may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.
often "negative" consequentialist theories assert that reducing suffering is more important than increasing pleasure. karl popper, for example, claimed "…from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure...". (while popper is not a consequentialist per se, this is taken as a classic statement of negative utilitarianism.) when considering a theory of justice, negative consequentialists may use a statewide or global-reaching principle: the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) is more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).
teleological ethics (greek telos, "end"; logos, "science") is an ethical theory that holds that the ends or consequences of an act determine whether an act is good or evil. teleological theories are often discussed in opposition to deontological ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are "inherently" good or evil, regardless of the consequences of acts. the saying, "the end justifies the means", meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.
teleological theories differ on the nature of the end that actions ought to promote. eudaemonist theories (greek eudaimonia, "happiness") hold that the goal of ethics consists in some function or activity appropriate to man as a human being, and thus tend to emphasize the cultivation of virtue or excellence in the agent as the end of all action. these could be the classical virtues—courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom—that promoted the greek ideal of man as the "rational animal", or the theological virtues—faith, hope, and love—that distinguished the christian ideal of man as a being created in the image of god.
utilitarian-type theories hold that the end consists in an experience or feeling produced by the action. hedonism, for example, teaches that this feeling is pleasure—either one's own, as in egoism (the 17th-century english philosopher thomas hobbes), or everyone's, as in universalistic hedonism, or utilitarianism (the 19th-century english philosophers jeremy bentham, john stuart mill, and henry sidgwick), with its formula of the "greatest pleasure of the greatest number".
other utilitarian-type views include the claims that the end of action is survival and growth, as in evolutionary ethics (the 19th-century english philosopher herbert spencer); the experience of power, as in despotism; satisfaction and adjustment, as in pragmatism (20th-century american philosophers ralph barton perry and john dewey); and freedom, as in existentialism (the 20th-century french philosopher jean-paul sartre).
the chief problem for eudaemonist theories is to show that leading a life of virtue will also be attended by happiness—by the winning of the goods regarded as the chief end of action. that job should suffer and socrates and jesus die while the wicked prosper, then seems unjust. eudaemonists generally reply that the universe is moral and that, in socrates' words, "no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death," or, in jesus' words, "but he who endures to the end will be saved." (matt 10:22).
utilitarian theories, on the other hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. the problem arises in these theories because they tend to separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. one implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. the goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it by the nature of the act itself—even if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, if it really is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. ideal utilitarianism (g.e. moore and hastings rashdall) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as john stuart mill affirmed, "may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good".
since pure consequentialism holds that an action is to be judged solely by its result, most consequentialist theories hold that a deliberate action is no different from a deliberate decision not to act. this contrasts with the "acts and omissions doctrine", which is upheld by some medical ethicists and some religions: it asserts there is a significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate non-actions which lead to the same outcome. this contrast is brought out in issues such as voluntary euthanasia.
one important characteristic of many normative moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. at the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. what is primarily at stake here is the "responsibility" of the agent.
one common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an altruistic (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. john rawls, a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer. the particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.
in practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. for this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. however, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. as a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. this imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.
moral action always has consequences for certain people or things. varieties of consequentialism can be differentiated by the beneficiary of the good consequences. that is, one might ask "consequences for whom?"
a fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives, and theories which permit that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or motivation. these are called "agent-neutral" and "agent-focused" theories respectively.
agent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that peter railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent is "more" concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.
these two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent's interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. for example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.
many consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. however, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. jeremy bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. more recently, peter singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.
one way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. according to utilitarianism, a good action is one that results in an increase in pleasure, and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. closely related is eudaimonic consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. however, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. thus, one might pursue an increase in material equality or political liberty instead of something like the more ephemeral "pleasure". other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally. as the consequentialist approach contains an inherent assumption that the outcomes of a moral decision can be quantified in terms of "goodness" or "badness", or at least put in order of increasing preference, it is an especially suited moral theory for a probabilistic and decision theoretical approach.
consequentialism can also be contrasted with aretaic moral theories such as virtue ethics. whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. for example, philippa foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.
however, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic. iain king has developed an approach that reconciles the two schools. other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. finally, following foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.
the "ultimate end" is a concept in the moral philosophy of max weber, in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.
the term "consequentialism" was g. e. m. anscombe in her essay "modern moral philosophy" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by mill and sidgwick.
the phrase and concept of "the end justifies the means" are at least as old as the first century bc. ovid wrote in his heroides that "exitus acta probat" "the result justifies the deed".
g. e. m. anscombe objects to consequentialism on the grounds that it does not provide ethical guidance in what one ought to do because there is no distinction between consequences that are foreseen and those that are intended.
the future amplification of the effects of small decisions is an important factor that makes it more difficult to predict the ethical value of consequences, even though most would agree that only predictable consequences are charged with a moral responsibility.
bernard williams has argued that consequentialism is alienating because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. he argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. for example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.
some consequentialists—most notably peter railton—have attempted to develop a form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by williams. railton argues that williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the sort of life that they express. on his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.

conscription, sometimes called the draft, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. the modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the french revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. most european nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.
conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including conscientious objection to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country, and seeking asylum in another country. some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing alternative service outside combat-operations roles or even outside the military, such as "siviilipalvelus" (alternative civil service) in finland, "zivildienst" (compulsory community service) in austria and switzerland. several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to police-like "domestic only" service like internal troops, border guards or "non-combat" rescue duties like civil defence.
as of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with volunteers. the ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis. states involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, whereas democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription. former british colonies are less likely to have conscription, as they are influenced by british anti-conscription norms that can be traced back to the english civil war.
around the reign of hammurabi (1791–1750 bc), the babylonian empire used a system of conscription called "ilkum". under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. during times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. in return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. it is possible that this right was not to hold land "per se" but specific land supplied by the state.
various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. while it was outlawed by the code of hammurabi, the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. later records show that ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. in other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their ilkum service. another option was to sell ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. with the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the code of hammurabi.
in medieval scandinavia the "leiðangr" (old norse), "leidang" (norwegian), "leding", (danish), "ledung" (swedish), "lichting" (dutch), "expeditio" (latin) or sometimes "leþing" (old english), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.
the bulk of the anglo-saxon english army, called the "fyrd", was composed of part-time english soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. in the 690s laws of ine, three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service. some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. these thegns were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. the historian david sturdy has cautioned about regarding the "fyrd" as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a "ridiculous fantasy":the persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or "fyrd" is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.
medieval levy in poland was known as the "pospolite ruszenie".
the system of military slaves was widely used in the middle east, beginning with the creation of the corps of turkish slave-soldiers ("ghulams" or "mamluks") by the abbasid caliph al-mu'tasim in the 820s and 830s. the turkish troops soon came to dominate the government, establishing a pattern throughout the islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the mamluks of egypt and the janissary corps of the ottoman empire, institutions that survived until the early 19th century.
in the middle of the 14th century, ottoman sultan murad i developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the "kapıkulu". the new force was built by taking christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the "devşirme" (translated "gathering" or "converting"). the captive children were forced to convert to islam. the sultans had the young boys trained over several years. those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the janissaries, the elite branch of the "kapıkulu". a number of distinguished military commanders of the ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the empire, such as pargalı ibrahim pasha and sokollu mehmet paşa, were recruited in this way. by 1609, the sultan's "kapıkulu" forces increased to about 100,000.
in later years, sultans turned to the barbary pirates to supply their jannissaries corps. their attacks on ships off the coast of africa or in the mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the sultan's system. starting in the 17th century, christian families living under the ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. eventually the sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of circassians in southern russia to fill his janissary armies. as a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the jannissaries became increasingly suspect. mahmud ii forcibly disbanded the janissary corps in 1826.
similar to the janissaries in origin and means of development were the mamluks of egypt in the middle ages. the mamluks were usually captive non-muslim iranian and turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the barbary coasts. the egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become islamic soldiers who served the muslim caliphs and the ayyubid sultans during the middle ages. the first mamluks served the abbasid caliphs in 9th-century baghdad. over time they became a powerful military caste. on more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling egypt from 1250 to 1517.
from 1250 egypt had been ruled by the bahri dynasty of kipchak origin. slaves from the caucasus served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. they eventually revolted in egypt to form the burgi dynasty. the mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the christian crusader fortresses in the holy land. the mamluks were the most successful defense against the mongol ilkhanate of persia and iraq from entering egypt.
on the western coast of africa, berber muslims captured non-muslims to put to work as laborers. they generally converted the younger people to islam and many became quite assimilated. in morocco, the berber looked south rather than north. the moroccan sultan moulay ismail, called "the bloodthirsty" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his black guard. he used them to coerce the country into submission.
modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the french revolution, to enable the republic to defend itself from the attacks of european monarchies. deputy jean-baptiste jourdan gave its name to the 5 september 1798 act, whose first article stated: "any frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation." it enabled the creation of the "grande armée", what napoleon bonaparte called "the nation in arms", which overwhelmed european professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. more than 2.6 million men were inducted into the french military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.
the defeat of the prussian army in particular shocked the prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of frederick the great. the prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. however, they became considerably less important when the prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. scharnhorst advocated adopting the "levée en masse", the military conscription used by france. the "krümpersystem" was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.
in the russian empire, the military service time "owed" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century. in 1834 it was decreased to 20 years. the recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35. in 1874 russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of serfdom in 1861. new military law decreed that all male russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.
in the decades prior to world war i universal conscription along broadly prussian lines became the norm for european armies, and those modeled on them. by 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of britain and the united states. some colonial powers such as france reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.
the range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the world wars.
in the united states, the selective service system drafted men for world war i initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45. in the case of a widespread mobilization of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility. expanded-age conscription was common during the second world war: in britain, it was commonly known as "call-up" and extended to age 51. nazi germany termed it "volkssturm" ("people's storm") and included children as young as 16 and men as old as 60. during the second world war, both britain and the soviet union conscripted women. the united states was on the verge of drafting women into the nurse corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of japan. however, the japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned.
feminists and other opponents of discrimination against men have criticized military conscription, or compulsory military service, as sexist.
feminists have argued that military conscription is sexist because wars serve the interests of what they view as the patriarchy, the military is a sexist institution, conscripts are therefore indoctrinated in sexism, and conscription of men normalizes violence by men as socially acceptable. feminists have been organizers and participants in resistance to conscription in several countries.
historically, only men have been subjected to conscription. men who opt out of military service must often perform alternative service, such as zivildienst in austria and switzerland, whereas women do not have these obligations.
american libertarians oppose conscription and call for the abolition of the selective service system, believing that impressment of individuals into the armed forces is "involuntary servitude." ron paul, a former presidential nominee of the u.s. libertarian party has said that conscription "is wrongly associated with patriotism, when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude." the philosopher ayn rand opposed conscription, suggesting that "of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. it is an abrogation of rights. it negates man's fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man's life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle."
in 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including emma goldman, challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the thirteenth amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. however, the supreme court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of "arver v. united states" on 7 january 1918. the decision said the constitution gave congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. the court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
it can be argued that in a cost-to-benefit ratio, conscription during peacetime is not worthwhile. months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. in the united states, every male resident is required by law to register with the selective service system within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.
the cost of conscription can be related to the parable of the broken window in anti-draft arguments. the cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. the work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. the impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. this may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. however, this is potentially more costly in a post-industrial society where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.
jean jacques rousseau argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. he based this belief upon the development of the roman republic, which came to an end at the same time as the roman army changed from a conscript to professional force. similarly, aristotle linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state. niccolò machiavelli argued strongly for conscription, seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in italy.
other proponents, such as william james, consider both mandatory military and national service as ways of instilling maturity in young adults. some proponents, such as jonathan alter and mickey kaus, support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and for young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise. charles rangel called for the reinstatement of the draft during the iraq war, not because he seriously expected it to be adopted, but to stress how the socioeconomic restratification meant that very few children of upper-class americans served in the all-volunteer american armed forces.
it is estimated by the british military that in a professional military, a company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. salaries for each are paid from the military budget. in contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.
it was more financially beneficial for less-educated young portuguese men born in 1967 to participate in conscription, as opposed to participating in the highly competitive job market with men of the same age who continued through to higher education.
traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population of a given body. women and disabled men have been exempt from conscription. many societies have considered, and continue to consider, military service as a test of manhood and a rite of passage from boyhood into manhood.
only a few nations actively draft women into military service: bolivia,
chad,
eritrea,
israel,
mozambique,
norway,
north korea
and sweden.
norway introduced female conscription in 2015, making it the first nato member to have a legally compulsory national service for both men and women. in practice only motivated volunteers are selected to join the army in norway.
sweden introduced female conscription in 2010, but it was not activated until 2017. this made sweden the second nation in europe to draft women, and the second in the world to draft women on exactly the same formal terms as men.
israel has universal female conscription, although in practice women can avoid service by claiming a religious exemption and over a third of israeli women do so.
sudanese law allows for conscription of women, but this is not implemented in practice.
in the united kingdom during world war ii, beginning in 1941, women were brought into the scope of conscription but, as all women with dependent children were exempt and many women were informally left in occupations such as nursing or teaching, the number conscripted was relatively few.
in the ussr, there was no systematic conscription of women for the armed forces, but the severe disruption of normal life and the high proportion of civilians affected by world war ii after the german invasion attracted many volunteers for what was termed "the great patriotic war". medical doctors of both sexes could and would be conscripted (as officers). also, the soviet university education system required department of chemistry students of both sexes to complete an rotc course in nbc defense, and such female reservist officers could be conscripted in times of war. the united states came close to drafting women into the nurse corps in preparation for a planned invasion of japan.
in 1981 in the united states, several men filed lawsuit in the case "rostker v. goldberg", alleging that the selective service act of 1948 violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment by requiring that only men register with the selective service system (sss). the supreme court eventually upheld the act, stating that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"
on october 1, 1999 in taiwan, the judicial yuan of the republic of china in its interpretation 490 considered that the physical differences between males and females and the derived role differentiation in their respective social functions and lives would not make drafting only males a violation of the constitution of the republic of china. though women are not conscripted in taiwan, transsexual persons are exempt.
a conscientious objector is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with military service, or, more often, with any role in the armed forces. in some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. for example, sweden used to allow (and once again, with the re-introduction of conscription, allows) conscientious objectors to choose a service in the "weapons-free" branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse, or telecommunications technician.
the reasons for refusing to serve in the military are varied. some people are conscientious objectors for religious reasons. in particular, the members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine, and jehovah's witnesses, while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe that christians should be neutral in international conflicts.
every male citizen of the republic of austria up to the age of 35 can be drafted for a six-month long basic military training in the bundesheer. for men refusing to undergo this training, a nine-month lasting community service is mandatory.
belgium abolished the conscription in 1994. the last conscripts left active service in february 1995. to this day (2019), a strong minority of the belgian citizens (especially in flanders) supports the idea of reintroducing military conscription, for both men and women.
bulgaria had mandatory military service for males above 18 until conscription was ended in 2008. due to a shortfall in the army of some 5500 soldiers, parts of the current ruling coalition have expressed their support for the return of mandatory military service, most notably krasimir karakachanov. opposition towards this idea from the main coalition partner, gerb, has seen a compromise, where instead of mandatory military service, bulgaria could possibly introduce a voluntary military service by 2019 where young citizens can volunteer for a period of 6 to 9 months, and will receive a basic wage.
universal conscription in china dates back to the state of qin, which eventually became the qin empire of 221 bc. following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the great wall of china.
in the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.
, universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the people's republic of china, and reinforced by law. however, due to the large population of china and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the people's liberation army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice at all.
military service in the cypriot national guard is mandatory for all male citizens of the republic of cyprus, as well as any male non-citizens born of a parent of greek cypriot descent, lasting from the january 1 of the year in which they turn 18 years of age to december 31, of the year in which they turn 50. (efthymiou, 2016). all male residents of cyprus who are of military age (16 and over) are required to obtain an exit visa from the ministry of defense. currently, military conscription in cyprus lasts 14 months.
conscription is known in denmark since the viking age, where one man out of every 10 had to serve the king. frederick iv of denmark changed the law in 1710 to every 4th man. the men were chosen by the landowner and it was seen as a penalty.
since 12 february 1849, every physically fit man must do military service. according to §81 in the constitution of denmark, which was promulgated in 1849: every male person able to carry arms shall be liable with his person to contribute to the defence of his country under such rules as are laid down by statute. — constitution of denmarkthe legislation about compulsory military service is articulated in the danish law of conscription. national service takes 4–12 months. it is possible to postpone the duty when one is still in full-time education. every male turning 18 will be drafted to the 'day of defence', where they will be introduced to the danish military and their health will be tested. physically unfit persons are not required to do military service. it is only compulsory for men, while women are free to choose to join the danish army. almost all of the men have been volunteers in recent years, 96.9% of the total number of recruits having been volunteers in the 2015 draft.
after lottery, one can become a conscientious objector. total objection (refusal from alternative civilian service) results in up to 4 months jailtime according to the law. however, in 2014 a danish man, who signed up for the service and objected later, got only 14 days of home arrest. in many countries the act of desertion (objection after signing up) is punished harder than objecting the compulsory service.
conscription in finland is part of a general compulsion for national military service for all adult males (; ) defined in the 127§ of the constitution of finland.
conscription can take the form of military or of civilian service. according to finnish defence forces 2011 data slightly under 80% of finnish males turned 30 had entered and finished the military service. the number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300. the service period is 165, 255 or 347 days for the rank and file conscripts and 347 days for conscripts trained as ncos or reserve officers. the length of civilian service is always twelve months. those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.
any finnish male citizen who refuses to perform both military and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days. such sentences are usually served fully in prison, with no parole. jehovah's witnesses are exempted in that they may be granted a deferment of service for 3 years upon presentation of a certificate from their congregation's minister showing they are an active member of that religious community. providing they are still an active member 3 years later, there is nothing to stop them getting a further certificate and deferment. the inhabitants of the demilitarized åland islands are exempt from military service. by the conscription act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. however, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. the non-military service of åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. the inhabitants of åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. as of 1995, women are permitted to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.
the military service takes place in finnish defence forces or in the finnish border guard. all services of the finnish defence forces train conscripts. however, the border guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the border guard air wing. civilian service may take place in the civilian service center in lapinjärvi or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.
between 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the german federal armed forces (german: "bundeswehr"), as well as for the federal border guard (german: "bundesgrenzschutz ") in the 1970s (see border guard service). with the end of the cold war the german government drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. the low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ""bundeswehr.
since 1914, greece has had a period of mandatory military service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1–10 days at irregular intervals.
universal conscription was introduced in greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. in more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on july 20, 1974 due to the crisis in cyprus (the mobilisation was formally ended on december 18, 2002).
the period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. although women are employed by the greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.
since 2009, greece has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. however, as the armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. however, this timetable was under reconsideration as of april 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. these had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. in august 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. the number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.
there is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:
all of the above can choose to volunteer to the idf. relatively large numbers of bedouin choose to volunteer.
male druze and circassian israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (female druze and circassian are exempt from service).
lithuania abolished its conscription in 2008. in may 2015 the lithuanian parliament voted to return the conscription and the conscripts started their training in august 2015. in practice there is no conscription in lithuania, since all recruits have been volunteers.
luxembourg practiced military conscription from 1948 until 1967.
moldova, which currently has male conscription, has announced plans to abolish the practice. moldova's defense ministry announced that a plan which stipulates the gradual elimination of military conscription will be implemented starting from the autumn of 2018.
conscription, which was called "service duty" () in the netherlands, was first employed in 1810 by french occupying forces. napoleon's brother louis bonaparte, who was king of holland from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. by means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the french army. it was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.
later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. postponement was possible, due to study, for example. conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. for various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. since the cold war was over, so was the direct threat of a war. instead, the dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. the complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.
in the european part of netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 may 1997. between 1991 and 1996, the dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. the last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. the suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. since then, the dutch army has become an all-professional force. however, to this day, every male and female citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service.
, norway currently employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women. in practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected. about 60,000 norwegians are available for conscription every year, but only 8,000 to 10,000 are conscripted. since 1985, women have been able to enlist for voluntary service as regular recruits. on 14 june 2013 the norwegian parliament voted to extend conscription to women, making norway the first nato member and first european country to make national service compulsory for both sexes. in earlier times, up until at least the early 2000s, all men aged 19–44 were subject to mandatory service, with good reasons required to avoid becoming drafted. there is a right of conscientious objection.
in addition to the military service, the norwegian government draft a total of 8,000 men and women between 18 and 55 to non-military civil defence duty. (not to be confused with alternative civilian service.) former service in the military does not exclude anyone from later being drafted to the civil defence, but an upper limit of total 19 months of service applies. neglecting mobilisation orders to training exercises and actual incidents, may impose fines.
, serbia no longer practises mandatory military service. prior to this, mandatory military service lasted 6 months for men. conscientious objectors could however opt for 9 months of civil service instead.
on 15 december 2010, the parliament of serbia voted to suspend mandatory military service. the decision fully came into force on january 1, 2011.
sweden had conscription () for men between 1901 and 2010. during the last few decades it was selective. since 1980, women have been allowed to sign up by choice, and, if passing the tests, do military training together with male conscripts. since 1989 women have been allowed to serve in all military positions and units, including combat.
in 2010, conscription was made gender-neutral, meaning both women and men would be conscripted –on equal terms. the conscription system was simultaneously deactivated in peacetime. seven years later, referencing increased military threat, the swedish government reactivated military conscription. beginning in 2018, both men and women are conscripted.
the united kingdom introduced conscription to full-time military service for the first time in january 1916 (the eighteenth month of world war i) and abolished it in 1920. ireland, then part of the united kingdom, was exempted from the original 1916 military service legislation, and although further legislation in 1918 gave power for an extension of conscription to ireland, the power was never put into effect.
conscription was reintroduced in 1939, in the lead up to world war ii, and continued in force until 1963. northern ireland was exempted from conscription legislation throughout the whole period.
in all, eight million men were conscripted during both world wars, as well as several hundred thousand younger single women. the introduction of conscription in may 1939, before the war began, was partly due to pressure from the french, who emphasized the need for a large british army to oppose the germans. from early 1942 unmarried women age 19–30 were conscripted. most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the auxiliary territorial service (ats) and other women's services. some women served in the women's land army: initially volunteers but later conscription was introduced. however, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a general post office telephonist, were told to continue working as before. none was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. by 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. during the second world war, 1.4 million british men volunteered for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. conscripts comprised 50% of the royal air force, 60% of the royal navy and 80% of the british army.
britain and its colonies did not develop such pervasive administrative states, and therefore did not opt out for regulatory solutions, such as conscription, as a reliability. the abolition of conscription in britain was announced on 4 april 1957, by new prime minister harold macmillan, with the last conscripts being recruited three years later.
conscription in the united states ended in 1973, but males aged between 18 and 25 are required to register with the selective service system to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary. president gerald ford had suspended mandatory draft registration in 1975; but, president jimmy carter reinstated that requirement when the soviet union intervened in afghanistan five years later. consequently, selective service registration is still required of almost all young men. there have been no prosecutions for violations of the draft registration law since 1986. males between the ages of 17 and 45, and female members of the us national guard may be conscripted for federal militia service pursuant to 10 u.s. code § 246 and the militia clauses of the united states constitution.
in february 2019, the united states district court for the southern district of texas ruled that male-only conscription breached the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause. in "national coalition for men v. selective service system", a case brought by non-profit men's rights organisation the national coalition for men against the u.s. selective service system, judge gray h. miller issued a declaratory judgement that the male-only registration requirement is unconstitutional, though did not specify what action the government should take.

catherine grace "cady" coleman (born december 14, 1960) is an american chemist, a former united states air force officer, and a retired nasa astronaut. she is a veteran of two space shuttle missions, and departed the international space station on may 23, 2011, as a crew member of expedition 27 after logging 159 days in space.
coleman graduated from wilbert tucker woodson high school, fairfax, virginia, in 1978; in 1978–1979, she was an exchange student at røyken upper secondary school in norway with the afs intercultural programs. she received a b.s. degree in chemistry from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1983, and a ph.d. degree in polymer science and engineering from the university of massachusetts amherst in 1991 as a member of the air force rotc. she was advised by professor thomas j. mccarthy on her doctorate. she was a member of the intercollegiate crew and was a resident of baker house.
after completing her regular education, coleman joined the u.s. air force as a second lieutenant while continuing her graduate work for a phd at the university of massachusetts amherst. in 1988 she entered active duty at wright-patterson air force base as a research chemist. during her work she participated as a surface analysis consultant on the nasa long duration exposure facility experiment. in 1991, she received her doctorate in polymer science and engineering. she retired from the air force in november 2009 as a colonel.
coleman was selected by nasa in 1992 to join the nasa astronaut corps. in 1995, she was a member of the sts-73 crew on the scientific mission usml-2 with experiments including biotechnology, combustion science, and the physics of fluids. during the flight, she reported to houston mission control that she had spotted an unidentified flying object. she also trained for the mission sts-83 to be the backup for donald a. thomas; however, as he recovered on time, she did not fly that mission. sts-93 was coleman's second space flight in 1999. she was mission specialist in charge of deploying the chandra x-ray observatory and its inertial upper stage out of the shuttle's cargo bay.
coleman served as chief of robotics for the astronaut office, to include robotic arm operations and training for all space shuttle and international space station missions. in october 2004, coleman served as an aquanaut during the mission aboard the aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.
coleman was assigned as a backup u.s. crew member for expeditions 19, 20 and 21 and served as a backup crew member for expeditions 24 and 25 as part of her training for expedition 26.
coleman launched on december 15, 2010 (december 16 baikonur time), aboard soyuz tma-20 to join the expedition 26 mission aboard the international space station. she retired from nasa on december 1, 2016.
sts-73 on space shuttle "columbia" (october 20 to november 5, 1995) was the second united states microgravity laboratory mission. the mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, the physics of fluids, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized spacelab module. in completing her first space flight, coleman orbited the earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.
sts-93 on "columbia" (july 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the chandra x-ray observatory. designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the universe, the telescope will enable scientists to study exotic phenomena such as exploding stars, quasars, and black holes. mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.
soyuz tma-20 / expedition 26/27 (december 15, 2010, to may 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the international space station.
coleman is married to glass artist josh simpson who lives in massachusetts. they have one son. she is part of the band bandella, which also includes fellow nasa astronaut steven robinson, canadian astronaut chris hadfield, and micki pettit (astronaut don pettit's wife). coleman is a flute player and has taken several flutes with her to the iss, including a pennywhistle from paddy moloney of the chieftains, an old irish flute from matt molloy of the chieftains, and a flute from ian anderson of jethro tull. on february 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on national public radio. on april 12, 2011, she played live through video link for the audience of jethro tull's show in russia in honour of the 50th anniversary of yuri gagarin's flight. she played the duet from orbit while anderson played on the ground in russia. on may 13 of that year, coleman delivered a taped commencement address to the class of 2011 at the university of massachusetts amherst.
as do many other astronauts, coleman holds an amateur radio license (callsign: kc5zth).
as of 2015, she is also a member of the board of directors for the hollywood science fiction museum.
as of 2015 she is also known to be working as a guest speaker at the baylor college of medicine, for the children's program 'saturday morning science'.
in 2018 she gave a graduation address to carter lynch, the sole graduate of cuttyhunk elementary school, on cuttyhunk island, massachusetts.

the cervix or cervix uteri (latin, 'neck of the uterus') is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system. the cervix is usually 2 to 3 cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape, which changes during pregnancy. the narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. the opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. the lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. the cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of hippocrates, over 2,000 years ago.
the cervical canal is a passage through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms, aim to block or prevent the passage of sperm through the cervical canal. cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the creighton model and billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. during vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. midwives and doctors use the extent of the dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.
the cervical canal is lined with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. the two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. infection with the human papillomavirus (hpv) can cause changes in the epithelium, which can lead to cancer of the cervix. cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. ways to avoid hpv include avoiding sex, using condoms, and hpv vaccination. hpv vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of hpv.
the cervix is part of the female reproductive system. around in length, it is the lower narrower part of the uterus continuous above with the broader upper part—or body—of the uterus. the lower end of the cervix bulges through the anterior wall of the vagina, and is referred to as the vaginal portion of cervix (or ectocervix) while the rest of the cervix above the vagina is called the supravaginal portion of cervix. a central canal, known as the cervical canal, runs along its length and connects the cavity of the body of the uterus with the lumen of the vagina. the openings are known as the internal os and external orifice of the uterus (or external os) respectively. the mucosa lining the cervical canal is known as the endocervix, and the mucosa covering the ectocervix is known as the exocervix. the cervix has an inner mucosal layer, a thick layer of smooth muscle, and posteriorly the supravaginal portion has a serosal covering consisting of connective tissue and overlying peritoneum.
in front of the upper part of the cervix lies the bladder, separated from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. to the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. the cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.
the cervical canal varies greatly in length and width between women or over the course of a woman's life, and it can measure 8 mm (0.3 inch) at its widest diameter in premenopausal adults. it is wider in the middle and narrower at each end. the anterior and posterior walls of the canal each have a vertical fold, from which ridges run diagonally upwards and laterally. these are known as "palmate folds", due to their resemblance to a palm leaf. the anterior and posterior ridges are arranged in such a way that they interlock with each other and close the canal. they are often effaced after pregnancy.
the ectocervix (also known as the vaginal portion of the cervix) has a convex, elliptical shape and projects into the cervix between the anterior and posterior vaginal fornices. on the rounded part of the ectocervix is a small, depressed external opening, connecting the cervix with the vagina. the size and shape of the ectocervix and the external opening (external os) can vary according to age, hormonal state, and whether natural or normal childbirth has taken place. in women who have not had a vaginal delivery, the external opening is small and circular, and in women who have had a vaginal delivery, it is slit-like. on average, the ectocervix is long and wide.
blood is supplied to the cervix by the descending branch of the uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. the pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as s2–s3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. these nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.
three channels facilitate lymphatic drainage from the cervix. the anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments at the base of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. the posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. however, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. this has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.
after menstruation and directly under the influence of estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. during most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. however, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. these changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.
as a component of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. during development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. the cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. the point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. new studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.
the endocervical mucosa is about thick, lined with a single layer of columnar mucous cells, and contains numerous tubular mucous glands which empty viscous alkaline mucus into the lumen. in contrast, the ectocervix is covered with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which resembles the squamous epithelium lining the vaginal. the junction between these two types of epithelia is called the squamocolumnar junction. underlying both types of epithelium is a tough layer of collagen. the mucosa of the endocervix is not shed during menstruation. the cervix has more fibrous tissue, including collagen and elastin, than the rest of the uterus.
in prepubertal girls, the functional squamocolumnar junction is present just within the cervical canal. upon entering puberty, due to hormonal influence, and during pregnancy, the columnar epithelium extends outwards over the ectocervix as the cervix everts. hence, this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal portion of the cervix, where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment. the exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher metaplastic squamous epithelium in days or weeks, which is very similar to the original squamous epithelium when mature. the new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction, and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the transformation zone of the cervix. after menopause, the uterine structures involute and the functional squamocolumnar junction moves into the cervical canal.
nabothian cysts (or nabothian follicles) form in the transformation zone where the lining of metaplastic epithelium has replaced mucous epithelium and caused a strangulation of the outlet of some of the mucous glands. a buildup of mucus in the glands forms nabothian cysts, usually less than about in diameter, which are considered physiological rather than pathological. both gland openings and nabothian cysts are helpful to identify the transformation zone.
the cervical canal is a pathway through which sperm enter the uterus after sexual intercourse, and some forms of artificial insemination. some sperm remains in cervical crypts, infoldings of the endocervix, which act as a reservoir, releasing sperm over several hours and maximising the chances of fertilisation. a theory states the cervical and uterine contractions during orgasm draw semen into the uterus. although the "upsuck theory" has been generally accepted for some years, it has been disputed due to lack of evidence, small sample size, and methodological errors.
some methods of fertility awareness, such as the creighton model and the billings method involve estimating a woman's periods of fertility and infertility by observing physiological changes in her body. among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity ("spinnbarkeit"), its transparency, and the presence of ferning.
several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60 mg of cervical mucus a day, increasing to 600 mg around the time of ovulation. it is viscous because it contains large proteins known as mucins. the viscosity and water content varies during the menstrual cycle; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. these changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. it contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as amylase; and prostaglandins. its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. at midcycle around the time of ovulation—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus, and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm. it is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the "ferning" pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern. the mucus has stretchy character described as "spinnbarkeit" most prominent around the time of ovulation.
at other times in the cycle, the mucus is thick and more acidic due to the effects of progesterone. this "infertile" mucus acts as a barrier to sperm from entering the uterus. women taking an oral contraceptive pill also have thick mucus from the effects of progesterone. thick mucus also prevents pathogens from interfering with a nascent pregnancy.
a cervical mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. this provides a protective seal for the uterus against the entry of pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. the mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. this plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during the first stage of childbirth or shortly before. it is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.
the cervix plays a major role in childbirth. as the fetus descends within the uterus in preparation for birth, the presenting part, usually the head, rests on and is supported by the cervix. as labour progresses, the cervix becomes softer and shorter, begins to dilate, and rotates to face anteriorly. the support the cervix provides to the fetal head starts to give way when the uterus begins its contractions. during childbirth, the cervix must dilate to a diameter of more than to accommodate the head of the fetus as it descends from the uterus to the vagina. in becoming wider, the cervix also becomes shorter, a phenomenon known as effacement.
along with other factors, midwives and doctors use the extent of cervical dilation to assist decision making during childbirth. generally, the active first stage of labour, when the uterine contractions become strong and regular, begins when the cervical dilation is more than . the second phase of labor begins when the cervix has dilated to , which is regarded as its fullest dilation, and is when active pushing and contractions push the baby along the birth canal leading to the birth of the baby. the number of past vaginal deliveries is a strong factor in influencing how rapidly the cervix is able to dilate in labour. the time taken for the cervix to dilate and efface is one factor used in reporting systems such as the bishop score, used to recommend whether interventions such as a forceps delivery, induction, or caesarean section should be used in childbirth.
cervical incompetence is a condition in which shortening of the cervix due to dilation and thinning occurs, before term pregnancy. short cervical length is the strongest predictor of preterm birth.
several methods of contraception involve the cervix. cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted by a woman prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. pressure against the walls of the vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. in one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. in addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. in contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. they also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.
in 2008, cervical cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically from less than one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. it is a leading cause of cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. the introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) cervical cancer, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.
cervical cancer nearly always involves human papillomavirus (hpv) infection. hpv is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous changes in the cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, which is the most common area for cervical cancer to start. hpv vaccines, such as gardasil and cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.
potentially precancerous changes in the cervix can be detected by cervical screening, using methods including a pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped from the surface of the cervix and examined under a microscope. the colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. the pap smear was developed by georgios papanikolaou in 1928. a leep procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by aurel babes in 1927. in some parts of the developed world including the uk, the pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.
a cheap, cost-effective and practical alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (via). instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs in these regions can be difficult, due to the need for trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. with via, results and treatment can be available on the same day. as a screening test, via is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.
a result of dysplasia is usually further investigated, such as by taking a cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer. most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. when symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.
inflammation of the cervix is referred to as cervicitis. this inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. when associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. as many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. when associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. if the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.
cervical stenosis is an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated with the development of cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance, which is the condition wherein, as the name suggests, the cervix of the uterus is shaped like a cockscomb. about one third of women born to diethylstilbestrol-treated mothers (i.e. in-utero exposure) develop a cockscomb cervix.
enlarged folds or ridges of cervical stroma (fibrous tissues) and epithelium constitute a cockscomb cervix. similarly, cockscomb polyps lining the cervix are usually considered or grouped into the same overarching description. it is in and of itself considered a benign abnormality; its presence, however is usually indicative of des exposure, and as such women who experience these abnormalities should be aware of their increased risk of associated pathologies.
cervical agenesis is a rare congenital condition in which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. the cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.
cervical polyps, which are benign overgrowths of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth may be present in the cervical canal. cervical ectropion refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.
female marsupials have paired uteri and cervices. most eutherian (placental) mammal species have a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade glires. anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they are thought to have lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage. in domestic pigs, the cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads that hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation.
the word "cervix" () came to english from latin, where it means "neck", and like its germanic counterpart, it can refer not only to the neck [of the body] but also to an analogous narrowed part of an object. the cervix uteri (neck of the uterus) is thus the uterine cervix, but in english the word "cervix" used alone usually refers to it. thus the adjective "cervical" may refer either to the neck (as in "cervical vertebrae" or "cervical lymph nodes") or to the uterine cervix (as in "cervical cap" or "cervical cancer").
latin "cervix" came from the proto-indo-european root "ker-", referring to a "structure that projects". thus, the word cervix is linguistically related to the english word "horn", the persian word for "head" ( "sar"), the greek word for "head" ( "koruphe"), and the welsh word for "deer" ().
the cervix was documented in anatomical literature in at least the time of hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both hippocrates and aretaeus. however, there was some variation in word sense among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice. the first attested use of the word to refer to the cervix of the uterus was in 1702.

a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). the name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.
however, there are many different types of compilers. if the compiled program can run on a computer whose cpu or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. a bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. a program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. a program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. a language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. the term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.
a compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.
compilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs. an interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations. the translation process influences the design of computer languages which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. in practice, an interpreter can be implemented for compiled languages and compilers can be implemented for interpreted languages.
theoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during world war ii. primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. in the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures. limited memory capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. the front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. as computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.
it is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, so the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by digital computers. high-level languages are formal languages that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. elements of these formal languages include:
the sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.
backus–naur form (bnf) describes the syntax of "sentences" of a language and was used for the syntax of algol 60 by john backus. the ideas derive from the context-free grammar concepts by noam chomsky, a linguist. "bnf and its extensions have become standard tools for describing the syntax of programming notations, and in many cases parts of compilers are generated automatically from a bnf description."
in the 1940s, konrad zuse designed an algorithmic programming language called plankalkül ("plan calculus"). while no actual implementation occurred until the 1970s, it presented concepts later seen in apl designed by ken iverson in the late 1950s. apl is a language for mathematical computations.
high-level language design during the formative years of digital computing provided useful programming tools for a variety of applications:
compiler technology evolved from the need for a strictly defined transformation of the high-level source program into a low-level target program for the digital computer. the compiler could be viewed as a front end to deal with the analysis of the source code and a back end to synthesize the analysis into the target code. optimization between the front end and back end could produce more efficient target code.
some early milestones in the development of compiler technology:
early operating systems and software were written in assembly language. in the 60s and early 70s, the use of high-level languages for system programming was still controversial due to resource limitations. however, several research and industry efforts began the shift toward high-level systems programming languages, for example, bcpl, bliss, b, and c.
bcpl (basic combined programming language) designed in 1966 by martin richards at the university of cambridge was originally developed as a compiler writing tool. several compilers have been implemented, richards' book provides insights to the language and its compiler. bcpl was not only an influential systems programming language that is still used in research but also provided a basis for the design of b and c languages.
bliss (basic language for implementation of system software) was developed for a digital equipment corporation (dec) pdp-10 computer by w.a. wulf's carnegie mellon university (cmu) research team. the cmu team went on to develop bliss-11 compiler one year later in 1970.
multics (multiplexed information and computing service), a time-sharing operating system project, involved mit, bell labs, general electric (later honeywell) and was led by fernando corbató from mit. multics was written in the pl/i language developed by ibm and ibm user group. ibm's goal was to satisfy business, scientific, and systems programming requirements. there were other languages that could have been considered but pl/i offered the most complete solution even though it had not been implemented. for the first few years of the mulitics project, a subset of the language could be compiled to assembly language with the early pl/i (epl) compiler by doug mcilory and bob morris from bell labs. epl supported the project until a boot-strapping compiler for the full pl/i could be developed.
bell labs left the multics project in 1969: "over time, hope was replaced by frustration as the group effort initially failed to produce an economically useful system." continued participation would drive up project support costs. so researchers turned to other development efforts. a system programming language b based on bcpl concepts was written by dennis ritchie and ken thompson. ritchie created a boot-strapping compiler for b and wrote unics (uniplexed information and computing service) operating system for a pdp-7 in b. unics eventually became spelled unix.
bell labs started development and expansion of c based on b and bcpl. the bcpl compiler had been transported to multics by bell labs and bcpl was a preferred language at bell labs. initially, a front-end program to bell labs' b compiler was used while a c compiler was developed. in 1971, a new pdp-11 provided the resource to define extensions to b and rewrite the compiler. by 1973 the design of c language was essentially complete and the unix kernel for a pdp-11 was rewritten in c. steve johnson started development of portable c compiler (pcc) to support retargeting of c compilers to new machines.
object-oriented programming (oop) offered some interesting possibilities for application development and maintenance. oop concepts go further back but were part of lisp and simula language science. at bell labs, the development of c++ became interested in oop. c++ was first used in 1980 for systems programming. the initial design leveraged c language systems programming capabilities with simula concepts. object-oriented facilities were added in 1983. the cfront program implemented a c++ front-end for c84 language compiler. in subsequent years several c++ compilers were developed as c++ popularity grew.
in many application domains, the idea of using a higher-level language quickly caught on. because of the expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers became more complex.
darpa (defense advanced research projects agency) sponsored a compiler project with wulf's cmu research team in 1970. the production quality compiler-compiler pqcc design would produce a production quality compiler (pqc) from formal definitions of source language and the target. pqcc tried to extend the term compiler-compiler beyond the traditional meaning as a parser generator (e.g., yacc) without much success. pqcc might more properly be referred to as a compiler generator.
pqcc research into code generation process sought to build a truly automatic compiler-writing system. the effort discovered and designed the phase structure of the pqc. the bliss-11 compiler provided the initial structure. the phases included analyses (front end), intermediate translation to virtual machine (middle end), and translation to the target (back end). tcol was developed for the pqcc research to handle language specific constructs in the intermediate representation. variations of tcol supported various languages. the pqcc project investigated techniques of automated compiler construction. the design concepts proved useful in optimizing compilers and compilers for the object-oriented programming language ada.
the ada stoneman document formalized the program support environment (apse) along with the kernel (kapse) and minimal (mapse). an ada interpreter nyu/ed supported development and standardization efforts with the american national standards institute (ansi) and the international standards organization (iso). initial ada compiler development by the u.s. military services included the compilers in a complete integrated design environment along the lines of the stoneman document. army and navy worked on the ada language system (als) project targeted to dec/vax architecture while the air force started on the ada integrated environment (aie) targeted to ibm 370 series. while the projects did not provide the desired results, they did contribute to the overal effort on ada development.
other ada compiler efforts got underway in britain at the university of york and in germany at the university of karlsruhe. in the u. s., verdix (later acquired by rational) delivered the verdix ada development system (vads) to the army. vads provided a set of development tools including a compiler. unix/vads could be hosted on a variety of unix platforms such as dec ultrix and the sun 3/60 solaris targeted to motorola 68020 in an army cecom evaluation. there were soon many ada compilers available that passed the ada validation tests. the free software foundation gnu project developed the gnu compiler collection (gcc) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. the ada version gnat is one of the most widely used ada compilers. gnat is free but there is also commercial support, for example, adacore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for ada. gnat pro includes the gnu gcc based gnat with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.
high-level languages continued to drive compiler research and development. focus areas included optimization and automatic code generation. trends in programming languages and development environments influenced compiler technology. more compilers became included in language distributions (perl, java development kit) and as a component of an ide (vads, eclipse, ada pro). the interrelationship and interdependence of technologies grew. the advent of web services promoted growth of web languages and scripting languages. scripts trace back to the early days of command line interfaces (cli) where the user could enter commands to be executed by the system. user shell concepts developed with languages to write shell programs. early windows designs offered a simple batch programming capability. the conventional transformation of these language used an interpreter. while not widely used, bash and batch compilers have been written. more recently sophisticated interpreted languages became part of the developers tool kit. modern scripting languages include php, python, ruby and lua. (lua is widely used in game development.) all of these have interpreter and compiler support.
"when the field of compiling began in the late 50s, its focus was limited to the translation of high-level language programs into machine code ... the compiler field is increasingly intertwined with other disciplines including computer architecture, programming languages, formal methods, software engineering, and computer security." the "compiler research: the next 50 years" article noted the importance of object-oriented languages and java. security and parallel computing were cited among the future research targets.
a compiler implements a formal transformation from a high-level source program to a low-level target program. compiler design can define an end to end solution or tackle a defined subset that interfaces with other compilation tools e.g. preprocessors, assemblers, linkers. design requirements include rigorously defined interfaces both internally between compiler components and externally between supporting toolsets.
in the early days, the approach taken to compiler design was directly affected by the complexity of the computer language to be processed, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available. resource limitations led to the need to pass through the source code more than once.
a compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software. however, as the source language grows in complexity the design may be split into a number of interdependent phases. separate phases provide design improvements that focus development on the functions in the compilation process.
classifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers. compiling involves performing lots of work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work. so compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.
the ability to compile in a single pass has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster than multi-pass compilers. thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., pascal).
in some cases the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source. for instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10. in this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.
the disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated optimizations needed to generate high quality code. it can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes. for instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.
splitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers. proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.
regardless of the exact number of phases in the compiler design, the phases can be assigned to one of three stages. the stages include a front end, a middle end, and a back end.
this front/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different cpus while sharing the optimizations of the middle end. practical examples of this approach are the gnu compiler collection, llvm, and the amsterdam compiler kit, which have multiple front-ends, shared optimizations and multiple back-ends.
the front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the intermediate representation (ir). it also manages the symbol table, a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.
while the frontend can be a single monolithic function or program, as in a scannerless parser, it is more commonly implemented and analyzed as several phases, which may execute sequentially or concurrently. this method is favored due to its modularity and separation of concerns. most commonly today, the frontend is broken into three phases: lexical analysis (also known as lexing), syntax analysis (also known as scanning or parsing), and semantic analysis. lexing and parsing comprise the syntactic analysis (word syntax and phrase syntax, respectively), and in simple cases these modules (the lexer and parser) can be automatically generated from a grammar for the language, though in more complex cases these require manual modification. the lexical grammar and phrase grammar are usually context-free grammars, which simplifies analysis significantly, with context-sensitivity handled at the semantic analysis phase. the semantic analysis phase is generally more complex and written by hand, but can be partially or fully automated using attribute grammars. these phases themselves can be further broken down: lexing as scanning and evaluating, and parsing as building a concrete syntax tree (cst, parse tree) and then transforming it into an abstract syntax tree (ast, syntax tree). in some cases additional phases are used, notably "line reconstruction" and "preprocessing," but these are rare.
the main phases of the front end include the following:
the middle end, also known as "optimizer," performs optimizations on the intermediate representation in order to improve the performance and the quality of the produced machine code. the middle end contains those optimizations that are independent of the cpu architecture being targeted.
the main phases of the middle end include the following:
compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. for example, dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation.
the scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly; their scope may range from operating within a basic block, to whole procedures, or even the whole program. there is a trade-off between the granularity of the optimizations and the cost of compilation. for example, peephole optimizations are fast to perform during compilation but only affect a small local fragment of the code, and can be performed independently of the context in which the code fragment appears. in contrast, interprocedural optimization requires more compilation time and memory space, but enable optimizations which are only possible by considering the behavior of multiple functions simultaneously.
interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from hp, ibm, sgi, intel, microsoft, and sun microsystems. the free software gcc was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is open64, which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.
due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.
the back end is responsible for the cpu architecture specific optimizations and for code generation"."
the main phases of the back end include the following:
compiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification. techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.
higher-level programming languages usually appear with a type of translation in mind: either designed as compiled language or interpreted language. however, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that "requires" it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. the categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language — for instance, basic is sometimes called an interpreted language, and c a compiled one, despite the existence of basic compilers and c interpreters.
interpretation does not replace compilation completely. it only hides it from the user and makes it gradual. even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted, a directly executed program is needed somewhere at the bottom of the stack (see machine language).
further, compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons. for example, where an expression can be executed during compilation and the results inserted into the output program, then it prevents it having to be recalculated each time the program runs, which can greatly speed up the final program. modern trends toward just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters even further.
some language specifications spell out that implementations "must" include a compilation facility; for example, common lisp. however, there is nothing inherent in the definition of common lisp that stops it from being interpreted. other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, apl, snobol4, and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. to implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself.
one classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes. this is known as the "target platform."
a "native" or "hosted" compiler is one whose output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. the output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform. cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment.
the output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine (vm) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it. for this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.
the lower level language that is the target of a compiler may itself be a high-level programming language. c, viewed by some as a sort of portable assembly language, is frequently the target language of such compilers. for example, cfront, the original compiler for c++, used c as its target language. the c code generated by such a compiler is usually not intended to be readable and maintained by humans, so indent style and creating pretty c intermediate code are ignored. some of the features of c that make it a good target language include the codice_1 directive, which can be generated by the compiler to support debugging of the original source, and the wide platform support available with c compilers.
while a common compiler type outputs machine code, there are many other types:

a castrato (italian, plural: "castrati") is a type of classical male singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. the voice is produced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.
castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. as a result, the vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in the papal states, the last to prohibit them, in 1870.
as the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. thus the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their ribs. this, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled lung-power and breath capacity. operating through small, child-sized vocal cords, their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice. their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult male. listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a "super-high" tenor, with a more falsetto-like upper register above that.
castrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the euphemism "musico" (pl "musici") was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications; another synonym was "evirato," literally meaning "emasculated". eunuch is a more general term since, historically, many eunuchs were castrated after puberty and thus the castration had no impact on their voices.
castration as a means of subjugation, enslavement or other punishment has a very long history, dating back to ancient sumer. in a western context, eunuch singers are known to have existed from the early byzantine empire. in constantinople around 400 ad, the empress aelia eudoxia had a eunuch choir-master, brison, who may have established the use of castrati in byzantine choirs, though whether brison himself was a singer and whether he had colleagues who were eunuch singers is not certain. by the 9th century, eunuch singers were well-known (not least in the choir of hagia sophia) and remained so until the sack of constantinople by the western forces of the fourth crusade in 1204. their fate from then until their reappearance in italy more than three hundred years later is not clear. it seems likely that the spanish tradition of soprano falsettists may have hidden castrati. much of spain was under muslim rulers during the middle ages, and castration had a history going back to the ancient near east. stereotypically, eunuchs served as harem guards, but they were also valued as high-level political appointees since they could not start a dynasty which would threaten the ruler.
castrati first appeared in italy in the mid-16th century, though at first the terms describing them were not always clear. the phrase "soprano maschio" (male soprano), which could also mean falsettist, occurs in the "due dialoghi della musica" (two dialogues upon music) of luigi dentice, an oratorian priest, published in rome in 1553. on 9 november 1555 cardinal ippolito ii d'este (famed as the builder of the villa d'este at tivoli), wrote to guglielmo gonzaga, duke of mantua (1538–1587), that he has heard that the duke was interested in his "cantoretti" (little singers) and offered to send him two, so that he could choose one for his own service. this is a rare term but probably does equate to "castrato". the cardinal's nephew, alfonso ii d'este, duke of ferrara, was another early enthusiast, enquiring about castrati in 1556. there were certainly castrati in the sistine chapel choir in 1558, although not described as such: on 27 april of that year, hernando bustamante, a spaniard from palencia, was admitted (the first castrati so termed who joined the sistine choir were pietro paolo folignato and girolamo rossini, admitted in 1599). surprisingly, considering the later french distaste for castrati they certainly existed in france at this time also, being known of in paris, orléans, picardy and normandy, though they were not abundant: the king of france himself had difficulty in obtaining them. by 1574, there were castrati in the ducal court chapel at munich, where the kapellmeister (music director) was the famous orlando di lasso. in 1589, by the bull "cum pro nostro pastorali munere", pope sixtus v re-organised the choir of st peter's, rome specifically to include castrati. thus the castrati came to supplant both boys (whose voices broke after only a few years) and falsettists (whose voices were weaker and less reliable) from the top line in such choirs. women were banned by the pauline dictum "mulieres in ecclesiis taceant" ("let women keep silent in the churches"; see i corinthians, ch. 14, v. 34).
although the castrato (or musico) predates opera, there is some evidence that castrati had parts in the earliest operas. in the first performance of monteverdi's "orfeo" (1607), for example, they played subsidiary roles, including speranza and (possibly) that of euridice. although female roles were performed by castrati in some of the papal states, this was increasingly rare; by 1680, they had supplanted "normal" male voices in lead roles, and retained their position as "primo uomo" for about a hundred years; an italian opera not featuring at least one renowned castrato in a lead part would be doomed to fail. because of the popularity of italian opera throughout 18th-century europe (except france), singers such as ferri, farinelli, senesino and pacchierotti became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation. the strictly hierarchical organisation of "opera seria" favoured their high voices as symbols of heroic virtue, though they were frequently mocked for their strange appearance and bad acting. in his 1755 "reflections upon theatrical expression in tragedy", roger pickering wrote:
farinelli drew every body to the haymarket. what a pipe! what modulation! what extasy to the ear! but, heavens! what clumsiness! what stupidity! what offence to the eye! reader, if of the city, thou mayest probably have seen in the fields of islington or mile-end or, if thou art in the environs of st james', thou must have observed in the park with what ease and agility a cow, heavy with calf, has rose up at the command of the milk-woman's foot: thus from the mossy bank sprang the divine farinelli.
the means by which future singers were prepared could lead to premature death. to prevent the child from experiencing the intense pain of castration, many were inadvertently administered lethal doses of opium or some other narcotic, or were killed by overlong compression of the carotid artery in the neck (intended to render them unconscious during the castration procedure).
during the 18th century itself, the music historian charles burney was sent from pillar to post in search of places where "the operation" was carried out:
i enquired throughout italy at what place boys were chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. i was told at milan that it was at venice; at venice that it was at bologna; but at bologna the fact was denied, and i was referred to florence; from florence to rome, and from rome i was sent to naples ... it is said that there are shops in naples with this inscription: 'qui si castrano ragazzi' ("here boys are castrated"); but i was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops during my residence in that city.
the training of the boys was rigorous. the regimen of one singing school in rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence and in front of a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. after, half an hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. during the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. this demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.
in the 1720s and 1730s, at the height of the craze for these voices, it has been estimated that upwards of 4,000 boys were castrated annually in the service of art. many came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty (this was the case with senesino). there are, though, records of some young boys asking to be operated on to preserve their voices (e.g. caffarelli, who was from a wealthy family: his grandmother gave him the income from two vineyards to pay for his studies). caffarelli was also typical of many castrati in being famous for tantrums on and off-stage, and for amorous adventures with noble ladies. some, as described by casanova, preferred gentlemen (noble or otherwise). only a small percentage of boys castrated to preserve their voices had successful careers on the operatic stage; the better "also-rans" sang in cathedral or church choirs, but because of their marked appearance and the ban on their marrying, there was little room for them in society outside a musical context.
the castrati came in for a great amount of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. they were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into homosexuality. there were homosexual castrati, as casanova's accounts of 18th-century italy bear witness. he mentions meeting an abbé whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that "she" was a famous castrato. in rome in 1762 he attended a performance at which the prima donna was a castrato, "the favourite pathic" of cardinal borghese, who dined every evening with his protector. from his behaviour on stage "it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, and probably would not have done so as a woman".
by the late 18th century, changes in operatic taste and social attitudes spelled the end for castrati. they lingered on past the end of the "ancien régime" (which their style of opera parallels), and two of their number, pacchierotti and crescentini, even entranced the iconoclastic napoleon. the last great operatic castrato was giovanni battista velluti (1781–1861), who performed the last operatic castrato role ever written: armando in "il crociato in egitto" by meyerbeer (venice, 1824). soon after this they were replaced definitively as the first men of the operatic stage by a new breed of heroic tenor, as first incarnated by the frenchman gilbert-louis duprez, the earliest so-called "king of the high cs". his successors have included such singers as enrico tamberlik, jean de reszke, francesco tamagno, enrico caruso, giovanni martinelli, beniamino gigli, jussi björling, franco corelli and luciano pavarotti, among others.
after the unification of italy in 1861, castration for musical purposes was officially made illegal (the new italian state had adopted a french legal code which expressly forbade the practice). in 1878, pope leo xiii prohibited the hiring of new castrati by the church: only in the sistine chapel and in other papal basilicas in rome did a few castrati linger. a group photo of the sistine choir taken in 1898 shows that by then only six remained (plus the "direttore perpetuo", the fine soprano castrato domenico mustafà), and in 1902 a ruling was extracted from pope leo that no further castrati should be admitted. the official end to the castrati came on st. cecilia's day, 22 november 1903, when the new pope, pius x, issued his "motu proprio", "tra le sollecitudini" ('amongst the cares'), which contained this instruction: "whenever ... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the church."
the last sistine castrato to survive was alessandro moreschi, the only castrato to have made solo recordings. while an interesting historical record, these discs of his give us only a glimpse of the castrato voice – although he had been renowned as "the angel of rome" at the beginning of his career, some would say he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera. the recording technology of the day was not of modern high quality. he retired officially in march 1913, and died in 1922.
the catholic church's involvement in the castrato phenomenon has long been controversial, and there have recently been calls for it to issue an official apology for its role. as early as 1748, pope benedict xiv tried to ban castrati from churches, but such was their popularity at the time that he realised that doing so might result in a drastic decline in church attendance.
the rumours of another castrato sequestered in the vatican for the personal delectation of the pontiff until as recently as 1959 have been proven false. the singer in question was a pupil of moreschi's, domenico mancini, such a successful imitator of his teacher's voice that even lorenzo perosi, direttore perpetuo of the sistine choir from 1898 to 1956 and a strenuous opponent of the practice of castrato singers, thought he was a castrato. mancini was in fact a moderately skilful falsettist and professional double bass player.
so-called "natural" or "endocrinological castrati" are born with hormonal anomalies, such as klinefelter's syndrome and kallmann's syndrome, or have undergone unusual physical or medical events during their early lives that reproduce the vocal effects of castration without being castrated. basically, a male can retain his child voice if it never changes during puberty. the retained voice can be the treble voice shared by both sexes in childhood and is the same as boy soprano voice. but as evidence shows, many castratos, such as senesino and caffarelli, were actually altos (mezzosoprano) – not sopranos.
jimmy scott, robert crowe and radu marian are examples of this type of high male voice. michael maniaci is somewhat different, in that he has no hormonal or other anomalies, but for some unknown reason, his voice did not "break" in the usual manner, leaving him still able to sing in the soprano register. other uncastrated male adults sing soprano, generally using some form of falsetto but in a much higher range than most countertenors. examples are aris christofellis, jörg waschinski, and ghio nannini.
however, it is believed the castrati possessed more of a tenorial chest register (the aria "navigante che non spera" in leonardo vinci's opera "il medo", written for farinelli, requires notes down to c, 131 hz). similar low-voiced singing can be heard from the jazz vocalist jimmy scott, whose range matches approximately that used by female blues singers. high-pitched singer jordan smith has demonstrated having more of a tenorial chest register.
actor chris colfer has soprano voice. colfer has stated in interviews that when his voice began to change at puberty he sang in a high voice "constantly" in an effort to retain his range. actor and singer alex newell has soprano range. voice actor walter tetley may or may not have been a "castrato"; bill scott, a co-worker of tetley's during their later work in television, once half-jokingly quipped that tetley's mother "had him fixed" to protect the child star's voice-acting career. tetley never personally divulged the exact reason for his condition, which left him with the voice of a preteen boy for his entire adult life.
turkish popular singer cem adrian has the ability to sing from bass to soprano, his vocal folds having been reported to be three times the average length.

a counting-out game is a simple game intended to select a person to be "it", often for the purpose of playing another game. these games usually require no materials, and are played with spoken words (counting rhymes) or hand gestures. the historian henry carrington bolton suggested in his 1888 book "counting out rhymes of children" that the custom of counting out originated in the "superstitious practice of divination by lot."
many such games involve one person pointing at each participant in a circle of players while reciting a rhyme. a new person is pointed at as each word is said. the player who is selected at the conclusion of the rhyme is "it" or "out". in an alternate version, the circle of players may each put two feet in and at the conclusion of the rhyme, that player removes one foot and the rhyme starts over with the next person. in this case, the first player that has both feet removed is "it" or "out". in theory a counting rhyme is determined entirely by the starting selection (and would result in a modulo operation), but in practice they are often accepted as random selections because the number of words has not been calculated beforehand, so the result is unknown until someone is selected.
a variant of counting-out game, known as the josephus problem, represents a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science.
several simple games can be played to select one person from a group, either as a straightforward winner, or as someone who is eliminated. rock, paper, scissors, odd or even and blue shoe require no materials and are played using hand gestures, although with the former it is possible for a player to win or lose through skill rather than luck. coin flipping and drawing straws are fair methods of randomly determining a player. bizz buzz is a spoken word game where if a player slips up and speaks a word out of sequence, they are eliminated.
a scene in the marx brothers movie "duck soup" plays on the fact that counting-out games are not really random. faced with selecting someone to go on a dangerous mission, the character chicolini (chico marx) chants:
only to stop as he realizes he is about to select himself. he then says, "i did it wrong. wait, wait, i start here", and repeats the chant—with the same result. after that, he says, "that's no good too. i got it!" and reduces the chant to
and with this version he finally manages to "randomly" select someone else.

in cryptography, key size or key length is the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm (such as a cipher).
key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security (i.e., a logarithmic measure of the fastest known attack against an algorithm, relative to the key length), since the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute-force attacks. ideally, key length would coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security. indeed, most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have security equal to their key length. however, after design, a new attack might be discovered. for instance, triple des was designed to have a 168 bit key, but an attack of complexity 2 is now known (i.e., triple des has 112 bits of security). nevertheless, as long as the relation between key length and security is sufficient for a particular application, then it doesn't matter if key length and security coincide. this is important for asymmetric-key algorithms, because no such algorithm is known to satisfy this property; elliptic curve cryptography comes the closest with an effective security of roughly half its key length.
keys are used to control the operation of a cipher so that only the correct key can convert encrypted text (ciphertext) to plaintext. many ciphers are actually based on publicly known algorithms or are open source and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e., a 'structural weakness' in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). the widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by auguste kerckhoffs (in the 1880s) and claude shannon (in the 1940s); the statements are known as kerckhoffs' principle and shannon's maxim respectively.
a key should therefore be large enough that a brute-force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible – i.e., would take too long to execute. shannon's work on information theory showed that to achieve so called "perfect secrecy", the key length must be at least as large as the message and only used once (this algorithm is called the one-time pad). in light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on "computational security", under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker.
encryption systems are often grouped into families. common families include symmetric systems (e.g. aes) and asymmetric systems (e.g. rsa); they may alternatively be grouped according to the central algorithm used (e.g. elliptic curve cryptography).
as each of these is of a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same level of security, depending upon the algorithm used. for example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric rsa is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm.
the actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. for this reason cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. for example, , a 1039 bit integer was factored with the special number field sieve using 400 computers over 11 months. the factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on rsa keys. the computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit rsa key. however, this might be an advance warning that 1024 bit rsa used in secure online commerce should be deprecated, since they may become breakable in the near future. cryptography professor arjen lenstra observed that "last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a nonspecial, hard-to-factor number" and when asked whether 1024-bit rsa keys are dead, said: "the answer to that question is an unqualified yes."
the 2015 logjam attack revealed additional dangers in using diffie-helman key exchange when only one or a few common 1024-bit or smaller prime moduli are in use. this common practice allows large amounts of communications to be compromised at the expense of attacking a small number of primes.
even if a symmetric cipher is currently unbreakable by exploiting structural weaknesses in its algorithm, it is possible to run through the entire space of keys in what is known as a "brute-force attack". since longer symmetric keys require exponentially more work to brute force search, a sufficiently long symmetric key makes this line of attack impractical.
with a key of length "n" bits, there are 2 possible keys. this number grows very rapidly as "n" increases. the large number of operations (2) required to try all possible 128-bit keys is widely considered out of reach for conventional digital computing techniques for the foreseeable future. however, experts anticipate alternative computing technologies that may have processing power superior to current computer technology. if a suitably sized quantum computer capable of running grover's algorithm reliably becomes available, it would reduce a 128-bit key down to 64-bit security, roughly a des equivalent. this is one of the reasons why aes supports a 256-bit key length. see the discussion on the relationship between key lengths and quantum computing attacks at the bottom of this page for more information.
us government export policy has long restricted the 'strength' of cryptography that can be sent out of the country. for many years the limit was 40 bits. today, a key length of 40 bits offers little protection against even a casual attacker with a single pc, a predictable and inevitable consequence of governmental restrictions limiting key length. in response, by the year 2000, most of the major us restrictions on the use of strong encryption were relaxed. however, not all regulations have been removed, and encryption registration with the u.s. bureau of industry and security is still required to export "mass market encryption commodities, software and components with encryption exceeding 64 bits" ().
ibm's lucifer cipher was selected in 1974 as the base for what would become the data encryption standard. lucifer's key length was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits, which the nsa and nist argued was sufficient. the nsa has major computing resources and a large budget; some cryptographers including whitfield diffie and martin hellman complained that this made the cipher so weak that nsa computers would be able to break a des key in a day through brute force parallel computing. the nsa disputed this, claiming brute forcing des would take them something like 91 years. however, by the late 90s, it became clear that des could be cracked in a few days' time-frame with custom-built hardware such as could be purchased by a large corporation or government. the book "cracking des" (o'reilly and associates) tells of the successful attempt in 1998 to break 56-bit des by a brute-force attack mounted by a cyber civil rights group with limited resources; see eff des cracker. even before that demonstration, 56 bits was considered insufficient length for symmetric algorithm keys; des has been replaced in many applications by triple des, which has 112 bits of security when used 168-bit keys (triple key). in 2002, distributed.net and its volunteers broke a 64-bit rc5 key after several years effort, using about seventy thousand (mostly home) computers.
the advanced encryption standard published in 2001 uses key sizes of 128 bits, 192 or 256 bits. many observers consider 128 bits sufficient for the foreseeable future for symmetric algorithms of aes's quality until quantum computers become available. however, as of 2015, the u.s. national security agency has issued guidance that it plans to switch to quantum computing resistant algorithms and now requires 256-bit aes keys for data classified up to top secret.
in 2003, the u.s. national institute for standards and technology, nist proposed phasing out 80-bit keys by 2015. at 2005, 80-bit keys were allowed only until 2010.
since 2015, nist guidance says that "the use of keys that provide less than 112 bits of security strength for key agreement is now disallowed." nist approved symmetric encryption algorithms include three-key triple des, and aes. approvals for two-key triple des and skipjack were withdrawn in 2015; the nsa's skipjack algorithm used in its fortezza program employs 80-bit keys.
the effectiveness of public key cryptosystems depends on the intractability (computational and theoretical) of certain mathematical problems such as integer factorization. these problems are time consuming to solve, but usually faster than trying all possible keys by brute force. thus, asymmetric algorithm keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys. as of 2002, an asymmetric key length of 1024 bits was generally considered by cryptology experts to be the minimum necessary for the rsa encryption algorithm.
the finite field diffie-hellman algorithm has roughly the same key strength as rsa for the same key sizes. the work factor for breaking diffie-hellman is based on the discrete logarithm problem, which is related to the integer factorization problem on which rsa's strength is based. thus, a 3072-bit diffie-hellman key has about the same strength as a 3072-bit rsa key.
one of the asymmetric algorithm types, elliptic curve cryptography, or ecc, appears to be secure with shorter keys than other asymmetric key algorithms require. nist guidelines state that ecc keys should be twice the length of equivalent strength symmetric key algorithms. so, for example, a 224-bit ecc key would have roughly the same strength as a 112-bit symmetric key. these estimates assume no major breakthroughs in solving the underlying mathematical problems that ecc is based on. a message encrypted with an elliptic key algorithm using a 109-bit long key has been broken by brute force.
the nsa previously specified that "elliptic curve public key cryptography using the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve as specified in fips-186-2 and sha-256 are appropriate for protecting classified information up to the secret level. use of the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve and sha-384 are necessary for the protection of top secret information." in 2015 the nsa announced that it plans to transition from elliptic curve cryptography to new algorithms that are resistant to attack by future quantum computers. in the interim it recommends the larger 384-bit curve for all classified information.
the two best known quantum computing attacks are based on shor's algorithm and grover's algorithm. of the two, shor's offers the greater risk to current security systems.
derivatives of shor's algorithm are widely conjectured to be effective against all mainstream public-key algorithms including rsa, diffie-hellman and elliptic curve cryptography. according to professor gilles brassard, an expert in quantum computing: "the time needed to factor an rsa integer is the same order as the time needed to use that same integer as modulus for a single rsa encryption. in other words, it takes no more time to break rsa on a quantum computer (up to a multiplicative constant) than to use it legitimately on a classical computer." the general consensus is that these public key algorithms are insecure at any key size if sufficiently large quantum computers capable of running shor's algorithm become available. the implication of this attack is that all data encrypted using current standards based security systems such as the ubiquitous ssl used to protect e-commerce and internet banking and ssh used to protect access to sensitive computing systems is at risk. encrypted data protected using public-key algorithms can be archived and may be broken at a later time.
mainstream symmetric ciphers (such as aes or twofish) and collision resistant hash functions (such as sha) are widely conjectured to offer greater security against known quantum computing attacks. they are widely thought most vulnerable to grover's algorithm. bennett, bernstein, brassard, and vazirani proved in 1996 that a brute-force key search on a quantum computer cannot be faster than roughly 2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2 in the classical case. thus in the presence of large quantum computers an "n"-bit key can provide at least "n"/2 bits of security. quantum brute force is easily defeated by doubling the key length, which has little extra computational cost in ordinary use. this implies that at least a 256-bit symmetric key is required to achieve 128-bit security rating against a quantum computer. as mentioned above, the nsa announced in 2015 that it plans to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms.
according to nsa "a sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely-deployed public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures. ... it is generally accepted that quantum computing techniques are much less effective against symmetric algorithms than against current widely used public key algorithms. while public key cryptography requires changes in the fundamental design to protect against a potential future quantum computer, symmetric key algorithms are believed to be secure provided a sufficiently large key size is used. ... in the longer term, nsa looks to nist to identify a broadly accepted, standardized suite of commercial public key algorithms that are not vulnerable to quantum attacks.
, the nsa's commercial national security algorithm suite includes:

cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) is a psycho-social intervention that aims to improve mental health. cbt focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.
the cbt model is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology. it is different from historical approaches to psychotherapy, such as the psychoanalytic approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. instead, cbt is a "problem-focused" and "action-oriented" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. the therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder. cbt is based on the belief that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of psychological disorders, and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms.
when compared to psychoactive medications, review studies have found cbt alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression and anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), tics, substance abuse, eating disorders and borderline personality disorder. it is often recommended in combination with medications for treating other conditions, such as severe obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) and major depressive disorder, opioid use disorder, bipolar disorder and psychotic disorders. in addition, cbt is recommended as the first line of treatment for majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and conduct disorder. researchers have found that other "bona fide" therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults. along with interpersonal psychotherapy (ipt), cbt is recommended in treatment guidelines as a psychosocial treatment of choice, and cbt and ipt are the only psychosocial interventions that psychiatry residents are mandated to be trained in.
mainstream cognitive behavioral therapy assumes that changing maladaptive thinking leads to change in behavior and affect, but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself. the goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is not to diagnose a person with a particular disease, but to look at the person as a whole and decide what can be altered.
therapists or computer-based programs use cbt techniques to help people challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace errors in thinking, known as cognitive distortions, such as "overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing"" with ""more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior". cognitive distortions can be either a pseudo-discrimination belief or an over-generalization of something. cbt techniques may also be used to help individuals take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward cognitive distortions so as to diminish their impact.
mainstream cbt helps individuals replace "maladaptive... coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones", by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that they react to certain habits or behaviors, but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with cbt over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training.
cbt can be seen as having six phases:
these steps are based on a system created by kanfer and saslow. after identifying the behaviors that need changing, whether they be in excess or deficit, and treatment has occurred, the psychologist must identify whether or not the intervention succeeded. for example, "if the goal was to decrease the behavior, then there should be a decrease relative to the baseline. if the critical behavior remains at or above the baseline, then the intervention has failed."
the steps in the assessment phase include:
the re-conceptualization phase makes up much of the "cognitive" portion of cbt. a summary of modern cbt approaches is given by hofmann.
there are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them. use of the term "cbt" may refer to different interventions, including "self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or biofeedback, development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and goal setting". treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. cbt is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for self-help applications. some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. cognitive restructuring), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. "in vivo" exposure therapy). interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.
cbt may be delivered in conjunction with a variety of diverse but related techniques such as exposure therapy, stress inoculation, cognitive processing therapy, cognitive therapy, relaxation training, dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. some practitioners promote a form of mindful cognitive therapy which includes a greater emphasis on self-awareness as part of the therapeutic process.
in adults, cbt has been shown to have effectiveness and a role in the treatment plans for anxiety disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression, eating disorders, chronic low back pain, personality disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, in the adjustment, depression, and anxiety associated with fibromyalgia, and with post-spinal cord injuries.
in children or adolescents, cbt is an effective part of treatment plans for anxiety disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression and suicidality, eating disorders and obesity, obsessive–compulsive disorder (ocd), and posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as tic disorders, trichotillomania, and other repetitive behavior disorders. cbt-sp, an adaptation of cbt for suicide prevention (sp), was specifically designed for treating youths who are severely depressed and who have recently attempted suicide within the past 90 days, and was found to be effective, feasible, and acceptable. cbt has also been shown to be effective for posttraumatic stress disorder in very young children (3 to 6 years of age). cbt has also been applied to a variety of childhood disorders, including depressive disorders and various anxiety disorders.
cbt combined with hypnosis and distraction reduces self-reported pain in children.
cochrane reviews have found no evidence that cbt is effective for tinnitus, although there appears to be an effect on management of associated depression and quality of life in this condition. other recent cochrane reviews found no convincing evidence that cbt training helps foster care providers manage difficult behaviors in the youths under their care, nor was it helpful in treating people who abuse their intimate partners.
according to a 2004 review by inserm of three methods, cognitive behavioral therapy was either "proven" or "presumed" to be an effective therapy on several specific mental disorders. according to the study, cbt was effective at treating schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, bulimia, anorexia, personality disorders and alcohol dependency.
some meta-analyses find cbt more effective than psychodynamic therapy and equal to other therapies in treating anxiety and depression.
computerized cbt (ccbt) has been proven to be effective by randomized controlled and other trials in treating depression and anxiety disorders, including children, as well as insomnia. some research has found similar effectiveness to an intervention of informational websites and weekly telephone calls. ccbt was found to be equally effective as face-to-face cbt in adolescent anxiety and insomnia. "sparx" is a video game to help young persons, using the cbt method to teach them how to resolve their own issues.
criticism of cbt sometimes focuses on implementations (such as the uk iapt) which may result initially in low quality therapy being offered by poorly trained practitioners. however, evidence supports the effectiveness of cbt for anxiety and depression. acceptance and commitment therapy (act) is a specialist branch of cbt (sometimes referred to as contextual cbt). act uses mindfulness and acceptance interventions and has been found to have a greater longevity in therapeutic outcomes. in a study with anxiety, cbt and act improved similarly across all outcomes from pre-to post-treatment. however, during a 12-month follow-up, act proved to be more effective, showing that it is a highly viable lasting treatment model for anxiety disorders.
evidence suggests that the addition of hypnotherapy as an adjunct to cbt improves treatment efficacy for a variety of clinical issues.
cbt has been applied in both clinical and non-clinical environments to treat disorders such as personality conditions and behavioral problems. a systematic review of cbt in depression and anxiety disorders concluded that "cbt delivered in primary care, especially including computer- or internet-based self-help programs, is potentially more effective than usual care and could be delivered effectively by primary care therapists."
emerging evidence suggests a possible role for cbt in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd); hypochondriasis; coping with the impact of multiple sclerosis; sleep disturbances related to aging; dysmenorrhea; and bipolar disorder, but more study is needed and results should be interpreted with caution. cbt can have a therapeutic effects on easing symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with alzheimer's disease. cbt has been studied as an aid in the treatment of anxiety associated with stuttering. initial studies have shown cbt to be effective in reducing social anxiety in adults who stutter, but not in reducing stuttering frequency.
in the case of people with metastatic breast cancer, data is limited but cbt and other psychosocial interventions might help with psychological outcomes and pain management.
there is some evidence that cbt is superior in the long-term to benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines in the treatment and management of insomnia. cbt has been shown to be moderately effective for treating chronic fatigue syndrome.
in the united kingdom, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends cbt in the treatment plans for a number of mental health difficulties, including posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (ocd), bulimia nervosa, and clinical depression.
cbt has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults with anxiety disorders.
a basic concept in some cbt treatments used in anxiety disorders is "in vivo" exposure. the term refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. for example, a woman with ptsd who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears. likewise, a person with social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech. this "two-factor" model is often credited to o. hobart mowrer. through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be "unlearned" (referred to as extinction and habituation). studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that glucocorticoids may possibly lead to a more successful extinction learning during exposure therapy. for instance, glucocorticoids can prevent aversive learning episodes from being retrieved and heighten reinforcement of memory traces creating a non-fearful reaction in feared situations. a combination of glucocorticoids and exposure therapy may be a better improved treatment for treating patients with anxiety disorders.
a 2015 cochrane review also found that cbt might be helpful for patients with non-cardiac chest pain, and may reduce frequency of chest pain episodes.
cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. the american psychiatric association practice guidelines (april 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. one etiological theory of depression is aaron t. beck's cognitive theory of depression. his theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. according to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.
beck also described a negative cognitive triad. the cognitive triad is made up of the depressed individual's negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. beck suggested that these negative evaluations derive from the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person. according to this theory, depressed people have views such as "i never do a good job", "it is impossible to have a good day", and "things will never get better". a negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over-generalization, magnification, and minimization. these cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.
in long-term psychoses, cbt is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses. several meta-analyses suggested that cbt is effective in schizophrenia, and the american psychiatric association includes cbt in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment. there is also limited evidence of effectiveness for cbt in bipolar disorder and severe depression.
a 2010 meta-analysis found that no trial employing both blinding and psychological placebos has shown cbt to be effective in either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and that the effect size of cbt was small in major depressive disorder. they also found a lack of evidence to conclude that cbt was effective in preventing relapses in bipolar disorder. evidence that severe depression is mitigated by cbt is also lacking, with anti-depressant medications still viewed as significantly more effective than cbt, although success with cbt for depression was observed beginning in the 1990s.
according to cox, lyn yvonne abramson, patricia devine, and hollon (2012), cognitive behavioral therapy can also be used to reduce prejudice towards others. this other-directed prejudice can cause depression in the "others", or in the self when a person becomes part of a group he or she previously had prejudice towards (i.e. deprejudice). "devine and colleagues (2012) developed a successful prejudice perpetrator intervention with many conceptual parallels to cbt. like cbt, their intervention taught sources to be aware of their automative thoughts and to intentionally deploy a variety of cognitive techniques against automatic stereotyping." a 2012 systematic review investigated the effects of cbt compared with other psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia:
cbt is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing. older individuals in particular have certain characteristics that need to be acknowledged and the therapy altered to account for these differences thanks to age.
for anxiety disorders, use of cbt with people at risk has significantly reduced the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety symptoms, and also given significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes. in another study, 3% of the group receiving the cbt intervention developed generalized anxiety disorder by 12 months postintervention compared with 14% in the control group. subthreshold panic disorder sufferers were found to significantly benefit from use of cbt. use of cbt was found to significantly reduce social anxiety prevalence.
for depressive disorders, a stepped-care intervention (watchful waiting, cbt and medication if appropriate) achieved a 50% lower incidence rate in a patient group aged 75 or older. another depression study found a neutral effect compared to personal, social, and health education, and usual school provision, and included a comment on potential for increased depression scores from people who have received cbt due to greater self recognition and acknowledgement of existing symptoms of depression and negative thinking styles. a further study also saw a neutral result. a meta-study of the coping with depression course, a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by a psychoeducational method, saw a 38% reduction in risk of major depression.
for people at risk of psychosis, in 2014 the uk national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommended preventive cbt.
cbt is also used for gambling addiction. the percentage of people who problem gamble is 1–3% around the world. cognitive behavioral therapy develops skills for relapse prevention and someone can learn to control their mind and manage high-risk cases.
cbt looks at the habit of smoking cigarettes as a learned behavior, which later evolves into a coping strategy to handle daily stressors. because smoking is often easily accessible, and quickly allows the user to feel good, it can take precedence over other coping strategies, and eventually work its way into everyday life during non-stressful events as well. cbt aims to target the function of the behavior, as it can vary between individuals, and works to inject other coping mechanisms in place of smoking. cbt also aims to support individuals suffering from strong cravings, which are a major reported reason for relapse during treatment.
in a 2008 controlled study out of stanford university school of medicine, cbt was proven as an effective tool for most participants. the results of 304 random adult participants were tracked over the course of one year. during this program, some participants were provided medication, cbt, 24 hour phone support, or some combination of the three methods. at 20 weeks, the participants who received cbt had a 45% abstinence rate, versus non-cbt participants, who had a 29% abstinence rate. overall, the study concluded that emphasizing cognitive and behavioral strategies to support smoking cessation can help individuals build tools for long term smoking abstinence.
mental health history can affect the outcomes of treatment. individuals with a history of depressive disorders had a lower rate of success when using cbt alone to combat smoking addiction.
though many forms of treatment can support individuals with eating disorders, cbt is proven to be a more effective treatment than medications and interpersonal psychotherapy alone. cbt aims to combat major causes of distress such as negative cognitions surrounding body weight, shape and size. cbt therapists also work with individuals to regulate strong emotions and thoughts that lead to dangerous compensatory behaviors. cbt is the first line of treatment for bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder non-specific.
research has identified internet addiction as a new clinical disorder that causes relational, occupational, and social problems. cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) has been suggested as the treatment of choice for internet addiction, and addiction recovery in general has used cbt as part of treatment planning.
precursors of certain fundamental aspects of cbt have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly stoicism. stoic philosophers, particularly epictetus, believed logic could be used to identify and discard false beliefs that lead to destructive emotions, which has influenced the way modern cognitive-behavioral therapists identify cognitive distortions that contribute to depression and anxiety. for example, aaron t. beck's original treatment manual for depression states, "the philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the stoic philosophers". another example of stoic influence on cognitive theorists is epictetus on albert ellis. a key philosophical figure who also influenced the development of cbt was john stuart mill.
the modern roots of cbt can be traced to the development of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with john b. watson and rosalie rayner's studies of conditioning in 1920. behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924 with mary cover jones' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children. these were the antecedents of the development of joseph wolpe's behavioral therapy in the 1950s. it was the work of wolpe and watson, which was based on ivan pavlov's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced hans eysenck and arnold lazarus to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on classical conditioning.
during the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the united states, the united kingdom, and south africa, who were inspired by the behaviorist learning theory of ivan pavlov, john b. watson, and clark l. hull. in britain, joseph wolpe, who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of systematic desensitization, applied behavioral research to the treatment of neurotic disorders. wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. british psychologist hans eysenck presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.
at the same time of eysenck's work, b. f. skinner and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on operant conditioning. skinner's work was referred to as radical behaviorism and avoided anything related to cognition. however, julian rotter, in 1954, and albert bandura, in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on social learning theory, by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification.
the emphasis on behavioral factors constituted the "first wave" of cbt.
one of the first therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy was alfred adler with his notion of basic mistakes and how they contributed to creation of unhealthy or useless behavioral and life goals. adler's work influenced the work of albert ellis, who developed the earliest cognitive-based psychotherapy, known today as rational emotive behavior therapy, or rebt.
around the same time that rational emotive therapy, as it was known then, was being developed, aaron t. beck was conducting free association sessions in his psychoanalytic practice. during these sessions, beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as freud had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking may be the culprits of emotional distress. it was from this hypothesis that beck developed cognitive therapy, and called these thoughts "automatic thoughts".
it was these two therapies, rational emotive therapy and cognitive therapy, that started the "second wave" of cbt, which was the emphasis on cognitive factors.
although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating depression. behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called "cognitive revolution". the therapeutic approaches of albert ellis and aaron t. beck gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of "mentalistic" concepts like thoughts and cognitions. both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present.
in initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. during the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for panic disorder by david m. clark in the uk and david h. barlow in the us.
over time, cognitive behavior therapy became to be known not only as a therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies. these therapies include, but are not limited to, rational emotive therapy (rebt), cognitive therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, reality therapy/choice theory, cognitive processing therapy, emdr, and multimodal therapy. all of these therapies are a blending of cognitive- and behavior-based elements.
this blending of theoretical and technical foundations from both behavior and cognitive therapies constituted the "third wave" of cbt. the most prominent therapies of this third wave are dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.
a typical cbt programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6-18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of a 1–3 weeks between sessions. this initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months. cbt has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links.
cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the scientist–practitioner model in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear operationalization of the problem, and an emphasis on measurement, including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. these are often met through "homework" assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. the completion of these assignments – which can be as simple as a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event – indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. the therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance. unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in cbt. for example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first. the therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.
computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (ccbt) has been described by nice as a ""generic term for delivering cbt via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system"", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. it is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or icbt. ccbt has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. in this context, it is important not to confuse cbt with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-learning.
ccbt has been found in meta-studies to be cost-effective and often cheaper than usual care, including for anxiety. studies have shown that individuals with social anxiety and depression experienced improvement with online cbt-based methods. a review of current ccbt research in the treatment of ocd in children found this interface to hold great potential for future treatment of ocd in youths and adolescent populations. additionally, most internet interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder use ccbt. ccbt is also predisposed to treating mood disorders amongst non-heterosexual populations, who may avoid face-to-face therapy from fear of stigma. however presently ccbt programs seldom cater to these populations.
a key issue in ccbt use is low uptake and completion rates, even when it has been clearly made available and explained. ccbt completion rates and treatment efficacy have been found in some studies to be higher when use of ccbt is supported personally, with supporters not limited only to therapists, than when use is in a self-help form alone. another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as treatment outcome, is to design software that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology.
in february 2006 nice recommended that ccbt be made available for use within the nhs across england and wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication, and ccbt is made available by some health systems. the 2009 nice guideline recognized that there are likely to be a number of computerized cbt products that are useful to patients, but removed endorsement of any specific product.
a relatively new avenue of research is the combination of artificial intelligence and ccbt. it has been proposed to use modern technology to create ccbt that simulates face-to-face therapy. this might be achieved in cognitive behavior therapy for a specific disorder using the comprehensive domain knowledge of cbt. one area where this has been attempted is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.
another new method of access is the use of mobile app or smartphone applications to deliver self-help or guided cbt. technology companies are developing mobile-based artificial intelligence chatbot applications in delivering cbt as an early intervention to support mental health, to build psychological resilience and to promote emotional well-being. artificial intelligence (ai) text-based conversational application delivered securely and privately over smartphone devices have the ability to scale globally and offer contextual and always-available support. active research is underway including real world data studies that measure effectiveness and engagement of text-based smartphone chatbot apps for delivery of cbt using a text-based conversational interface.
enabling patients to read self-help cbt guides has been shown to be effective by some studies. however one study found a negative effect in patients who tended to ruminate, and another meta-analysis found that the benefit was only significant when the self-help was guided (e.g. by a medical professional).
patient participation in group courses has been shown to be effective. in a meta-analysis reviewing evidence-based treatment of ocd in children, individual cbt was found to be more efficacious than group cbt.
brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bcbt) is a form of cbt which has been developed for situations in which there are time constraints on the therapy sessions. bcbt takes place over a couple of sessions that can last up to 12 accumulated hours by design. this technique was first implemented and developed on soldiers overseas in active duty by david m. rudd to prevent suicide.
breakdown of treatment
cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (cebt) is a form of cbt developed initially for individuals with eating disorders but now used with a range of problems including anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd), post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and anger problems. it combines aspects of cbt and dialectical behavioral therapy and aims to improve understanding and tolerance of emotions in order to facilitate the therapeutic process. it is frequently used as a "pretreatment" to prepare and better equip individuals for longer-term therapy.
structured cognitive behavioral training (scbt) is a cognitive-based process with core philosophies that draw heavily from cbt. like cbt, scbt asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. scbt also builds on core cbt philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, albert ellis's rational emotive behavior therapy. scbt differs from cbt in two distinct ways. first, scbt is delivered in a highly regimented format. second, scbt is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. scbt is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. scbt has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. scbt has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.
moral reconation therapy, a type of cbt used to help felons overcome antisocial personality disorder (aspd), slightly decreases the risk of further offending. it is generally implemented in a group format because of the risk of offenders with aspd being given one-on-one therapy reinforces narcissistic behavioral characteristics, and can be used in correctional or outpatient settings. groups usually meet weekly for two to six months.
this type of therapy uses a blend of cognitive, behavioral and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. this usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. this is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. the first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, and a variety of reading materials. this allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. this phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. the focus is conceptualization.
the second phase emphasizes the aspect of skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. the client is taught skills that help them cope with their stressors. these skills are then practised in the space of therapy. these skills involve self-regulation, problem-solving, interpersonal communication skills, etc.
the third and final phase is the application and following through of the skills learned in the training process. this gives the client opportunities to apply their learned skills to a wide range of stressors. activities include role-playing, imagery, modeling, etc. in the end, the client will have been trained on a preventative basis to inoculate personal, chronic, and future stressors by breaking down their stressors into problems they will address in long-term, short-term, and intermediate coping goals.
mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy (mcbh) is a form of cbt focusing on awareness in reflective approach with addressing of subconscious tendencies. it is more the process that contains basically three phases that are used for achieving wanted goals.
the unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders (up) is a form of cbt, developed by david h. barlow and researchers at boston university, that can be applied to a range of depression and anxiety disorders. the rationale is that anxiety and depression disorders often occur together due to common underlying causes and can efficiently be treated together.
the up includes a common set of components:
the up has been shown to produce equivalent results to single-diagnosis protocols for specific disorders, such as ocd and social anxiety disorder.
the up is disseminated by the unified protocol institute.
the research conducted for cbt has been a topic of sustained controversy. while some researchers write that cbt is more effective than other treatments, many other researchers and practitioners have questioned the validity of such claims. for example, one study determined cbt to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. however, researchers responding directly to that study conducted a re-analysis and found no evidence of cbt being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other cbt clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of cbt superiority.
a major criticism has been that clinical studies of cbt efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind to the type of treatment). they may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). the patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.
the importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of cbt when placebo control and blindedness were factored in. pooled data from published trials of cbt in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (mdd), and bipolar disorder that used controls for non-specific effects of intervention were analyzed. this study concluded that cbt is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates; treatment effects are small in treatment studies of mdd, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. for mdd, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.
additionally, a 2015 meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects of cbt on depression have been declining since 1977. the overall results showed two different declines in effect sizes: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. additional sub-analysis revealed that cbt studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the beck cbt manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use cbt without a manual. the authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. the authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.
furthermore, other researchers write that cbt studies have high drop-out rates compared to other treatments. at times, the cbt drop-out rates can be more than five times higher than other treatments groups. for example, the researchers provided statistics of 28 participants in a group receiving cbt therapy dropping out, compared to 5 participants in a group receiving problem-solving therapy dropping out, or 11 participants in a group receiving psychodynamic therapy dropping out. this high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, which is commonly treated with cbt. those treated with cbt have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors.
other researchers conducting an analysis of treatments for youths who self-injure found similar drop-out rates in cbt and dbt groups. in this study, the researchers analyzed several clinical trials that measured the efficacy of cbt administered to youths who self-injure. the researchers concluded that none of them were found to be efficacious. these conclusions were made using the apa division 12 task force on the promotion and dissemination of psychological procedures to determine intervention potency.
the methods employed in cbt research have not been the only criticisms; some individuals have called its theory and therapy into question. for example, fancher argues that cbt has failed to provide a framework for clear and correct thinking. he states that it is strange for cbt theorists to develop a framework for determining distorted thinking without ever developing a framework for "cognitive clarity" or what would count as "healthy, normal thinking". additionally, he writes that irrational thinking cannot be a source of mental and emotional distress when there is no evidence of rational thinking causing psychological well-being. or, that social psychology has proven the normal cognitive processes of the average person to be irrational, even those who are psychologically well. fancher also says that the theory of cbt is inconsistent with basic principles and research of rationality, and even ignores many rules of logic. he argues that cbt makes something of thinking that is far less exciting and true than thinking probably is. among his other arguments are the maintaining of the status quo promoted in cbt, the self-deception encouraged within clients and patients engaged in cbt, how poorly the research is conducted, and some of its basic tenets and norms: "the basic norm of cognitive therapy is this: except for how the patient thinks, everything is ok".
meanwhile, slife and williams write that one of the hidden assumptions in cbt is that of determinism, or the absence of free will. they argue that cbt invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. they state that cbt holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states: nowhere in cbt theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. according to slife and williams, at its most basic foundational assumptions, cbt holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.
another criticism of cbt theory, especially as applied to major depressive disorder (mdd), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes.
cbt is generally seen as having very low if any side effects. calls have been made for more appraisal of cbt side effects.
the uk's national health service announced in 2008 that more therapists would be trained to provide cbt at government expense as part of an initiative called improving access to psychological therapies (iapt). the nice said that cbt would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where cbt had failed. therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding cbt receives. psychotherapist and professor andrew samuels stated that this constitutes "a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money ... everyone has been seduced by cbt's apparent cheapness." the uk council for psychotherapy issued a press release in 2012 saying that the iapt's policies were undermining traditional psychotherapy and criticized proposals that would limit some approved therapies to cbt, claiming that they restricted patients to "a watered down version of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), often delivered by very lightly trained staff".
the nice also recommends offering cbt to people suffering from schizophrenia, as well as those at risk of suffering from a psychotic episode.

chinese (; or especially though not exclusively for written chinese: ) is a group of related, but in many cases not mutually intelligible, language varieties, forming the sinitic branch of the sino-tibetan language family. chinese is spoken by the ethnic chinese majority and many minority ethnic groups in china. about 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of chinese as their first language.
the varieties of chinese are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a language family. the internal diversity of chinese has been likened to that of the romance languages, but may be even more varied. there are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken by far is mandarin (about 960 million, e.g. southwestern mandarin), followed by wu (80 million, e.g. shanghainese), min (70 million, e.g. southern min), yue (60 million, e.g. cantonese), etc. most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, and even dialect groups within min chinese may not be mutually intelligible. some, however, like xiang and certain southwest mandarin dialects, may share common terms and a certain degree of intelligibility. all varieties of chinese are tonal and analytic.
standard chinese "(pǔtōnghuà/guóyǔ/huáyǔ)" is a standardized form of spoken chinese based on the beijing dialect of mandarin. it is the official language of china and taiwan, as well as one of the four official languages of singapore. it is one of the six official languages of the united nations. the written form of the standard language (; "zhōngwén"), based on the logograms known as chinese characters (/; "hànzì"), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.
the earliest chinese written records are shang dynasty-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 bce. the phonetic categories of archaic chinese can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. during the northern and southern dynasties period, middle chinese went through several sound changes and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. "qieyun", a rime dictionary, recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. the royal courts of the ming and early qing dynasties operated using a koiné language (guanhua) based on nanjing dialect of lower yangtze mandarin. standard chinese was adopted in the 1930s, and is now the official language of both the people's republic of china and the republic of china on taiwan.
most linguists classify all varieties of chinese as part of the sino-tibetan language family, together with burmese, tibetan and many other languages spoken in the himalayas and the southeast asian massif. although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of sino-tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as indo-european or austroasiatic. difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact. in addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, and are often also sensitive border zones. without a secure reconstruction of proto-sino-tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear. a top-level branching into chinese and tibeto-burman languages is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.
the first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the shang dynasty. as the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible. in reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.modern standard chinese has 22 consonants, but more than 30 consonants used more than 1,000 years ago can be said to be the ancestors of modern standard chinese.
the earliest examples of chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 bce in the late shang dynasty. old chinese was the language of the western zhou period (1046–771 bce), recorded in inscriptions on bronze artifacts, the "classic of poetry" and portions of the "book of documents" and "i ching". scholars have attempted to reconstruct the phonology of old chinese by comparing later varieties of chinese with the rhyming practice of the "classic of poetry" and the phonetic elements found in the majority of chinese characters. although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that old chinese differs from middle chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids. most recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into tone distinctions in middle chinese. several derivational affixes have also been identified, but the language lacks inflection, and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and grammatical particles.
middle chinese was the language used during northern and southern dynasties and the sui, tang, and song dynasties (6th through 10th centuries ce). it can be divided into an early period, reflected by the "qieyun" rime book (601 ce), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by rhyme tables such as the "yunjing" constructed by ancient chinese philologists as a guide to the "qieyun" system. these works define phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent. linguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern varieties of chinese, borrowed chinese words in japanese, vietnamese, and korean, and transcription evidence. the resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect. most linguists now believe it represents a diasystem encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.
the relationship between spoken and written chinese is rather complex. its spoken varieties have evolved at different rates, while written chinese itself has changed much less. classical chinese literature began in the spring and autumn period.
after the fall of the northern song dynasty, and during the reign of the jin (jurchen) and yuan (mongol) dynasties in northern china, a common speech (now called old mandarin) developed based on the dialects of the north china plain around the capital.
the "zhongyuan yinyun" (1324) was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new "sanqu" verse form in this language.
together with the slightly later "menggu ziyun", this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern mandarin dialects.
up to the early 20th century, most of the people in china spoke only their local variety.
as a practical measure, officials of the ming and qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on mandarin varieties, known as "guānhuà" (/, literally "language of officials").
for most of this period, this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect.
by the middle of the 19th century, the beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.
in the 1930s a standard national language "guóyǔ" (/ "national language") was adopted.
after much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the national language unification commission finally settled on the beijing dialect in 1932. the people's republic founded in 1949 retained this standard, calling it "pǔtōnghuà" (/ "common speech"). the national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both mainland china and taiwan. in hong kong and macau, because of their colonial and linguistic history, the language used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local cantonese, although the standard language has become very influential and is being taught in schools.
the chinese language has spread to neighbouring countries through a variety of means. northern vietnam was incorporated into the han empire in 111 bce, marking the beginning of a period of chinese control that ran almost continuously for a millennium. the four commanderies were established in northern korea in the first century bce, but disintegrated in the following centuries. chinese buddhism spread over east asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries ce, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in literary chinese. later korea, japan, and vietnam developed strong central governments modeled on chinese institutions, with literary chinese as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in korea and (to a lesser extent) japan, and the early 20th century in vietnam. scholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using literary chinese.
although they used chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called sino-xenic pronunciations. chinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the korean, japanese and vietnamese languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies. this massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of moraic structure in japanese and the disruption of vowel harmony in korean.
borrowed chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of latin and ancient greek roots in european languages. many new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name western concepts and artifacts. these coinages, written in shared chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. they have even been accepted into chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form. often different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries. the proportion of vocabulary of chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language. for example, in japan, sino-japanese words account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.
vietnam, korea, and japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on chinese characters, but later replaced with the "hangul" alphabet for korean and supplemented with "kana" syllabaries for japanese, while vietnamese continued to be written with the complex "chữ nôm" script. however, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century. today japanese is written with a composite script using both chinese characters ("kanji") and kana. korean is written exclusively with hangul in north korea, and supplementary chinese characters ("hanja") are increasingly rarely used in south korea. vietnamese is written with a latin-based alphabet.
examples of loan words in english include "tea", from hokkien (min nan) (), "dim sum", from cantonese "dim sam" and "kumquat", from cantonese "gamgwat" ().
jerry norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of chinese. these varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely. generally, mountainous south china exhibits more linguistic diversity than the north china plain. in parts of south china, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. for instance, wuzhou is about upstream from guangzhou, but the yue variety spoken there is more like that of guangzhou than is that of taishan, southwest of guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers. in parts of fujian the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.
until the late 20th century, chinese emigrants to southeast asia and north america came from southeast coastal areas, where min, hakka, and yue dialects are spoken.
the vast majority of chinese immigrants to north america spoke the taishan dialect, from a small coastal area southwest of guangzhou.
local varieties of chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of middle chinese voiced initials:
the classification of li rong, which is used in the "language atlas of china" (1987), distinguishes three further groups:
some varieties remain unclassified, including danzhou dialect (spoken in danzhou, on hainan island), waxianghua (spoken in western hunan) and shaozhou tuhua (spoken in northern guangdong).
standard chinese, often called mandarin, is the official standard language of china and taiwan, and one of the four official languages of singapore (where it is called "huáyŭ" or simply chinese). standard chinese is based on the beijing dialect, the dialect of mandarin as spoken in beijing. the governments of both china and taiwan intend for speakers of all chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.
in mainland china and taiwan, diglossia has been a common feature. for example, in addition to standard chinese, a resident of shanghai might speak shanghainese; and, if he or she grew up elsewhere, then he or she is also likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area. a native of guangzhou may speak both cantonese and standard chinese. in addition to mandarin, most taiwanese also speak minnan, hakka, or an austronesian language. a taiwanese may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from mandarin and other taiwanese languages, and this mixture is considered normal in daily or informal speech.
the official chinese designation for the major branches of chinese is "fāngyán" (, literally "regional speech"), whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called "dìdiǎn fāngyán" (/ "local speech"). conventional english-language usage in chinese linguistics is to use "dialect" for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) and "dialect group" for a regional grouping such as mandarin or wu. because varieties from different groups are not mutually intelligible, some scholars prefer to describe wu and others as separate languages. jerry norman called this practice misleading, pointing out that wu, which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion, and that the same is true for each of the other groups.
mutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language, although others do not regard it as decisive, particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with chinese. as explains, linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. prestige variety, such as standard mandarin), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity. john defrancis argues that it is inappropriate to refer to mandarin, wu and so on as "dialects" because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. on the other hand, he also objects to considering them as separate languages, as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive "religious, economic, political, and other differences" between speakers that exist, for example, between french catholics and english protestants in canada, but not between speakers of cantonese and mandarin in china, owing to china's near-uninterrupted history of centralized government.
because of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed: iso 639-3 follows "ethnologue" in assigning individual language codes to the 13 main subdivisions, while chinese as a whole is classified as a 'macrolanguage'. other options include "vernacular", "lect" "regionalect", "topolect", and "variety".
most chinese people consider the spoken varieties as one single language because speakers share a common culture and history, as well as a shared national identity and a common written form. to chinese nationalists, the idea of chinese as a language family may suggest that the chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than it actually is and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative. additionally, some of whose supporters promote the local taiwanese hokkien variety.
the phonological structure of each syllable consists of a nucleus that has a vowel (which can be a monophthong, diphthong, or even a triphthong in certain varieties), preceded by an onset (a single consonant, or consonant+glide; zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a coda consonant; a syllable also carries a tone. there are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. an example of this is in cantonese, where the nasal sonorant consonants and can stand alone as their own syllable.
in mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final glide is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals , , , the retroflex approximant , and voiceless stops , , , or . some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as standard chinese, are limited to only , and .
the number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from middle chinese. the mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. the total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as english.
all varieties of spoken chinese use tones to distinguish words. a few dialects of north china may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south china have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. one exception from this is shanghainese which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned pitch accent system much like modern japanese.
a very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in chinese is the application of the four tones of standard chinese (along with the neutral tone) to the syllable "ma". the tones are exemplified by the following five chinese words:
standard cantonese, in contrast, has six tones in open syllables and three tones in syllables ending with stops:
chinese is often described as a "monosyllabic" language. however, this is only partially correct. it is largely accurate when describing classical chinese and middle chinese; in classical chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. in the modern varieties, it is usually the case that a morpheme (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; in contrast, english has plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as "seven", "elephant", "para-" and "-able".
some of the conservative southern varieties of modern chinese have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary. in modern mandarin, however, most nouns, adjectives and verbs are largely disyllabic. a significant cause of this is phonological attrition. sound change over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. in modern mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in vietnamese (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in english.
this phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of homophones. as an example, the small langenscheidt pocket chinese dictionary lists six words that are commonly pronounced as "shí" (tone 2): "ten"; / "real, actual"; / "know (a person), recognize"; "stone"; / "time"; "food, eat". these were all pronounced differently in early middle chinese; in william h. baxter's transcription they were "dzyip", "zyit", "syik", "dzyek", "dzyi" and "zyik" respectively. they are still pronounced differently in today's cantonese; in jyutping they are "sap9", "sat9", "sik7", "sek9", "si4", "sik9". in modern spoken mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is; yuen ren chao's modern poem lion-eating poet in the stone den exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced "shi". as such, most of these words have been replaced (in speech, if not in writing) with a longer, less-ambiguous compound. only the first one, "ten", normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, "shíjì" / (lit. "actual-connection"); "rènshi" / (lit. "recognize-know"); "shítou" / (lit. "stone-head"); "shíjiān" / (lit. "time-interval"); "shíwù" (lit. "food-thing"). in each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another morpheme, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, "head", "thing"), the purpose of which is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected.
however, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. for example, "shí" alone, not "shítou" /, appears in compounds meaning "stone-", for example, "shígāo" "plaster" (lit. "stone cream"), "shíhuī" "lime" (lit. "stone dust"), "shíkū" "grotto" (lit. "stone cave"), "shíyīng" "quartz" (lit. "stone flower"), "shíyóu" "petroleum" (lit. "stone oil").
most modern varieties of chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character compounds. in some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in "kūlong" from "kǒng" 孔; this is especially common in jin.
chinese morphology is strictly bound to a set number of syllables with a fairly rigid construction. although many of these single-syllable morphemes ("zì", ) can stand alone as individual words, they more often than not form multi-syllabic compounds, known as "cí" (/), which more closely resembles the traditional western notion of a word. a chinese "cí" ("word") can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.
for example:
all varieties of modern chinese are analytic languages, in that they depend on syntax (word order and sentence structure) rather than morphology—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word's function in a sentence. in other words, chinese has very few grammatical inflections—it possesses no tenses, no voices, no numbers (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few articles (i.e., equivalents to "the, a, an" in english).
they make heavy use of grammatical particles to indicate aspect and mood. in mandarin chinese, this involves the use of particles like "le" (perfective), "hái" / ("still"), "yǐjīng" / ("already"), and so on.
chinese has a subject–verb–object word order, and like many other languages of east asia, makes frequent use of the topic–comment construction to form sentences. chinese also has an extensive system of classifiers and measure words, another trait shared with neighboring languages like japanese and korean. other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of chinese include the use of serial verb construction, pronoun dropping and the related subject dropping.
although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.
the entire chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. however chinese characters should not be confused with chinese words. because most chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more chinese words than characters. a more accurate equivalent for a chinese character is the morpheme, as characters represent the smallest grammatical units with individual meanings in the chinese language.
estimates of the total number of chinese words and lexicalized phrases vary greatly. the "hanyu da zidian", a compendium of chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including bone oracle versions. the "zhonghua zihai" (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. the cc-cedict project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. the 2009 version of the webster's digital chinese dictionary (wdcd), based on cc-cedict, contains over 84,000 entries.
the most comprehensive pure linguistic chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volume "hanyu da cidian", records more than 23,000 head chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. the 1999 revised "cihai", a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.
the 7th (2016) edition of "xiandai hanyu cidian", an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard chinese language as used in mainland china, has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.
like any other language, chinese has absorbed a sizable number of loanwords from other cultures. most chinese words are formed out of native chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. however, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.
some early indo-european loanwords in chinese have been proposed, notably "mì" "honey", / "shī" "lion," and perhaps also / "mǎ" "horse", / "zhū" "pig", "quǎn" "dog", and / "é" "goose".
ancient words borrowed from along the silk road since old chinese include "pútáo" "grape", "shíliu"/"shíliú" "pomegranate" and / "shīzi" "lion". some words were borrowed from buddhist scriptures, including "fó" "buddha" and / "púsà" "bodhisattva." other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as "hútòng" "hutong". words borrowed from the peoples along the silk road, such as "grape," generally have persian etymologies. buddhist terminology is generally derived from sanskrit or pāli, the liturgical languages of north india. words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the gobi, mongolian or northeast regions generally have altaic etymologies, such as "pípá", the chinese lute, or "lào"/"luò" "cheese" or "yoghurt", but from exactly which source is not always clear.
modern neologisms are primarily translated into chinese in one of three ways: free translation ("calque", or by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound), or a combination of the two. today, it is much more common to use existing chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and international scientific vocabulary. any latin or greek etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding chinese characters (for example, "anti-" typically becomes "", literally "opposite"), making them more comprehensible for chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. for example, the word "telephone" was loaned phonetically as / (shanghainese: "télífon" , mandarin: "délǜfēng") during the 1920s and widely used in shanghai, but later / "diànhuà" (lit. "electric speech"), built out of native chinese morphemes, became prevalent ( is in fact from the japanese "denwa"; see below for more japanese loans). other examples include / "diànshì" (lit. "electric vision") for television, / "diànnǎo" (lit. "electric brain") for computer; / "shǒujī" (lit. "hand machine") for mobile phone, / "lányá" (lit. "blue tooth") for bluetooth, and / "wǎngzhì" (lit. "internet logbook") for blog in hong kong and macau cantonese. occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as / "hànbǎobāo" ( "hànbǎo" "hamburg" + "bāo" "bun") for "hamburger". sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating chinese morphemes (phono-semantic matching), such as / "tuōlājī" "tractor" (lit. "dragging-pulling machine"), or / mǎlì'ào for the video game character mario. this is often done for commercial purposes, for example / "bēnténg" (lit. "dashing-leaping") for pentium and / "sàibǎiwèi" (lit. "better-than hundred tastes") for subway restaurants.
foreign words, mainly proper nouns, continue to enter the chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. this is done by employing chinese characters with similar pronunciations. for example, "israel" becomes "yǐsèliè", "paris" becomes "bālí". a rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including / "shāfā" "sofa", / "mǎdá" "motor", "yōumò" "humor", / "luóji"/"luójí" "logic", / "shímáo" "smart, fashionable", and "xiēsīdǐlǐ" "hysterics". the bulk of these words were originally coined in the shanghai dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into mandarin, hence their pronunciations in mandarin may be quite off from the english. for example, / "sofa" and / "motor" in shanghainese sound more like their english counterparts. cantonese differs from mandarin with some transliterations, such as "so faa" "sofa" and "mo daa" "motor".
western foreign words representing western concepts have influenced chinese since the 20th century through transcription. from french came "bālěi" "ballet" and "xiāngbīn", "champagne"; from italian, "kāfēi" "caffè". english influence is particularly pronounced. from early 20th century shanghainese, many english words are borrowed, such as / "gāoěrfū" "golf" and the above-mentioned / "shāfā" "sofa". later, the united states soft influences gave rise to "dísikē"/"dísīkē" "disco", / "kělè" "cola", and "mínǐ" "mini [skirt]". contemporary colloquial cantonese has distinct loanwords from english, such as "kaa tung" "cartoon", "gei lou" "gay people", "dik si" "taxi", and "baa si" "bus". with the rising popularity of the internet, there is a current vogue in china for coining english transliterations, for example, / "fěnsī" "fans", "hēikè" "hacker" (lit. "black guest"), and "bókè" "blog". in taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as "hàikè" for "hacker" and "bùluògé" for "blog" (lit. "interconnected tribes").
another result of the english influence on chinese is the appearance in modern chinese texts of so-called / "zìmǔcí" (lit. "lettered words") spelled with letters from the english alphabet. this has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites, and on tv: / "3rd generation cell phones" ( "sān" "three" + g "generation" + / "shǒujī" "mobile phones"), "it circles" (it "information technology" + "jiè" "industry"), hsk ("hànyǔ shuǐpíng kǎoshì", /), gb ("guóbiāo", /), / (cif "cost, insurance, freight" + / "jià" "price"), "e-home" (e "electronic" + "jiātíng" "home"), / "wireless era" (w "wireless" + / "shídài" "era"), "tv watchers" (tv "television" + "zú" "social group; clan"), / "post-pc era" (/ "hòu" "after/post-" + pc "personal computer" + /), and so on.
since the 20th century, another source of words has been japanese using existing kanji (chinese characters used in japanese). japanese re-molded european concepts and inventions into , and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern chinese. other terms were coined by the japanese by giving new senses to existing chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical chinese literature. for example, "jīngjì" (/; "keizai" in japanese), which in the original chinese meant "the workings of the state", was narrowed to "economy" in japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into chinese. as a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the japanese or chinese coined them first. as a result of this loaning, chinese, korean, japanese, and vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from greco-latin and shared among european languages.
the chinese orthography centers on chinese characters, which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns. chinese characters denote morphemes independent of phonetic change. thus the character ("one") is uttered "yī" in standard chinese, "yat" in cantonese and "it" in hokkien (form of min). vocabularies from different major chinese variants have diverged, and colloquial nonstandard written chinese often makes use of unique "dialectal characters", such as and for cantonese and hakka, which are considered archaic or unused in standard written chinese.
written colloquial cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging amongst hong-kongers and cantonese-speakers elsewhere. it is considered highly informal, and does not extend to many formal occasions.
the chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early rime books and dictionaries. early indian translators, working in sanskrit and pali, were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of chinese in a foreign language. after the 15th century, the efforts of jesuits and western court missionaries resulted in some rudimentary latin transcription systems, based on the nanjing mandarin dialect.
in hunan, women in certain areas write their local language in nü shu, a syllabary derived from chinese characters. the dungan language, considered by many a dialect of mandarin, is nowadays written in cyrillic, and was previously written in the arabic script. the dungan people are primarily muslim and live mainly in kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and russia; some of the related hui people also speak the language and live mainly in china.
each chinese character represents a monosyllabic chinese word or morpheme. in 100 ce, the famed han dynasty scholar xu shen classified characters into six categories, namely pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as "rén" (human), "rì" (sun), "shān" (mountain; hill), "shuǐ" (water). between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as "chōng" (pour), combining a phonetic component "zhōng" (middle) with a semantic radical (water). almost all characters created since have been made using this format. the 18th-century kangxi dictionary recognized 214 radicals.
modern characters are styled after the regular script. various other written styles are also used in chinese calligraphy, including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.
there are currently two systems for chinese characters. the traditional system, used in hong kong, taiwan, macau and chinese speaking communities (except singapore and malaysia) outside mainland china, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late han dynasty. the simplified chinese character system, introduced by the people's republic of china in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants.
singapore, which has a large chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the "de facto" standard for younger ethnic chinese in malaysia. the internet provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified.
a well-educated chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a mainland newspaper. the prc government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. school-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000. a large unabridged dictionary, like the kangxi dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.
romanization is the process of transcribing a language into the latin script. there are many systems of romanization for the chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. chinese is first known to have been written in latin characters by western christian missionaries in the 16th century.
today the most common romanization standard for standard chinese is "hanyu pinyin", often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the people's republic of china, and later adopted by singapore and taiwan. pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken chinese in schools and universities across america, australia and europe. chinese parents also use pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. in school books that teach chinese, the pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the chinese character alongside.
the second-most common romanization system, the wade–giles, was invented by thomas wade in 1859 and modified by herbert giles in 1892. as this system approximates the phonology of mandarin chinese into english consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an anglicization, it may be particularly helpful for beginner chinese speakers of an english-speaking background. wade–giles was found in academic use in the united states, particularly before the 1980s, and until 2009 was widely used in taiwan.
when used within european texts, the tone transcriptions in both pinyin and wade–giles are often left out for simplicity; wade–giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. thus, most western readers will be much more familiar with "beijing" than they will be with "běijīng" (pinyin), and with "taipei" than "t'ai²-pei³" (wade–giles). this simplification presents syllables as homophones which really are none, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.
here are a few examples of "hanyu pinyin" and wade–giles, for comparison:
other systems of romanization for chinese include gwoyeu romatzyh, the french efeo, the yale system (invented during wwii for u.s. troops), as well as separate systems for cantonese, min nan, hakka, and other chinese varieties.
chinese varieties have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. the 'phags-pa script, for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of chinese.
zhuyin (colloquially "bopomofo"), a semi-syllabary is still widely used in taiwan's elementary schools to aid standard pronunciation. although zhuyin characters are reminiscent of katakana script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. a comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the zhuyin article. syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:
there are also at least two systems of cyrillization for chinese. the most widespread is the palladius system.
with the growing importance and influence of china's economy globally, mandarin instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the united states, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the western world, as in the uk.
in 1991 there were 2,000 foreign learners taking china's official chinese proficiency test (also known as hsk, comparable to the english cambridge certificate), while in 2005, the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660. by 2010, 750,000 people had taken the chinese proficiency test. by 2017, 6.5 million candidates had taken the chinese proficiency test of various kinds.
according to the modern language association, there were 550 elementary, junior high and senior high schools providing chinese programs in the united states in 2015, which represented a 100% increase in two years. at the same time, enrollment in chinese language classes at college level had an increase of 51% from 2002 to 2015. on the other hand, the american council on the teaching of foreign languages also had figures suggesting that 30,000 – 50,000 students were studying chinese in 2015.
in 2016, more than half a million chinese students pursued post-secondary education overseas, whereas 400,000 international students came to china for higher education. tsinghua university hosted 35,000 students from 116 countries in the same year.
with the increase in demand for chinese as a second language, there are 330 institutions teaching chinese language globally according to the chinese ministry of education. the establishment of confucius institutes, which are the public institutions affiliated with the ministry of education of china, aims at promoting chinese language and culture as well as supporting chinese teaching overseas. there were more than 480 confucius institutes worldwide as of 2014.

complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. it is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including the branches of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and particularly quantum mechanics. by extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering.
as a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions).
complex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics, with roots in the 18th century and just prior. important mathematicians associated with complex numbers include euler, gauss, riemann, cauchy, weierstrass, and many more in the 20th century. complex analysis, in particular the theory of conformal mappings, has many physical applications and is also used throughout analytic number theory. in modern times, it has become very popular through a new boost from complex dynamics and the pictures of fractals produced by iterating holomorphic functions. another important application of complex analysis is in string theory which studies conformal invariants in quantum field theory.
a complex function is a function from complex numbers to complex numbers. in other words, it is a function that has a subset of the complex numbers as a domain and the complex numbers as a codomain. complex functions are generally supposed to have a domain that contains a nonempty open subset of the complex plane.
for any complex function, the values formula_1 from the domain and their images formula_2 in the range may be separated into real and imaginary parts:
where formula_4 are all real-valued.
in other words, a complex function formula_5 may be decomposed into
i.e., into two real-valued functions (formula_8, formula_9) of two real variables (formula_10, formula_11).
similarly, any complex-valued function on an arbitrary set can be considered as an ordered pair of two real-valued functions: or, alternatively, as a vector-valued function from into formula_12
some properties of complex-valued functions (such as continuity) are nothing more than the corresponding properties of vector valued functions of two real variables. other concepts of complex analysis, such as differentiability are direct generalizations of the similar concepts for real functions, but may have very different properties. in particular, every differentiable complex function is analytic (see next section), and two differentiable functions that are equal in a neighborhood of a point are equal on the intersection of their domain (if the domains are connected). the latter property is the basis of the principle of analytic continuation which allows extending every real analytic function in a unique way for getting a complex analytic function whose domain is the whole complex plane with a finite number of curve arcs removed. many basic and special complex functions are defined in this way, including exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions.
complex functions that are differentiable at every point of an open subset formula_13 of the complex plane are said to be "holomorphic" "on" formula_13. in the context of complex analysis, the derivative of formula_15 at formula_16 is defined to be
superficially, this definition is formally analogous to that of the derivative of a real function. however, complex derivatives and differentiable functions behave in significantly different ways compared to their real counterparts. in particular, for this limit to exist, the value of the difference quotient must approach the same complex number, regardless of the manner in which we approach formula_16 in the complex plane. consequently, complex differentiability has much stronger implications than real differentiability. for instance, holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable, whereas the existence of the "n"th derivative need not imply the existence of the ("n" + 1)th derivative for real functions. furthermore, all holomorphic functions satisfy the stronger condition of analyticity, meaning that the function is, at every point in its domain, locally given by a convergent power series. in essence, this means that functions holomorphic on formula_13 can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials in some neighborhood of every point in formula_13. this stands in sharp contrast to differentiable real functions; even infinitely differentiable real functions can be "nowhere" analytic.
most elementary functions, including the exponential function, the trigonometric functions, and all polynomial functions, extended appropriately to complex arguments as functions formula_21, are holomorphic over the entire complex plane, making them "entire" "functions", while rational functions formula_22, where "p" and "q" are polynomials, are holomorphic on domains that exclude points where "q" is zero. such functions that are holomorphic everywhere except a set of isolated points are known as "meromorphic functions". on the other hand, the functions formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25 are not holomorphic anywhere on the complex plane, as can be shown by their failure to satisfy the cauchy–riemann conditions (see below).
an important property of holomorphic functions is the relationship between the partial derivatives of their real and imaginary components, known as the cauchy–riemann conditions. if formula_5, defined by formula_27, where formula_28, is holomorphic on a region formula_13, then "formula_30" must hold for all formula_31. here, the differential operator formula_32 is defined as formula_33"." in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the function, "u" and "v", this is equivalent to the pair of equations formula_34 and formula_35, where the subscripts indicate partial differentiation. however, the cauchy–riemann conditions do not characterize holomorphic functions, without additional continuity conditions (see looman–menchoff theorem).
holomorphic functions exhibit some remarkable features. for instance, picard's theorem asserts that the range of an entire function can only take three possible forms: formula_36, formula_37, or formula_38 for some formula_39. in other words, if two distinct complex numbers formula_1 and formula_41 are not in the range of entire function formula_15, then formula_15 is a constant function. moreover, given a holomorphic function formula_15 defined on an open set formula_45, the analytic continuation of formula_15 to a larger open set formula_47 is unique. as a result, the value of a holomorphic function over an arbitrarily small region in fact determines the value of the function everywhere to which it can be extended as a holomorphic function.
"see also": analytic function, coherent sheaf and vector bundles.
one of the central tools in complex analysis is the line integral. the line integral around a closed path of a function that is holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded by the closed path is always zero, as is stated by the cauchy integral theorem. the values of such a holomorphic function inside a disk can be computed by a path integral on the disk's boundary (as shown in cauchy's integral formula). path integrals in the complex plane are often used to determine complicated real integrals, and here the theory of residues among others is applicable (see methods of contour integration). a "pole" (or isolated singularity) of a function is a point where the function's value becomes unbounded, or "blows up". if a function has such a pole, then one can compute the function's residue there, which can be used to compute path integrals involving the function; this is the content of the powerful residue theorem. the remarkable behavior of holomorphic functions near essential singularities is described by picard's theorem. functions that have only poles but no essential singularities are called meromorphic. laurent series are the complex-valued equivalent to taylor series, but can be used to study the behavior of functions near singularities through infinite sums of more well understood functions, such as polynomials.
a bounded function that is holomorphic in the entire complex plane must be constant; this is liouville's theorem. it can be used to provide a natural and short proof for the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.
if a function is holomorphic throughout a connected domain then its values are fully determined by its values on any smaller subdomain. the function on the larger domain is said to be analytically continued from its values on the smaller domain. this allows the extension of the definition of functions, such as the riemann zeta function, which are initially defined in terms of infinite sums that converge only on limited domains to almost the entire complex plane. sometimes, as in the case of the natural logarithm, it is impossible to analytically continue a holomorphic function to a non-simply connected domain in the complex plane but it is possible to extend it to a holomorphic function on a closely related surface known as a riemann surface.
all this refers to complex analysis in one variable. there is also a very rich theory of complex analysis in more than one complex dimension in which the analytic properties such as power series expansion carry over whereas most of the geometric properties of holomorphic functions in one complex dimension (such as conformality) do not carry over. the riemann mapping theorem about the conformal relationship of certain domains in the complex plane, which may be the most important result in the one-dimensional theory, fails dramatically in higher dimensions.
a major use of certain complex spaces is in quantum mechanics as wave functions.

the earliest known written records of the history of china date from as early as 1250 bc, from the shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 bc), during the king wu ding's reign, who was mentioned as the twenty-first shang king by the same. ancient historical texts such as the "records of the grand historian" (c. 100 bc) and the "bamboo annals" (296 bc) describe a xia dynasty (c. 2070–1600 bc) before the shang, but no writing is known from the period, and shang writings do not indicate the existence of the xia. the shang ruled in the yellow river valley, which is commonly held to be the cradle of chinese civilization. however, neolithic civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the yellow river and yangtze river. these yellow river and yangtze civilizations arose millennia before the shang. with thousands of years of continuous history, china is one of the world's oldest civilizations, and is regarded as one of the cradles of civilization.
the zhou dynasty (1046–256 bc) supplanted the shang, and introduced the concept of the mandate of heaven to justify their rule. the central zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century bc, and the country eventually splintered into smaller states during the spring and autumn period. these states became independent and warred with one another in the following warring states period. much of traditional chinese culture, literature and philosophy first developed during those troubled times.
in 221 bc, qin shi huang conquered the various warring states and created for himself the title of "huangdi" or "emperor" of the qin, marking the beginning of imperial china. however, the oppressive government fell soon after his death, and was supplanted by the longer-lived han dynasty (206 bc – 220 ad). successive dynasties developed bureaucratic systems that enabled the emperor to control vast territories directly. in the 21 centuries from 206 bc until ad 1912, routine administrative tasks were handled by a special elite of "scholar-officials". young men, well-versed in calligraphy, history, literature, and philosophy, were carefully selected through difficult government examinations. china's last dynasty was the qing (1644–1912), which was replaced by the republic of china in 1912, and in the mainland by the people's republic of china in 1949, resulting in two "de facto" states claiming to be the legitimate government of all china.
chinese history has alternated between periods of political unity and peace, and periods of war and failed statehood – the most recent being the chinese civil war (1927–1949). china was occasionally dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were eventually assimilated into the han chinese culture and population. between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of china; in some eras control stretched as far as xinjiang and tibet, as at present. traditional culture, and influences from other parts of asia and the western world (carried by waves of immigration, cultural assimilation, expansion, and foreign contact), form the basis of the modern culture of china.
what is now china was inhabited by "homo erectus" more than a million years ago. recent study shows that the stone tools found at xiaochangliang site are magnetostratigraphically dated to 1.36 million years ago. the archaeological site of xihoudu in shanxi province has evidence of use of fire by "homo erectus", which is dated 1.27 million years ago, and "homo erectus" fossils in china include the yuanmou man, the lantian man and the peking man. fossilised teeth of "homo sapiens" dating to 125,000–80,000 bc have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county in hunan. evidence of middle palaeolithic levallois technology has been found in the lithic assemblage of guanyindong cave site in southwest china, dated to approximately 170,000–80,000 years ago.
the neolithic age in china can be traced back to about 10,000 bc. the earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the yangtze river, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. early evidence for proto-chinese millet agriculture is radiocarbon-dated to about 7000 bc. farming gave rise to the jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 bc). at damaidi in ningxia, 3,172 cliff carvings dating to 6000–5000 bc have been discovered, "featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing". these pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written chinese. chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around 7000 bc, dadiwan from 5800 bc to 5400 bc, damaidi around 6000 bc and banpo dating from the 5th millennium bc. some scholars have suggested that jiahu symbols (7th millennium bc) were the earliest chinese writing system. excavation of a peiligang culture site in xinzheng county, henan, found a community that flourished in 5,500 to 4,900 bc, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. with agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators. in late neolithic times, the yellow river valley began to establish itself as a center of yangshao culture (5000 bc to 3000 bc), and the first villages were founded; the most archaeologically significant of these was found at banpo, xi'an. later, yangshao culture was superseded by the longshan culture, which was also centered on the yellow river from about 3000 bc to 2000 bc.
bronze artifacts have been found at the majiayao culture site (between 3100 and 2700 bc), the bronze age is also represented at the lower xiajiadian culture (2200–1600 bc) site in northeast china. sanxingdui located in what is now sichuan province is believed to be the site of a major ancient city, of a previously unknown bronze age culture (between 2000 and 1200 bc). the site was first discovered in 1929 and then re-discovered in 1986. chinese archaeologists have identified the sanxingdui culture to be part of the ancient kingdom of shu, linking the artifacts found at the site to its early legendary kings.
ferrous metallurgy begins to appear in the late 6th century in the yangzi valley.
a bronze tomahawk with a blade of meteoric iron excavated near the city of gaocheng in shijiazhuang (now hebei province) has been dated to the 14th century bc.
for this reason, authors such as liana chua and mark elliott have used the term "iron age" by convention for the transitional period of c. 500 bc to 100 bc, roughly corresponding to the warring states period of chinese historiography.
an iron age culture of the tibetan plateau has tentatively been associated with the zhang zhung culture described in early tibetan writings.
the xia dynasty of china (from c. 2070 to c. 1600 bc) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as sima qian's "records of the grand historian" and "bamboo annals". the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou, henan in 1959. with few clear records matching the shang oracle bones, it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period. excavations that overlap the alleged time period of the xia indicate a type of culturally similar groupings of chiefdoms. early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestral to modern chinese characters.
according to ancient records, the dynasty ended around 1600 bc as a consequence of the battle of mingtiao.
archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the shang dynasty, c. 1600–1046 bc, are divided into two sets. the first set, from the earlier shang period, comes from sources at erligang, zhengzhou, and shangcheng. the second set, from the later shang or yin (殷) period, is at anyang, in modern-day henan, which has been confirmed as the last of the shang's nine capitals (c. 1300–1046 bc). the findings at anyang include the earliest written record of the chinese so far discovered: inscriptions of divination records in ancient chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals—the "oracle bones", dating from around 1250 bc.
a series of thirty-one kings reigned over the shang dynasty. during their reign, according to the "records of the grand historian", the capital city was moved six times. the final (and most important) move was to yin in 1350 bc which led to the dynasty's golden age. the term yin dynasty has been synonymous with the shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the shang dynasty.
chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the political situation in early china was much more complicated. hence, as some scholars of china suggest, the xia and the shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early zhou existed at the same time as the shang.
although written records found at anyang confirm the existence of the shang dynasty, western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the anyang settlement with the shang dynasty. for example, archaeological findings at sanxingdui suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike anyang. the evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the shang realm extended from anyang. the leading hypothesis is that anyang, ruled by the same shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as china proper.
the zhou dynasty (1046 bc to approximately 256 bc) is the longest-lasting dynasty in chinese history. by the end of the 2nd millennium bc, the zhou dynasty began to emerge in the yellow river valley, overrunning the territory of the shang. the zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system. the zhou lived west of the shang, and the zhou leader was appointed western protector by the shang. the ruler of the zhou, king wu, with the assistance of his brother, the duke of zhou, as regent, managed to defeat the shang at the battle of muye.
the king of zhou at this time invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to legitimize his rule, a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty. like shangdi, heaven ("tian") ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule china. it was believed that a ruler lost the mandate of heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. in response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the mandate of heaven.
the zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern xi'an, on the wei river, a tributary of the yellow river, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the yangtze river valley. this would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in chinese history.
in the 8th century bc, power became decentralized during the spring and autumn period, named after the influential "spring and autumn annals". in this period, local military leaders used by the zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. the situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the qin, forcing the zhou to move their capital east to luoyang. this marks the second major phase of the zhou dynasty: the eastern zhou. the spring and autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central zhou power. in each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the zhou kings in name only. some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves. china now consisted of hundreds of states, some of them only as large as a village with a fort.
as the era continued, larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones. by the 6th century bc most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principalities dominated china. some southern states, such as chu and wu, claimed independence from the zhou, who undertook wars against some of them (wu and yue). many new cities were established in this period and chinese culture was slowly shaped.
once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions, the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the warring states period, which began when the three remaining élite families in the jin state—zhao, wei and han—partitioned the state. many famous individuals such as laozi,  confucius and sun tzu lived during this chaotic period.
the hundred schools of thought of chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as confucianism, taoism, legalism and mohism were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. the first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on chinese culture.
after further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century bc, and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the warring states period. though there remained a nominal zhou king until 256 bc, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.
numerous developments were made during this period in culture and mathematics. examples include an important literary achievement, the zuo zhuan on the "spring and autumn annals", which summarizes the preceding spring and autumn period, and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the tsinghua collection, which was invented during this period dated to 305 bc, are the worlds' earliest example of a two digit decimal multiplication table, indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period.
as neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern sichuan and liaoning, were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of commandery and prefecture. this system had been in use since the spring and autumn period, and parts can still be seen in the modern system of sheng and xian (province and county).
the final expansion in this period began during the reign of ying zheng, the king of qin. his unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of zhejiang, fujian, guangdong and guangxi in 214 bc, enabled him to proclaim himself the first emperor (qin shi huang).
the imperial china period can be divided into three sub-periods: early, middle, and late.
major events in the early sub-period include the qin unification of china and their replacement by the han, the first split followed by the jin unification, and the loss of north china. the middle sub-period was marked by the sui unification and their supplementation by the tang, the second split, and the song unification. the late sub-period included the yuan, ming, and qing dynasties.
historians often refer to the period from the qin dynasty to the end of the qing dynasty as imperial china. though the unified reign of the first qin emperor lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the han chinese homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized legalist government seated at xianyang (close to modern xi'an). the doctrine of legalism that guided the qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. this philosophy, while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime. the qin emperor presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the burning of books and burying of scholars. this would be the impetus behind the later han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.
major contributions of the qin include the concept of a centralized government, and the unification and development of the legal code, the written language, measurement, and currency of china after the tribulations of the spring and autumn and warring states periods. even something as basic as the length of axles for carts—which need to match ruts in the roads—had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire. also as part of its centralization, the qin connected the northern border walls of the states it defeated, making the first great wall of china.
the tribes of the north, collectively called the wu hu by the qin, were free from chinese rule during the majority of the dynasty. prohibited from trading with qin dynasty peasants, the xiongnu tribe living in the ordos region in northwest china often raided them instead, prompting the qin to retaliate. after a military campaign led by general meng tian, the region was conquered in 215 bc and agriculture was established; the peasants, however, were discontented and later revolted. the succeeding han dynasty also expanded into the ordos due to overpopulation, but depleted their resources in the process. indeed, this was true of the dynasty's borders in multiple directions; modern inner mongolia, xinjiang, tibet, manchuria, and regions to the southeast were foreign to the qin, and even areas over which they had military control were culturally distinct.
a major qin innovation that lasted until 1912 was reliance upon a trained intellectual elite, the "scholar-official" ("scholar-gentlemen"). they were civil servants appointed by the emperor to handle daily governance. talented young men were selected through an elaborate process of imperial examination. they had to demonstrate skill at calligraphy, and had to know confucian philosophy. historian wing-tsit chan concludes that:
after emperor qin shi huang's unnatural death due to the consumption of mercury pills, the qin government drastically deteriorated and eventually capitulated in 207 bc after the qin capital was captured and sacked by rebels, which would ultimately lead to the establishment of a new dynasty of a unified china. despite the short 15-year duration of the qin dynasty, it was immensely influential on china and the structure of future chinese dynasties.
the han dynasty was founded by liu bang, who emerged victorious in the chu–han contention that followed the fall of the qin dynasty. a golden age in chinese history, the han dynasty's long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of china as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy, which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennia. during the han dynasty, territory of china was extended to most of the china proper and to areas far west. confucianism was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent chinese civilization. art, culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights. with the profound and lasting impacts of this period of chinese history, the dynasty name "han" had been taken as the name of the chinese people, now the dominant ethnic group in modern china, and had been commonly used to refer to chinese language and written characters. the han dynasty also saw many mathematical innovations being invented such as the method of gaussian elimination which appeared in the chinese mathematical text chapter eight "rectangular arrays" of "the nine chapters on the mathematical art". its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. the first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179 ad, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150 bc, more than 1500 years before the europeans came up with the method in the 18th century.
after the initial laissez-faire policies of emperors wen and jing, the ambitious emperor wu brought the empire to its zenith. to consolidate his power, confucianism, which emphasizes stability and order in a well-structured society, was given exclusive patronage to be the guiding philosophical thoughts and moral principles of the empire. imperial universities were established to support its study and further development, while other schools of thought were discouraged.
major military campaigns were launched to weaken the nomadic xiongnu empire, limiting their influence north of the great wall. along with the diplomatic efforts led by zhang qian, the sphere of influence of the han empire extended to the states in the tarim basin, opened up the silk road that connected china to the west, stimulating bilateral trade and cultural exchange. to the south, various small kingdoms far beyond the yangtze river valley were formally incorporated into the empire.
emperor wu also dispatched a series of military campaigns against the baiyue tribes. the han annexed minyue in 135 bc and 111 bc, nanyue in 111 bc, and dian in 109 bc. migration and military expeditions led to the cultural assimilation of the south. it also brought the han into contact with kingdoms in southeast asia, introducing diplomacy and trade.
after emperor wu, the empire slipped into gradual stagnation and decline. economically, the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects, while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. various consort clans exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of wang mang.
in ad 9, the usurper wang mang claimed that the mandate of heaven called for the end of the han dynasty and the rise of his own, and he founded the short-lived xin ("new") dynasty. wang mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms, including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution. these programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the peasants. the instability of power brought about chaos, uprisings, and loss of territories. this was compounded by mass flooding of the yellow river; silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers. wang mang was eventually killed in weiyang palace by an enraged peasant mob in ad 23.
emperor guangwu reinstated the han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at luoyang, "east" of the former capital xi'an. thus, this new era is termed the eastern han dynasty. with the capable administrations of emperors ming and zhang, former glories of the dynasty was reclaimed, with brilliant military and cultural achievements. the xiongnu empire was decisively defeated. the diplomat and general ban chao further expanded the conquests across the pamirs to the shores of the caspian sea, thus reopening the silk road, and bringing trade, foreign cultures, along with the arrival of buddhism. with extensive connections with the west, the first of several roman embassies to china were recorded in chinese sources, coming from the sea route in ad 166, and a second one in ad 284.
the eastern han dynasty was one of the most prolific era of science and technology in ancient china, notably the historic invention of papermaking by cai lun, and the numerous scientific and mathematical contributions by the famous polymath zhang heng.
by the 2nd century, the empire declined amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between consort clans and eunuchs. the yellow turban rebellion broke out in ad 184, ushering in an era of warlords. in the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the period of the three kingdoms. this time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as "romance of the three kingdoms".
after cao cao reunified the north in 208, his son proclaimed the wei dynasty in 220. soon, wei's rivals shu and wu proclaimed their independence, leading china into the three kingdoms period. this period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the qin and han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families.
in 266, the jin dynasty overthrew the wei and later unified the country in 280, but this union was short-lived.
the jin dynasty was severely weakened by internecine fighting among imperial princes and lost control of northern china after non-han chinese settlers rebelled and captured luoyang and chang'an. in 317, a jin prince in modern-day nanjing became emperor and continued the dynasty, now known as the eastern jin, which held southern china for another century. prior to this move, historians refer to the jin dynasty as the western jin.
northern china fragmented into a series of independent kingdoms, most of which were founded by xiongnu, xianbei, jie, di and qiang rulers. these non-han peoples were ancestors of the turks, mongols, and tibetans. many had, to some extent, been "sinicized" long before their ascent to power. in fact, some of them, notably the qiang and the xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the great wall since late han times. during the period of the sixteen kingdoms, warfare ravaged the north and prompted large-scale han chinese migration south to the yangtze river basin and delta.
in the early 5th century, china entered a period known as the northern and southern dynasties, in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country. in the south, the eastern jin gave way to the liu song, southern qi, liang and finally chen. each of these southern dynasties were led by han chinese ruling families and used jiankang (modern nanjing) as the capital. they held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of chinese civilization, while northern barbarian regimes began to sinify.
in the north, the last of the sixteen kingdoms was extinguished in 439 by the northern wei, a kingdom founded by the xianbei, a nomadic people who unified northern china. the northern wei eventually split into the eastern and western wei, which then became the northern qi and northern zhou. these regimes were dominated by xianbei or han chinese who had married into xianbei families. during this period most xianbei people adopted han surnames, eventually leading to complete assimilation into the han.
despite the division of the country, buddhism spread throughout the land. in southern china, fierce debates about whether buddhism should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. by the end of the era, buddhists and taoists had become much more tolerant of each other.
the short-lived sui dynasty was a pivotal period in chinese history. founded by emperor wen in 581 in succession of the northern zhou, the sui went on to conquer the southern chen in 589 to reunify china, ending three centuries of political division. the sui pioneered many new institutions, including the government system of three departments and six ministries, imperial examinations for selecting officials from commoners, while improved on the systems of fubing system of the army conscription and the equal-field system of land distributions. these policies, which were adopted by later dynasties, brought enormous population growth, and amassed excessive wealth to the state. standardized coinage were enforced throughout the unified empire. buddhism took root as a prominent religion and was supported officially. sui china was known for its numerous mega-construction projects. intended for grains shipment and transporting troops, the grand canal was constructed, linking the capitals daxing (chang'an) and luoyang to the wealthy southeast region, and in another route, to the northeast border. the great wall was also expanded, while series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers further pacified its borders. however, the massive invasions of the korean peninsula during the goguryeo–sui war failed disastrously, triggering widespread revolts that led to the fall of the dynasty.
the tang dynasty was founded by emperor gaozu on 18 june 618. it was a golden age of chinese civilization and considered to be the most prosperous period of china with significant developments in culture, art, literature, particularly poetry, and technology. buddhism became the predominant religion for the common people. chang'an (modern xi'an), the national capital, was the largest city in the world during its time.
the second emperor, taizong, is widely regarded as one of the greatest emperors in chinese history, who had laid the foundation for the dynasty to flourish for centuries beyond his reign. combined military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers were implemented to eliminate threats from nomadic tribes, extend the border, and submit neighboring states into a tributary system. military victories in the tarim basin kept the silk road open, connecting chang'an to central asia and areas far to the west. in the south, lucrative maritime trade routes began from port cities such as guangzhou. there was extensive trade with distant foreign countries, and many foreign merchants settled in china, encouraging a cosmopolitan culture. the tang culture and social systems were observed and imitated by neighboring countries, most notably, japan. internally the grand canal linked the political heartland in chang'an to the agricultural and economic centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire. xuanzang, a chinese buddhist monk, scholar, traveller, and translator who travelled to india on his own, and returned with, "over six hundred mahayana and hinayana texts, seven statues of the buddha and more than a hundred sarira relics."
underlying the prosperity of the early tang dynasty was a strong centralized bureaucracy with efficient policies. the government was organized as "three departments and six ministries" to separately draft, review, and implement policies. these departments were run by royal family members as well as scholar officials who were selected by imperial examinations. these practices, which matured in the tang dynasty, were continued by the later dynasties, with some modifications.
under the tang "equal-field system" all land was owned by the emperor and granted to people according to household size. men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year, a military policy known as the "fubing system". these policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury. by the dynasty's midpoint, however, standing armies had replaced conscription, and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners.
the dynasty continued to flourish under the rule of empress wu zetian, the only empress regnant in chinese history, and reached its zenith during the long reign of emperor xuanzong, who oversaw an empire that stretched from the pacific to the aral sea with at least 50 million people. there were vibrant artistic and cultural creations, including works of the greatest chinese poets, li bai, and du fu.
at the zenith of prosperity of the empire, the an lushan rebellion from 755 to 763 was a watershed event that devastated the population and drastically weakened the central imperial government. upon suppression of the rebellion, regional military governors, known as jiedushi, gained increasingly autonomous status. with loss of revenue from land tax, the central imperial government relied heavily on salt monopoly. externally, former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were irreversibly lost for subsequent centuries. nevertheless, civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.
in late tang period, the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of regional warlords, while internally, as scholar-officials engaged in fierce factional strife, corrupted eunuchs amassed immense power. catastrophically, the huang chao rebellion, from 874 to 884, devastated the entire empire for a decade. the sack of the southern port guangzhou in 879 was followed by the massacre of most of its inhabitants, along with the large foreign merchant enclaves. by 881, both capitals, luoyang and chang'an, fell successively. the reliance on ethnic han and turkic warlords in suppressing the rebellion increased their power and influence. consequently, the fall of the dynasty following zhu wen's usurpation led to an era of division.
according to historian mark edward lewis:
the period of political disunity between the tang and the song, known as the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period, lasted from 907 to 960. during this half-century, china was in all respects a multi-state system. five regimes, namely, (later) liang, tang, jin, han and zhou, rapidly succeeded one another in control of the traditional imperial heartland in northern china. among the regimes, rulers of (later) tang, jin and han were sinicized shatuo turks, which ruled over the ethnic majority of han chinese. more stable and smaller regimes of mostly ethnic han rulers coexisted in south and western china over the period, cumulatively constituted the "ten kingdoms".
amidst political chaos in the north, the strategic sixteen prefectures (region along today's great wall) were ceded to the emerging khitan liao dynasty, which drastically weakened the defense of the china proper against northern nomadic empires. to the south, vietnam gained lasting independence after being a chinese prefecture for many centuries. with wars dominated in northern china, there were mass southward migrations of population, which further enhanced the southward shift of cultural and economic centers in china. the era ended with the coup of later zhou general zhao kuangyin, and the establishment of the song dynasty in 960, which eventually annihilated the remains of the "ten kingdoms" and reunified china.
in 960, the song dynasty was founded by emperor taizu, with its capital established in kaifeng (also known as bianjing). in 979, the song dynasty reunified most of the china proper, while large swaths of the outer territories were occupied by sinicized nomadic empires. the khitan liao dynasty, which lasted from 907 to 1125, ruled over manchuria, mongolia, and parts of northern china. meanwhile, in what are now the north-western chinese provinces of gansu, shaanxi, and ningxia, the tangut tribes founded the western xia dynasty from 1032 to 1227.
aiming to recover the strategic sixteen prefectures lost in the previous dynasty, campaigns were launched against the liao dynasty in the early song period, which all ended in failure. then in 1004, the liao cavalry swept over the exposed north china plain and reached the outskirts of kaifeng, forcing the song's submission and then agreement to the chanyuan treaty, which imposed heavy annual tributes from the song treasury. the treaty was a significant reversal of chinese dominance of the traditional tributary system. yet the annual outflow of song's silver to the liao was paid back through the purchase of chinese goods and products, which expanded the song economy, and replenished its treasury. this dampened the incentive for the song to further campaign against the liao. meanwhile, this cross-border trade and contact induced further sinicization within the liao empire, at the expense of its military might which was derived from its primitive nomadic lifestyle. similar treaties and social-economical consequences occurred in song's relations with the jin dynasty.
within the liao empire, the jurchen tribes revolted against their overlords to establish the jin dynasty in 1115. in 1125, the devastating jin cataphract annihilated the liao dynasty, while remnants of liao court members fled to central asia to found the qara khitai empire (western liao dynasty). jin's invasion of the song dynasty followed swiftly. in 1127, kaifeng was sacked, a massive catastrophe known as the jingkang incident, ending the northern song dynasty. later the entire north of china was conquered. the survived members of song court regrouped in the new capital city of hangzhou, and initiated the southern song dynasty, which ruled territories south of the huai river. in the ensuing years, the territory and population of china were divided between the song dynasty, the jin dynasty and the western xia dynasty. the era ended with the mongol conquest, as western xia fell in 1227, the jin dynasty in 1234, and finally the southern song dynasty in 1279.
despite its military weakness, the song dynasty is widely considered to be the high point of classical chinese civilization. the song economy, facilitated by technology advancement, had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time. the population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production. the capital cities of kaifeng and subsequently hangzhou were both the most populous cities in the world for their time, and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous chinese dynasties. although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires, there were extensive maritime trade with neighboring states, which facilitated the use of song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange. giant wooden vessels equipped with compasses traveled throughout the china seas and northern indian ocean. the concept of insurance was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime shipments. with prosperous economic activities, the historically first use of paper currency emerged in the western city of chengdu, as a supplement to the existing copper coins.
the song dynasty was considered to be the golden age of great advancements in science and technology of china, thanks to innovative scholar-officials such as su song (1020–1101) and shen kuo (1031–1095). inventions such as the hydro-mechanical astronomical clock, the first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain, woodblock printing and paper money were all invented during the song dynasty.
there was court intrigue between the political reformers and conservatives, led by the chancellors wang anshi and sima guang, respectively. by the mid-to-late 13th century, the chinese had adopted the dogma of neo-confucian philosophy formulated by zhu xi. enormous literary works were compiled during the song dynasty, such as the historical work, the "zizhi tongjian" ("comprehensive mirror to aid in government"). the invention of movable-type printing further facilitated the spread of knowledge. culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as "along the river during the qingming festival" and "eighteen songs of a nomad flute", along with great buddhist painters such as the prolific lin tinggui.
the song dynasty was also a period of major innovation in the history of warfare. gunpowder, while invented in the tang dynasty, was first put into use in battlefields by the song army, inspiring a succession of new firearms and siege engines designs. during the southern song dynasty, as its survival hinged decisively on guarding the yangtze and huai river against the cavalry forces from the north, the first standing navy in china was assembled in 1132, with its admiral's headquarters established at dinghai. paddle-wheel warships equipped with trebuchets could launch incendiary bombs made of gunpowder and lime, as recorded in song's victory over the invading jin forces at the battle of tangdao in the east china sea, and the battle of caishi on the yangtze river in 1161.
the advances in civilization during the song dynasty came to an abrupt end following the devastating mongol conquest, during which the population sharply dwindled, with a marked contraction in economy. despite viciously halting mongol advance for more than three decades, the southern song capital hangzhou fell in 1276, followed by the final annihilation of the song standing navy at the battle of yamen in 1279.
the yuan dynasty was formally proclaimed in 1271, when the great khan of mongol, kublai khan, one of the grandsons of genghis khan, assumed the additional title of emperor of china, and considered his inherited part of the mongol empire as a chinese dynasty. in the preceding decades, the mongols had conquered the jin dynasty in northern china, and the southern song dynasty fell in 1279 after a protracted and bloody war. the mongol yuan dynasty became the first conquest dynasty in chinese history to rule the entire china proper and its population as an ethnic minority. the dynasty also directly controlled the mongolian heartland and other regions, inheriting the largest share of territory of the divided mongol empire, which roughly coincided with the modern area of china and nearby regions in east asia. further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the invasions of japan and vietnam. following the previous jin dynasty, the capital of yuan dynasty was established at khanbaliq (also known as dadu, modern-day beijing). the grand canal was reconstructed to connect the remote capital city to economic hubs in southern part of china, setting the precedence and foundation where beijing would largely remain as the capital of the successive regimes that unified china mainland.
after the peace treaty in 1304 that ended a series of mongol civil wars, the emperors of the yuan dynasty were upheld as the nominal great khan (khagan) of the greater mongol empire over other mongol khanates, which nonetheless remained de facto autonomous. the era was known as "pax mongolica", when much of the asian continent was ruled by the mongols. for the first and only time in history, the silk road was controlled entirely by a single state, facilitating the flow of people, trade, and cultural exchange. network of roads and a postal system were established to connect the vast empire. lucrative maritime trade, developed from the previous song dynasty, continued to flourish, with quanzhou and hangzhou emerging as the largest ports in the world. adventurous travelers from the far west, most notably the venetian, marco polo, would have settled in china for decades. upon his return, his detail travel record inspired generations of medieval europeans with the splendors of the far east. the yuan dynasty was the first ancient economy, where paper currency, known at the time as chao, was used as the predominant medium of exchange. its unrestricted issuance in the late yuan dynasty inflicted hyperinflation, which eventually brought the downfall of the dynasty.
while the mongol rulers of the yuan dynasty adopted substantially to chinese culture, their sinicization was of lesser extent compared to earlier conquest dynasties in chinese history. for preserving racial superiority as the conqueror and ruling class, traditional nomadic customs and heritage from the mongolian steppe were held in high regard. on the other hand, the mongol rulers also adopted flexibly to a variety of cultures from many advanced civilizations within the vast empire. traditional social structure and culture in china underwent immense transform during the mongol dominance. large group of foreign migrants settled in china, who enjoyed elevated social status over the majority han chinese, while enriching chinese culture with foreign elements. the class of scholar officials and intellectuals, traditional bearers of elite chinese culture, lost substantial social status. this stimulated the development of culture of the common folks. there were prolific works in zaju variety shows and literary songs (sanqu), which were written in a distinctive poetry style known as qu. novels of vernacular style gained unprecedented status and popularity.
before the mongol invasion, chinese dynasties reported approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people. this major decline is not necessarily due only to mongol killings. scholars such as frederick w. mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease; others such as timothy brook argue that the mongols created a system of enserfment among a huge portion of the chinese populace, causing many to disappear from the census altogether; other historians including william mcneill and david morgan consider that plague was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period. in the 14th century china suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague, estimated to have killed 25 million people, 30% of the population of china.
throughout the yuan dynasty, there was some general sentiment among the populace against the mongol dominance. yet rather than the nationalist cause, it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent governance that triggered widespread peasant uprisings since the 1340s. after the massive naval engagement at lake poyang, zhu yuanzhang prevailed over other rebel forces in the south. he proclaimed himself emperor and founded the ming dynasty in 1368. the same year his northern expedition army captured the capital khanbaliq. the yuan remnants fled back to mongolia and sustained the regime. other mongol khanates in central asia continued to exist after the fall of yuan dynasty in china.
the ming dynasty was founded by zhu yuanzhang in 1368, who proclaimed himself as the hongwu emperor. the capital was initially set at nanjing, and was later moved to beijing from yongle emperor's reign onward.
urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. large urban centers, such as nanjing and beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. in particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. for the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.
despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-confucianism, china under the early ming dynasty was not isolated. foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly japan, increased considerably. chinese merchants explored all of the indian ocean, reaching east africa with the voyages of zheng he.
the hongwu emperor, being the only founder of a chinese dynasty who was also of peasant origin, had laid the foundation of a state that relied fundamentally in agriculture. commerce and trade, which flourished in the previous song and yuan dynasties, were less emphasized. neo-feudal landholdings of the song and mongol periods were expropriated by the ming rulers. land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. private slavery was forbidden. consequently, after the death of the yongle emperor, independent peasant landholders predominated in chinese agriculture. these laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes. towards later era of the ming dynasty, with declining government control, commerce, trade and private industries revived.
the dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. the emperor's role became more autocratic, although hongwu emperor necessarily continued to use what he called the "grand secretariat" to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including memorials (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. it was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.
the yongle emperor strenuously tried to extend china's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to china to present tribute. a large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500 tons. a standing army of 1 million troops was created. the chinese armies conquered and occupied vietnam for around 20 years, while the chinese fleet sailed the china seas and the indian ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of africa. the chinese gained influence in eastern moghulistan. several maritime asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the chinese emperor. domestically, the grand canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade. over 100,000 tons of iron per year were produced. many books were printed using movable type. the imperial palace in beijing's forbidden city reached its current splendor. it was also during these centuries that the potential of south china came to be fully exploited. new crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.
in 1449 esen tayisi led an oirat mongol invasion of northern china which culminated in the capture of the zhengtong emperor at tumu. since then, the ming became on the defensive on the northern frontier, which led to the ming great wall being built. most of what remains of the great wall of china today was either built or repaired by the ming. the brick and granite work was enlarged, the watchtowers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.
at sea, the ming became increasingly isolationist after the death of the yongle emperor. the treasure voyages which sailed indian ocean were discontinued, and the maritime prohibition laws were set in place banning the chinese from sailing abroad. european traders who reached china in the midst of the age of discovery were repeatedly rebuked in their requests for trade, with the portuguese being repulsed by the ming navy at tuen mun in 1521 and again in 1522. domestic and foreign demands for overseas trade, deemed illegal by the state, led to widespread "wokou" piracy attacking the southeastern coastline during the rule of the jiajing emperor (1507–1567), which only subsided after the opening of ports in guangdong and fujian and much military suppression. the portuguese were allowed to settle in macau in 1557 for trade, which remained in portuguese hands until 1999. the dutch entry into the chinese seas was also met with fierce resistance, with the dutch being chased off the penghu islands in the sino-dutch conflicts of 1622–1624 and were forced to settle in taiwan instead. the dutch in taiwan fought with the ming in the battle of liaoluo bay in 1633 and lost, and eventually surrendered to the ming loyalist koxinga in 1662, after the fall of the ming dynasty.
in 1556, during the rule of the jiajing emperor, the shaanxi earthquake killed about 830,000 people, the deadliest earthquake of all time.
the ming dynasty intervened deeply in the japanese invasions of korea (1592–98), which ended with the withdrawal of all invading japanese forces in korea, and the restoration of the joseon dynasty, its traditional ally and tributary state. the regional hegemony of the ming dynasty was preserved at a toll on its resources. coincidentally, with ming's control in manchuria in decline, the manchu (jurchen) tribes, under their chieftain nurhaci, broke away from ming's rule, and emerged as a powerful, unified state, which was later proclaimed as the qing dynasty. it went on to subdue the much weakened korea as its tributary, conquered mongolia, and expanded its territory to the outskirt of the great wall. the most elite army of the ming dynasty was to station at the shanhai pass to guard the last stronghold against the manchus, which weakened its suppression of internal peasants uprisings.
the qing dynasty (1644–1911) was the last imperial dynasty in china. founded by the manchus, it was the second conquest dynasty to rule the territory of china proper, and roughly doubled the territory controlled by the ming. the manchus were formerly known as jurchens, residing in the northeastern part of the ming territory outside the great wall. they emerged as the major threat to the late ming dynasty after nurhaci united all jurchen tribes and declared the founding of the qing dynasty in 1636. the qing dynasty set up the eight banners system that provided the basic framework for the qing military conquest. li zicheng's peasant rebellion captured beijing in 1644 and the chongzhen emperor, the last ming emperor, committed suicide. the manchus allied with the ming general wu sangui to seize beijing, which was made the capital of the qing dynasty. and then proceeded to subdue the ming remnants in the south. the decades of manchu conquest caused enormous loss of lives and the economic scale of china shrank drastically. in total, the qing conquest of the ming (1618–1683) cost as many as 25 million lives. the early manchu emperors combined traditions of central asian rule with confucian norms of traditional chinese government and were considered a chinese dynasty.
the manchus enforced a 'queue order,' forcing han chinese men to adopt the manchu queue hairstyle. officials were required to wear manchu-style clothing "changshan" (bannermen dress and "tangzhuang"), but ordinary han civilians were allowed to wear traditional han clothing. bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor; they had to petition to be removed from banner status. they were considered a form of nobility and were given annual pensions, land, and allotments of cloth.the kangxi emperor ordered the creation of the "kangxi dictionary", the most complete dictionary of chinese characters that had been compiled.
over the next half-century, all areas previously under the ming dynasty were consolidated under the qing. conquests in central asia in the eighteenth century extended territorial control. between 1673 and 1681, the kangxi emperor suppressed the revolt of the three feudatories, an uprising of three generals in southern china who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the previous emperor. in 1683, the qing staged an amphibious assault on southern taiwan, bringing down the rebel kingdom of tungning, which was founded by the ming loyalist koxinga (zheng chenggong) in 1662 after the fall of the southern ming, and had served as a base for continued ming resistance in southern china. the qing defeated the russians at albazin, resulting in the treaty of nerchinsk.
by the end of qianlong emperor's long reign in 1796, the qing empire was at its zenith. the qing ruled more than one-third of the world's population, and had the largest economy in the world. by area it was one of the largest empires ever.
in the 19th century the empire was internally restive and externally threatened by western powers. the defeat by the british empire in the first opium war (1840) led to the treaty of nanking (1842), under which hong kong was ceded to britain and importation of opium (produced by british empire territories) was allowed. opium usage continued to grow in china, adversely affecting societal stability. subsequent military defeats and unequal treaties with other western powers continued even after the fall of the qing dynasty.
internally the taiping rebellion (1851–1864), a quasi-christian religious movement led by the "heavenly king" hong xiuquan, raided roughly a third of chinese territory for over a decade until they were finally crushed in the third battle of nanking in 1864. this was one of the largest wars in the 19th century in terms of troop involvement; there was massive loss of life, with a death toll of about 20 million. a string of civil disturbances followed, including the punti–hakka clan wars, nian rebellion, dungan revolt, and panthay rebellion. all rebellions were ultimately put down, but at enormous cost and with millions dead, seriously weakening the central imperial authority. the banner system that the manchus had relied upon for so long failed: banner forces were unable to suppress the rebels, and the government called upon local officials in the provinces, who raised "new armies", which successfully crushed the challenges to qing authority. china never rebuilt a strong central army, and many local officials became warlords who used military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces.
in response to calamities within the empire and threats from imperialism, the self-strengthening movement was an institutional reform in the second half of the 1800s. the aim was to modernize the empire, with prime emphasis on strengthening the military. however, the reform was undermined by corrupt officials, cynicism, and quarrels within the imperial family. as a result, the "beiyang fleet" were soundly defeated in the first sino-japanese war (1894–1895). the guangxu emperor and the reformists then launched a more comprehensive reform effort, the hundred days' reform (1898), but it was soon overturned by the conservatives under empress dowager cixi in a military coup.
at the turn of the 20th century, the violent boxer rebellion opposed foreign influence in northern china, and attacked chinese christians and missionaries. when boxers entered beijing, the qing government ordered all foreigners to leave. but instead the foreigners and many chinese were besieged in the foreign legations quarter. the eight-nation alliance sent the seymour expedition of japanese, russian, italian, german, french, american, and austrian troops to relieve the siege. the expedition was stopped by the boxers at the battle of langfang and forced to retreat. due to the alliance's attack on the dagu forts, the qing government in response sided with the boxers and declared war on the alliance. there was fierce fighting at tientsin. the alliance formed the second, much larger gaselee expedition and finally reached beijing; the qing government evacuated to xi'an. the boxer protocol ended the war.
frustrated by the qing court's resistance to reform and by china's and their perception of china's weakness, young officials, military officers, and students began to advocate the overthrow of the qing dynasty and the creation of a republic. they were inspired by the revolutionary ideas of sun yat-sen. a revolutionary military uprising, the wuchang uprising, began on 10 october 1911, in wuchang (today part of wuhan). the provisional government of the republic of china was formed in nanking on 12 march 1912. the xinhai revolution ended 2,000 years of dynasty rule in china.
after the success of the overthrow of the qing dynasty, sun yat-sen was declared president, but sun was forced to turn power over to yuan shikai, who commanded the new army and was the prime minister under the qing government, as part of the agreement to let the last qing monarch abdicate and declare the sovereignty inherit (a decision sun would later regret). over the next few years, yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies and declared himself as the emperor of empire of china in late 1915. yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in march 1916 and died in june of that year.
yuan's death in 1916 left a power vacuum in china; the republican government was all but shattered. this ushered in the warlord era, during which much of the country was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders.
in 1919, the may fourth movement began as a response to the terms imposed on china by the treaty of versailles ending world war i, but quickly became a nationwide protest movement about the domestic situation in china. the protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and china refused to sign the treaty of versailles, which had awarded german holdings of shandong to japan. the new culture movement stimulated by the may fourth movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. according to ebrey:
the discrediting of liberal western philosophy amongst leftist chinese intellectuals led to more radical lines of thought inspired by the russian revolution and supported by agents of the comintern sent to china by moscow. this created the seeds for the irreconcilable conflict between the left and right in china that would dominate chinese history for the rest of the century.
in the 1920s, sun yat-sen established a revolutionary base with the name of the "nationalist government (國民政府)" in south china and set out to unite the fragmented nation. with assistance from the soviet union (itself fresh from lenin's takeover), he entered into an alliance with the fledgeling communist party of china. after sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his protégés, chiang kai-shek, seized control of the "kuomintang" (nationalist party or kmt) and succeeded in bringing most of south and central china under its rule in a military campaign known as the northern expedition (1926–1927). having defeated the warlords in the south and central china by military force, chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the north and officially replace the "beiyang government (北洋政府)" with the "nationalist government" as the government's name of china. in 1927, chiang turned on the cpc and relentlessly chased the cpc armies in nra and its leaders out of kmt. in 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the chinese soviet republic, the cpc forces embarked on the long march across china's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at yan'an in shaanxi province. during the long march, the communists reorganized under a new leader, mao zedong (mao tse-tung).
the bitter struggle between the kmt and the cpc continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year-long japanese occupation of various parts of the country (1931–1945). the two chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the japanese in 1937, during the second sino-japanese war (1937–1945), which became a part of world war ii. japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population, including biological warfare (see unit 731) and the three alls policy ("sankō sakusen"), the three alls being: ""kill all, burn all and loot all"".
following the defeat of japan in 1945, the war between the nationalist government forces and the cpc resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. by 1949, the cpc had established control over most of the country "(see chinese civil war)". westad says the communists won the civil war because they made fewer military mistakes than chiang, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, chiang antagonized too many interest groups in china. furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the japanese. meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of chinese nationalism. during the civil war both the nationalists and communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides. these included deaths from forced conscription and massacres. when the nationalist government forces were defeated by cpc forces in mainland china in 1949, the nationalist government retreated to taiwan with its forces, along with chiang and most of the kmt leadership and a large number of their supporters; the nationalist government had taken effective control of taiwan at the end of wwii as part of the overall japanese surrender, when japanese troops in taiwan surrendered to the republic of china troops.
major combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with kuomintang (kmt) pulling out of the mainland, with the government relocating to taipei and maintaining control only over a few islands. the communist party of china was left in control of mainland china. on 1 october 1949, mao zedong proclaimed the people's republic of china. "communist china" and "red china" were two common names for the prc.
the prc was shaped by a series of campaigns and five-year plans. the economic and social plan known as the great leap forward caused an estimated 45 million deaths. mao's government carried out mass executions of landowners, instituted collectivisation and implemented the laogai camp system. execution, deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under mao. in 1966 mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution, which continued until mao's death a decade later. the cultural revolution, motivated by power struggles within the party and a fear of the soviet union, led to a major upheaval in chinese society.
in 1972, at the peak of the sino-soviet split, mao and zhou enlai met us president richard nixon in beijing to establish relations with the united states. in the same year, the prc was admitted to the united nations in place of the republic of china, with permanent membership of the security council.
a power struggle followed mao's death in 1976. the gang of four were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the cultural revolution, marking the end of a turbulent political era in china. deng xiaoping outmaneuvered mao's anointed successor chairman hua guofeng, and gradually emerged as the "de facto" leader over the next few years.
deng xiaoping was the paramount leader of china from 1978 to 1992, although he never became the head of the party or state, and his influence within the party led the country to significant economic reforms. the communist party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the communes were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. in addition, there were many free market areas opened. the most successful free market areas was shenzhen. it is located in guangdong and the property tax free area still exists today. this turn of events marked china's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some as "market socialism", and officially by the communist party of china as "socialism with chinese characteristics". the prc adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982.
in 1989 the death of former general secretary hu yaobang helped to spark the tiananmen square protests of that year, during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. however, they were eventually put down on 4 june when pla troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, with many fatalities. this event was widely reported, and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government. a filmed incident involving the "tank man" was seen worldwide.
cpc general secretary and prc president jiang zemin and prc premier zhu rongji, both former mayors of shanghai, led post-tiananmen prc in the 1990s. under jiang and zhu's ten years of administration, the prc's economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%. the country formally joined the world trade organization in 2001.
although the prc needs economic growth to spur its development, the government began to worry that rapid economic growth was degrading the country's resources and environment. another concern is that certain sectors of society are not sufficiently benefiting from the prc's economic development; one example of this is the wide gap between urban and rural areas. as a result, under former cpc general secretary and president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao, the prc initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome was not known . more than 40 million farmers were displaced from their land, usually for economic development, contributing to 87,000 demonstrations and riots across china in 2005. for much of the prc's population, living standards improved very substantially and freedom increased, but political controls remained tight and rural areas poor.

civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.
civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. it is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.
civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environment, mechanics and other fields.
throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. knowledge was retained in guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. structures, roads, and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.
one of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of archimedes in the 3rd century bc, including archimedes principle, which underpins our understanding of buoyancy, and practical solutions such as archimedes' screw. brahmagupta, an indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century ad, based on hindu-arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.
engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. the earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 bc in ancient egypt, the indus valley civilization, and mesopotamia (ancient iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. during this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing.
until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation, and often used interchangeably. the construction of pyramids in egypt (circa 2700–2500 bc) were some of the first instances of large structure constructions. other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the qanat water management system (the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71 km,) the parthenon by iktinos in ancient greece (447–438 bc), the appian way by roman engineers (c. 312 bc), the great wall of china by general meng t'ien under orders from ch'in emperor shih huang ti (c. 220 bc) and the stupas constructed in ancient sri lanka like the jetavanaramaya and the extensive irrigation works in anuradhapura. the romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially aqueducts, insulae, harbors, bridges, dams and roads.
in the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering. the first self-proclaimed civil engineer was john smeaton, who constructed the eddystone lighthouse. in 1771 smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the smeatonian society of civil engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.in 1818 the institution of civil engineers was founded in london, and in 1820 the eminent engineer thomas telford became its first president. the institution received a royal charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. its charter defined civil engineering as:
the first private college to teach civil engineering in the united states was norwich university, founded in 1819 by captain alden partridge. the first degree in civil engineering in the united states was awarded by rensselaer polytechnic institute in 1835. the first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by cornell university to nora stanton blatch in 1905.
in the uk during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering and military engineering (served by the royal military academy, woolwich), coupled with the demands of the industrial revolution, spawned new engineering education initiatives: the class of civil engineering and mining was founded at king's college london in 1838, mainly as a response to the growth of the railway system and the need for more qualified engineers, the private college for civil engineers in putney was established in 1839, and the uk's first chair of engineering was established at the university of glasgow in 1840.
"civil engineers" typically possess an academic degree in civil engineering. the length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a bachelor of technology, or a bachelor of engineering. the curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, project management, design and specific topics in civil engineering. after taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. while an undergraduate degree (beng/bsc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (meng/msc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.
in most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification, and a professional body certifies the degree program. after completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements including work experience and exam requirements before being certified. once certified, the engineer is designated as a professional engineer (in the united states, canada and south africa), a chartered engineer (in most commonwealth countries), a chartered professional engineer (in australia and new zealand), or a european engineer (in most countries of the european union). there are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.
the benefits of certification vary depending upon location. for example, in the united states and canada, "only a licensed professional engineer may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients." this requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the engineers act in quebec.no such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the united kingdom. in australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of queensland. almost all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics which all members must abide by.
engineers must obey contract law in their contractual relationships with other parties. in cases where an engineer's work fails, they may be subject to the law of tort of negligence, and in extreme cases, criminal charges. an engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and environmental law.
there are a number of sub-disciplines within the broad field of civil engineering. general civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, pavement, water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. general civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.
"coastal engineering" is concerned with managing coastal areas. in some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. the term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.
"construction engineering" involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. as construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating logistical operations, and monitoring prices of supplies.
"earthquake engineering" involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. the main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to perform at earthquake in compliance with building codes.
"environmental engineering" is the contemporary term for sanitary engineering, though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.
environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and remediation of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, water purification, waste water treatment, air pollution, solid waste treatment, and hazardous waste management. environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, green engineering, and industrial ecology. environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.
"forensic engineering" is the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. the consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. the field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. the subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. generally the purpose of a forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. it can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially patents.
"geotechnical engineering" studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. knowledge from the field of soil science, materials science, mechanics, and hydraulics is applied to safely and economically design foundations, retaining walls, and other structures. environmental efforts to protect groundwater and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.
identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. boundary conditions are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on investigation. furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear (stress-dependent) strength, stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying soil mechanics all the more difficult. geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional geologists and soil scientists.
"materials science" is closely related to civil engineering. it studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and thermosetting polymers including polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) and carbon fibers.
"materials engineering" involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. it incorporates elements of applied physics and chemistry. with recent media attention on nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. it is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis.
"structural engineering" is concerned with the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. this involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. the loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. the structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be "serviceable"). due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.
design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and sustainability.
"surveying" is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the earth. surveying equipment such as levels and theodolites are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. with computerisation, electronic distance measurement (edm), total stations, gps surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the earth's surface in the form of a map. this information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures.
although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.
in the united states, canada, the united kingdom and most commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. land surveyors are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. the services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as cadastral surveying.
construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. construction surveyors perform the following tasks:
"transportation engineering" is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. this involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, rail systems, airports, ports, and mass transit. it includes areas such as transportation design, transportation planning, traffic engineering, some aspects of urban engineering, queueing theory, pavement engineering, intelligent transportation system (its), and infrastructure management.
"municipal engineering" is concerned with municipal infrastructure. this involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, street lighting, municipal solid waste management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), public parks and cycling infrastructure. in the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. it can also include the optimizing of waste collection and bus service networks. some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority. municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)
"water resources engineering" is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a natural resource). as a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, meteorology, conservation, and resource management. this area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground (aquifers) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.
"hydraulic engineering" is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. this area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of pipelines, water supply network, drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, channels, culverts, levees, storm sewers), and canals. hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of fluid pressure, fluid statics, fluid dynamics, and hydraulics, among others.
civil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. it posits that the proper development of civil engineering infrastructure requires a holistic, coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering project life cycle from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.

cantonese is a language originating in guangzhou city, southern china.
cantonese may also refer to:

çatalhöyük (; also "çatal höyük" and "çatal hüyük"; from turkish "çatal" "fork" + "höyük" "tumulus") was a very large neolithic and chalcolithic proto-city settlement in southern anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 bc to 5700 bc, and flourished around 7000 bc. in july 2012, it was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site.
çatalhöyük is located overlooking the konya plain, southeast of the present-day city of konya (ancient iconium) in turkey, approximately 140 km (87 mi) from the twin-coned volcano of mount hasan. the eastern settlement forms a mound which would have risen about 20 m (66 ft) above the plain at the time of the latest neolithic occupation. there is also a smaller settlement mound to the west and a byzantine settlement a few hundred meters to the east. the prehistoric mound settlements were abandoned before the bronze age. a channel of the çarşamba river once flowed between the two mounds, and the settlement was built on alluvial clay which may have been favorable for early agriculture.
the site was first excavated by james mellaart in 1958. he later led a team which further excavated there for four seasons between 1961 and 1965. these excavations revealed this section of anatolia as a centre of advanced culture in the neolithic period. excavation revealed 18 successive layers of buildings signifying various stages of the settlement and eras of history. the bottom layer of buildings can be dated as early as 7100 bc while the top layer is of 5600 bc.
mellaart was banned from turkey for his involvement in the dorak affair in which he published drawings of supposedly important bronze age artifacts that later went missing. after this scandal, the site lay idle until 1993, when investigations began under the leadership of ian hodder, then at the university of cambridge. these investigations are among the most ambitious excavation projects currently in progress according to archaeologist colin renfrew, among others. in addition to extensive use of archaeological science, psychological and artistic interpretations of the symbolism of the wall paintings have been employed. hodder, a former student of mellaart, chose the site as the first "real world" test of his then-controversial theory of post-processual archaeology. the site has always had a strong research emphasis upon engagement with digital methodologies, driven by the project's experimental and reflexive methodological framework. sponsors and collaborators of the current dig include yapi kredi, boeing, university of york, selçuk university, british institute at ankara, cardiff university, stanford university, turkish cultural foundation, and university at buffalo.
çatalhöyük was composed entirely of domestic buildings, with no obvious public buildings. while some of the larger ones have rather ornate murals, the purpose of some rooms remains unclear.
the population of the eastern mound has been estimated to be, at maximum, 10,000 people, but the population likely varied over the community's history. an average population of between 5,000 and 7,000 is a reasonable estimate. the sites were set up as large numbers of buildings clustered together. households looked to their neighbors for help, trade, and possible marriage for their children. the inhabitants lived in mudbrick houses that were crammed together in an aggregate structure. no footpaths or streets were used between the dwellings, which were clustered in a honeycomb-like maze. most were accessed by holes in the ceiling and doors on the side of the houses, with doors reached by ladders and stairs. the rooftops were effectively streets. the ceiling openings also served as the only source of ventilation, allowing smoke from the houses' open hearths and ovens to escape.
houses had plaster interiors characterized by squared-off timber ladders or steep stairs. these were usually on the south wall of the room, as were cooking hearths and ovens. the main rooms contained raised platforms that may have been used for a range of domestic activities. typical houses contained two rooms for everyday activity, such as cooking and crafting. all interior walls and platforms were plastered to a smooth finish. ancillary rooms were used as storage, and were accessed through low openings from main rooms.
all rooms were kept scrupulously clean. archaeologists identified very little rubbish in the buildings, finding middens outside the ruins, with sewage and food waste, as well as significant amounts of ash from burning wood, reeds and animal dung. in good weather, many daily activities may also have taken place on the rooftops, which may have formed a plaza. in later periods, large communal ovens appear to have been built on these rooftops. over time, houses were renewed by partial demolition and rebuilding on a foundation of rubble, which was how the mound was gradually built up. as many as eighteen levels of settlement have been uncovered.
as a part of ritual life, the people of çatalhöyük buried their dead within the village. human remains have been found in pits beneath the floors and, especially, beneath hearths, the platforms within the main rooms, and under beds. bodies were tightly flexed before burial and were often placed in baskets or wound and wrapped in reed mats. disarticulated bones in some graves suggest that bodies may have been exposed in the open air for a time before the bones were gathered and buried. in some cases, graves were disturbed, and the individual's head removed from the skeleton. these heads may have been used in rituals, as some were found in other areas of the community. in a woman's grave spinning whorls were recovered and in a man's grave, stone axes. some skulls were plastered and painted with ochre to recreate faces, a custom more characteristic of neolithic sites in syria and at neolithic jericho than at sites closer by.
vivid murals and figurines are found throughout the settlement, on interior and exterior walls. distinctive clay figurines of women, notably the seated woman of çatalhöyük, have been found in the upper levels of the site. although no identifiable temples have been found, the graves, murals, and figurines suggest that the people of çatalhöyük had a religion rich in symbols. rooms with concentrations of these items may have been shrines or public meeting areas. predominant images include men with erect phalluses, hunting scenes, red images of the now extinct aurochs (wild cattle) and stags, and vultures swooping down on headless figures. relief figures are carved on walls, such as of lionesses facing one another.
heads of animals, especially of cattle, were mounted on walls. a painting of the village, with the twin mountain peaks of hasan dağ in the background, is frequently cited as the world's oldest map, and the first landscape painting. however, some archaeologists question this interpretation. stephanie meece, for example, argues that it is more likely a painting of a leopard skin instead of a volcano, and a decorative geometric design instead of a map.
a striking feature of çatalhöyük are its female figurines. mellaart, the original excavator, argued that these well-formed, carefully made figurines, carved and molded from marble, blue and brown limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and clay, represented a female deity. although a male deity existed as well, "statues of a female deity far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after level vi". to date, eighteen levels have been identified. these artfully-hewn figurines were found primarily in areas mellaart believed to be shrines. the stately goddess seated on a throne flanked by two lionesses ("illustration") was found in a grain bin, which mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply. in later cultures, similar depictions are seen of cybele, a mountain goddess.
whereas mellaart excavated nearly two hundred buildings in four seasons, the current excavator, ian hodder, spent an entire season excavating one building alone. hodder and his team, in 2004 and 2005, began to believe that the patterns suggested by mellaart were false. they found one similar figurine, but the vast majority did not imitate the mother goddess style that mellaart suggested. instead of a mother goddess culture, hodder points out that the site gives little indication of a matriarchy or patriarchy.
in an article in the "turkish daily news", hodder is reported as denying that çatalhöyük was a matriarchal society and quoted as saying "when we look at what they eat and drink and at their social statues, we see that men and women had the same social status. there was a balance of power. another example is the skulls found. if one's social status was of high importance in çatalhöyük, the body and head were separated after death. the number of female and male skulls found during the excavations is almost equal." in another article in the "hurriyet daily news" hodder is reported to say "we have learned that men and women were equally approached".
in a report in september 2009 on the discovery of around 2000 figurines hodder is quoted as saying:
çatalhöyük was excavated in the 1960s in a methodical way, but not using the full range of natural science techniques that are available to us today. sir james mellaart who excavated the site in the 1960s came up with all sorts of ideas about the way the site was organized and how it was lived in and so on ... we’ve now started working there since the mid 1990s and come up with very different ideas about the site. one of the most obvious examples of that is that çatalhöyük is perhaps best known for the idea of the mother goddess. but our work more recently has tended to show that in fact there is very little evidence of a mother goddess and very little evidence of some sort of female-based matriarchy. that's just one of the many myths that the modern scientific work is undermining.
professor lynn meskell explained that while the original excavations had found only 200 figures, the new excavations had uncovered 2,000 figurines of which most were animals, with less than 5% of the figurines women.
estonian folklorist uku masing has suggested as early as in 1976, that çatalhöyük was probably a hunting and gathering religion and the mother goddess figurine did not represent a female deity. he implied that perhaps a longer period of time was needed in order to develop symbols for agricultural rites. his theory was developed in the paper "some remarks on the mythology of the people of catal hüyük".
çatalhöyük has strong evidence of an egalitarian society, as no houses with distinctive features (belonging to royalty or religious hierarchy, for example) have been found so far. the most recent investigations also reveal little social distinction based on gender, with men and women receiving equivalent nutrition and seeming to have equal social status, as typically found in paleolithic cultures. children observed domestic areas. they learned how to perform rituals and how to build or repair houses by watching the adults make statues, beads and other objects.
çatalhöyük's spatial layout may be due to the close kin relations exhibited amongst the people. it can be seen, in the layout, that the people were "divided into two groups who lived on opposite sides of the town, separated by a gully." furthermore, because no nearby towns were found from which marriage partners could be drawn, "this spatial separation must have marked two intermarrying kinship groups." this would help explain how a settlement so early on would become so large.
in upper levels of the site, it becomes apparent that the people of çatalhöyük were gaining skills in agriculture and the domestication of animals. female figurines have been found within bins used for storage of cereals, such as wheat and barley, and the figurines are presumed to be of a deity protecting the grain. peas were also grown, and almonds, pistachios, and fruit were harvested from trees in the surrounding hills. sheep were domesticated and evidence suggests the beginning of cattle domestication as well. however, hunting continued to be a major source of food for the community. pottery and obsidian tools appear to have been major industries; obsidian tools were probably both used and also traded for items such as mediterranean sea shells and flint from syria. there is also evidence that the settlement was the first place in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of lead. noting the lack of hierarchy and economic inequality, historian murray bookchin has argued that çatalhöyük was an early example of anarcho-communism.

clement richard attlee, 1st earl attlee, (3 january 1883 – 8 october 1967), was a british statesman and labour party politician who served as prime minister of the united kingdom from 1945 to 1951.
he was the leader of the labour party from 1935 to 1955. in 1940, attlee took labour into the wartime coalition government and served under winston churchill, becoming, in 1942, the first person to hold the office of deputy prime minister of the united kingdom. he went on to lead the labour party to an unexpected landslide victory at the 1945 general election; forming the first labour majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms. the 12 percent national swing from the conservatives to labour was unprecedented at that time and remains the largest ever achieved by any party at a general election in british electoral history. he was re-elected with a narrow majority at the 1950 general election. in the following year, attlee called a snap general election, hoping to increase his parliamentary majority. however, he was narrowly defeated by the conservatives under the leadership of winston churchill, despite winning the most votes of any political party in any general election in british political history until the conservative party's fourth consecutive victory in 1992. attlee remains the longest-ever serving leader of the labour party.
first elected to the house of commons in 1922 as the mp for limehouse, attlee rose quickly to become a junior minister in the first labour minority government led by ramsay macdonald in 1924, and then joined the cabinet during macdonald's second ministry of 1929–1931. one of only a handful of labour frontbenchers to retain his seat in the landslide defeat of 1931, he became the party's deputy leader. after the resignation of george lansbury in 1935, he was elected as leader of the labour party and leader of the opposition in the subsequent leadership election. at first advocating pacificism and opposing rearmament, he later reversed his position; by 1938, he became a strong critic of neville chamberlain's attempts to appease adolf hitler and benito mussolini. he took labour into the churchill war ministry in 1940. initially serving as lord privy seal, he was appointed as deputy prime minister in 1942. attlee and churchill worked together very smoothly, with attlee working backstage to handle much of the detail and organisational work in parliament, as churchill took centre stage with his attention on diplomacy, military policy, and broader issues. with victory in europe in may 1945, the coalition government was dissolved. attlee led labour to win a huge majority in the ensuing 1945 general election two months later.
the government he led built the post-war consensus, based upon the assumption that full employment would be maintained by keynesian policies and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created – aspirations that had been outlined in the 1942 beveridge report. within this context, his government undertook the nationalisation of public utilities and major industries, as well as the creation of the national health service. attlee himself had little interest in economic matters but this settlement was broadly accepted by all parties for three decades. foreign policy was the special domain of ernest bevin, but attlee took special interest in india. he supervised the process by which india was partitioned into india and pakistan in 1947. he also arranged the independence of burma (myanmar), and ceylon (sri lanka). his government ended the british mandates of palestine and jordan. from 1947 onwards, he and bevin pushed the united states to take a more vigorous role in the emerging cold war against soviet communism. when the budgetary crisis forced britain out of greece in 1947, he called on washington to counter the communists with the truman doctrine. he avidly supported the marshall plan to rebuild western europe with american money. in 1949, he promoted the nato military alliance against the soviet bloc. he sent british troops to fight in the malayan emergency in 1948 and sent the raf to participate in the berlin airlift. he commissioned an independent nuclear deterrent for the uk. he used 13,000 troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the london dock strike in 1949. after leading labour to a narrow victory at the 1950 general election, he sent british troops to fight in the korean war. attlee was narrowly defeated by the conservatives under churchill in the 1951 general election. he continued as labour leader but had lost his effectiveness by then. he retired after losing the 1955 general election and was elevated to the house of lords.
in public, attlee was modest and unassuming; he was ineffective at public relations and lacked charisma. his strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity, and pragmatism proved decisive. though his appointment as prime minister owed more to luck and the unsuitability of his rivals than his own ambitions, he saw himself as spokesman on behalf of his entire party and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. attlee is consistently rated by scholars, critics and the public as one of the greatest british prime ministers. his reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as prime minister, thanks to his roles in leading the labour party, creating the welfare state and building the coalition opposing stalin in the cold war.
attlee was born on 3 january 1883 in putney, surrey (now part of london), into a middle-class family, the seventh of eight children. his father was henry attlee (1841–1908), a solicitor, and his mother was ellen bravery watson (1847–1920), daughter of thomas simons watson, secretary for the art union of london. he was educated at northaw school, a boys' preparatory school near pluckley in kent; haileybury college; and university college, oxford, where in 1904 he graduated as a bachelor of arts with second-class honours in modern history.
attlee then trained as a barrister at the inner temple and was called to the bar in march 1906. he worked for a time at his father's law firm druces and attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession. he also played football for non-league club fleet.
in 1906, he became a volunteer at haileybury house, a charitable club for working-class boys in stepney in the east end of london run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. until then, his political views had been more conservative. however, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the slum children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and income redistribution by the state would have any serious effect. this sparked a process that caused him to convert to socialism. he subsequently joined the independent labour party (ilp) in 1908 and became active in local politics. in 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ilp candidate for stepney borough council.
he also worked briefly as a secretary for beatrice webb in 1909, before becoming a secretary for toynbee hall. in 1911, he was employed by the uk government as an "official explainer"—touring the country to explain chancellor of the exchequer david lloyd george's national insurance act. he spent the summer of that year touring essex and somerset on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. a year later, he became a lecturer at the london school of economics.
following the outbreak of the first world war in august 1914, attlee applied to join the british army. initially his application was turned down, as at age 31 he was seen as too old; however, he was finally allowed to join in september, and was commissioned in the rank of captain with the 6th (service) battalion, south lancashire regiment, part of the 38th brigade of the 13th (western) division, and was sent to fight in the gallipoli campaign in turkey. his decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother tom, who, as a conscientious objector, spent much of the war in prison.
after a period fighting in gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with dysentery and was put on a ship bound for england to recover. when he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in malta where he stayed in hospital to recover. his hospitalisation coincided with the battle of sari bair, which saw a large number of his comrades killed. upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the evacuation of suvla. as such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from suvla bay, the last being general stanley maude.
the gallipoli campaign had been engineered by the first lord of the admiralty, winston churchill. although it was unsuccessful, attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been a success if it had been better implemented on the ground. this gave him an admiration for churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.
he later served in the mesopotamian campaign in what is now iraq, where in april 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by shrapnel while storming an enemy trench during the battle of hanna. he was sent firstly to india, and then back to the uk to recover. in february 1917, he was promoted to the rank of major, leading him to be known as "major attlee" for much of the inter-war period. he would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in england. from 2 to 9 july 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer (co) of the newly formed l (later 10th) battalion, the tank corps at bovington camp, dorset. from 9 july, he assumed command of 30th company of the same battalion however he did not deploy to france with it in december 1917.
after fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to france in june 1918 to serve on the western front for the final months of the war. after being discharged from the army in january 1919, he returned to stepney, and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the london school of economics.
attlee met violet millar while on a long trip with friends to italy in 1921. they bonded immediately and were soon engaged, marrying at christ church, hampstead, on 10 january 1922. it would come to be a devoted marriage, with attlee providing protection and violet providing a home that was an escape for attlee from political turmoil. she died in 1964. they had four children:
attlee returned to local politics in the immediate post-war period, becoming mayor of the metropolitan borough of stepney, one of london's most deprived inner-city boroughs, in 1919. during his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle slum landlords who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. the council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. it also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.
in 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, "the social worker", which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. the book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. he wrote on page 30:in a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.
and went on to say at page 75:charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. a right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.
in 1921, george lansbury, the labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of poplar, and future labour party leader, launched the poplar rates rebellion; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the london boroughs. attlee, who was a personal friend of lansbury strongly supported this, however herbert morrison, the labour mayor of nearby hackney, and one of the main figures in the london labour party, strongly denounced lansbury and the rebellion. during this period, attlee developed a lifelong dislike of morrison.
at the 1922 general election, attlee became the member of parliament (mp) for the constituency of limehouse in stepney. at the time, he admired ramsay macdonald and helped him get elected as labour party leader at the 1922 leadership election. he served as macdonald's parliamentary private secretary for the brief 1922 parliament. his first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as under-secretary of state for war in the short-lived first labour government, led by macdonald.
attlee opposed the 1926 general strike, believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. however, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. at the time of the strike, he was chairman of the stepney borough electricity committee. he negotiated a deal with the electrical trade union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. one firm, scammell and nephew ltd, took a civil action against attlee and the other labour members of the committee (although not against the conservative members who had also supported this). the court found against attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay £300 damages. the decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced attlee out of politics.
in 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party simon commission, a royal commission set up to examine the possibility of granting self-rule to india. due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise macdonald made to attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the second labour government, which entered office after the 1929 general election. attlee's service on the commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to india and many of its political leaders. by 1933 he argued that british rule was alien to india and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for india's progress. he became the british leader most sympathetic to indian independence (as a dominion), preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947.
in may 1930, labour mp oswald mosley left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem, and attlee was given mosley's post of chancellor of the duchy of lancaster. in march 1931, he became postmaster general, a post he held for five months until august, when the labour government fell, after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the great depression. that month macdonald and a few of his allies formed a national government with the conservatives and liberals, leading them to be expelled from labour. macdonald offered attlee a job in the national government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main labour party.
after ramsay macdonald formed the national government, labour was deeply divided. attlee had long been close to macdonald and now felt betrayed—as did most labour politicians. during the course of the second labour government, attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with macdonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. he would write:
in the old days i had looked up to macdonald as a great leader. he had a fine presence and great oratorical power. the unpopular line which he took during the first world war seemed to mark him as a man of character. despite his mishandling of the red letter episode, i had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. i then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior minister, the poor opinion he had of all his cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. i had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... the shock to the party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.
the 1931 general election held later that year was a disaster for the labour party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 mps to parliament. the vast majority of the party's senior figures lost their seats, including the leader arthur henderson, attlee narrowly retained his limehouse seat in the election, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. he was one of only three labour mps who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with george lansbury and stafford cripps, accordingly lansbury was elected leader unopposed with attlee as his deputy.
most of the remaining labour mps after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, lansbury was in his 70s, and stafford cripps another main figure of the labour front bench who had entered parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. as one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining labour mps, attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the national government in the years 1931–35, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.
attlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from december 1933, after lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised attlee's public profile considerably. it was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced attlee to quit politics altogether. his wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the leader of the opposition. on the verge of resigning from parliament, he was persuaded to stay by stafford cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until lansbury could take over again.
during 1932–33 attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by stafford cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the socialist league, which had been formed by former independent labour party (ilp) members, who opposed the ilp's disaffiliation from the main labour party in 1932. at one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. he admired oliver cromwell's strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control england. after looking more closely at hitler, mussolini, stalin, and even his former colleague oswald mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in britain, attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the league, and argued instead that the labour party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against totalitarianism of either the left or right. he always supported the crown, and as prime minister was close to king george vi.
george lansbury, a committed pacifist, resigned as the leader of the labour party at the 1935 party conference on 8 october, after delegates voted in favour of sanctions against italy for its aggression against abyssinia. lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. taking advantage of the disarray in the labour party, the prime minister stanley baldwin announced on 19 october that a general election would be held on 14 november. with no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election. attlee therefore led labour through the 1935 election, which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.
attlee stood in the subsequent leadership election, held soon after, where he was opposed by herbert morrison, who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and arthur greenwood: morrison was seen as the favourite, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. arthur greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party; however his leadership bid was severely hampered by his alcohol problem. attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. he went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected leader of the labour party on 3 december 1935.
throughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the labour party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the league of nations. at the 1934 labour party conference, attlee declared that, "we have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. we are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. we say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." during a debate on defence in commons a year later, attlee said "we are told (in the white paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. we do not think you can do it by national defence. we think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. a world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. i shall be told that that is quite impossible." shortly after those comments, adolf hitler proclaimed that german rearmament offered no threat to world peace. attlee responded the next day noting that hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the soviet union, created "a chance to call a halt in the armaments race...we do not think that our answer to herr hitler should be just rearmament. we are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position."
in april 1936, the chancellor of the exchequer, neville chamberlain, introduced a budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying:
in june 1936, the conservative mp duff cooper called for an anglo-french alliance against possible german aggression and called for all parties to support one. attlee condemned this: "we say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind—an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity—is contrary to the spirit of the league of nations, is contrary to the covenant, is contrary to locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this government." at the labour party conference at edinburgh in october attlee reiterated that "there can be no question of our supporting the government in its rearmament policy."
however, with the rising threat from nazi germany, and the ineffectiveness of the league of nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. by 1937, labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose neville chamberlain's policy of appeasement.
in 1938, attlee opposed the munich agreement, in which chamberlain negotiated with hitler to give germany the german-speaking parts of czechoslovakia, the sudetenland: we all feel relief that war has not come this time. every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. we have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. we have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. we have felt humiliation. this has not been a victory for reason and humanity. it has been a victory for brute force. at every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. the terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. we have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. we have seen something more. we have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... the events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and france have ever sustained. there can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for herr hitler. without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in europe which germany failed to win after four years of war. he has overturned the balance of power in europe. he has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in eastern europe which stood in the way of his ambition. he has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.
at the end of 1937, attlee and a party of three labour mps visited spain and visited the british battalion of the international brigades fighting in the spanish civil war. one of the companies was named the "major attlee company" in his honour.
in 1937, attlee wrote a book entitled "the labour party in perspective" that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views. he argued that there was no point in labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success:
i find that the proposition often reduces itself to this – that if the labour party would drop its socialism and adopt a liberal platform, many liberals would be pleased to support it. i have heard it said more than once that if labour would only drop its policy of nationalisation everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. i am convinced it would be fatal for the labour party.
he also wrote that there was no point in "watering down labour's socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. on the contrary, i believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support". in the late 1930s, attlee sponsored a jewish mother and her two children, enabling them to leave germany in 1939 and move to the uk. on arriving in britain, attlee invited one of the children into his home in stanmore, north-west london, where he stayed for several months.
attlee remained as leader of the opposition when the second world war broke out in september 1939. the ensuing disastrous norwegian campaign would result in a motion of no confidence in neville chamberlain. although chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a coalition government would be necessary. even if attlee had personally been prepared to serve under chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry labour with him. consequently, chamberlain tendered his resignation, and labour and the conservatives entered a coalition government led by winston churchill on 10 may 1940.
attlee and churchill quickly agreed that the war cabinet would consist of three conservatives (initially churchill, chamberlain and lord halifax) and two labour members (initially himself and arthur greenwood) and that labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government. attlee and greenwood played a vital role in supporting churchill during a series of war cabinet debates over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with hitler following the fall of france in may 1940; both supported churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the war cabinet to continue britain's resistance.
only attlee and churchill remained in the war cabinet from the formation of the government of national unity in may 1940 through to the election in may 1945. attlee was initially the lord privy seal, before becoming britain's first ever deputy prime minister in 1942, as well as becoming the dominions secretary and the lord president of the council.
attlee himself played a generally low key but vital role in the wartime government, working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government. in the coalition government, three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. churchill chaired the first two, the war cabinet and the defence committee, with attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in parliament when churchill was absent. attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the lord president's committee, which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. as churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. he also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between labour and conservative ministers.
many labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma; beatrice webb wrote in her diary in early 1940:
following the defeat of nazi germany and the end of the war in europe in may 1945, attlee and churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until japan had been defeated. however, herbert morrison made it clear that the labour party would not be willing to accept this, and churchill was forced to tender his resignation as prime minister and call an immediate election.
the war had set in motion profound social changes within britain, and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for social reform. this mood was epitomised in the beveridge report of 1942, by the liberal economist william beveridge. the "report" assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments, and that this would provide the basis for the welfare state. immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies. all major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim, but most historians say that attlee's labour party were seen by the electorate as the party most likely to follow it through.
labour campaigned on the theme of "let us face the future," positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild britain after the war, and were widely viewed as having run a strong and positive campaign, while the conservative campaign centred entirely around churchill. despite opinion polls indicating a strong labour lead, opinion polls were then viewed as a novelty which had not proven their worth, and most commentators expected that churchill's prestige and status as a "war hero" would ensure a comfortable conservative victory. before polling day, "the manchester guardian" surmised that "the chances of labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority ... are pretty remote". the "news of the world" predicted a working conservative majority, while in glasgow a pundit forecast the result as conservatives 360, labour 220, others 60. churchill however made some costly errors during the campaign. in particular, his suggestion during one radio broadcast that a future labour government would require "some form of a gestapo" to implement their policies was widely regarded as being in very bad taste, and massively backfired.
when the results of the election were announced on 26 july, they came as a surprise to most, including attlee himself. labour had won power by a huge landslide, winning 47.7 per cent of the vote to the conservatives' 36 per cent. this gave them 393 seats in the house of commons, a working majority of 146. this was the first time in history that the labour party had won a majority in parliament. when attlee went to see king george vi at buckingham palace to be appointed prime minister, the notoriously laconic attlee and the famously tongue-tied king stood in silence; attlee finally volunteered the remark, "i've won the election." the king replied "i know. i heard it on the six o'clock news."
as prime minister, attlee appointed hugh dalton as chancellor of the exchequer, ernest bevin as foreign secretary, and herbert morrison as deputy prime minister, with overall responsibility for nationalisation. additionally, stafford cripps was made president of the board of trade, aneurin bevan became minister of health, and ellen wilkinson, the only woman to serve in attlee's government, was appointed minister of education. the attlee government proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. from 1945 to 1948, over 200 public acts of parliament were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone.
francis (1995) argues there was consensus both in the labour's national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. the attlee government was committed to rebuilding british society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary conservative party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality. on 5 july 1948, clement attlee replied to a letter dated 22 june from james murray and ten other mps who raised concerns about west indians who arrived on board the . as for the prime minister himself, he was not much focused on economic policy, letting others handle the issues.
attlee's health minister, aneurin bevan, fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, including the british medical association, by creating the national health service (nhs) in 1948. this was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all at the point of use. reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the nhs treated some 8 and a half million dental patients and dispensed more than 5 million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.
the government set about implementing the wartime plans of liberal william beveridge for the creation of a "cradle to grave" welfare state. it set in place an entirely new system of social security. among the most important pieces of legislation was the national insurance act 1946, in which people in work were required to pay a flat rate of national insurance. in return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for a wide range of benefits, including pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income. in 1949, unemployment, sickness and maternity benefits were exempted from tax.
the new towns act of 1946 set up development corporations to construct new towns, while the town and country planning act of 1947 instructed county councils to prepare development plans and also provided compulsory purchase powers. the attlee government also extended the powers of local authorities to requisition houses and parts of houses, and made the acquisition of land less difficult than before. the housing (scotland) act of 1949 provided grants of 75 per cent (87.5 per cent in the highlands and islands) towards modernisation costs payable by treasury to local authorities.
in 1949, local authorities were empowered to provide people suffering from poor health with public housing at subsidised rents.
to assist home ownership, the limit on the amount of money that people could borrow from their local authority to purchase or build a home was raised from £800 to £1,500 in 1945, and to £5,000 in 1949. under the national assistance act of 1948, local authorities had a duty "to provide emergency temporary accommodation for families which become homeless through no fault of their own."
a large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes. a housing bill passed in 1946 increased treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in england and wales. four out of five houses constructed under labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the second world war, and subsidies kept down council rents. altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest-ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. although the attlee government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.
a number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children. in 1946, universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children. these benefits had been legislated for the previous year by churchill's family allowances act 1945, and was the first measure pushed through parliament by attlee's government. conservatives would later criticise labour for having been "too hasty" in introducing family allowances.
a married women (restraint upon anticipation) act was passed in 1949 "to equalise, to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman," while the married women (maintenance) act of 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women.
the criminal law (amendment) act of 1950 amended an act of 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse. the criminal justice act of 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems, while the passage of the justices of the peace act of 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates' courts. the attlee government also abolished the marriage bar in the civil service, thereby enabling married women to work in that institution.
in 1946, the government set up a national institute of houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service.
by late 1946, agreed standards of training were established, which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine (9) training centres in wales, scotland, and then throughout great britain. the national health service act of 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required "owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged or a child not over compulsory school age." 'home help' therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.
development rights were nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the state. strong planning authorities were set up to control land use, and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land. a chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies.
comprehensive development areas (cdas), a designation under the town and country planning act of 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.
various measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace. entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended, and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative, professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948. worker's compensation was also significantly improved.
the fair wages resolution of 1946 required any contractor working on a public project to at least match the pay rates and other employment conditions set in the appropriate collective agreement. in 1946, purchase tax was removed completely from kitchen fittings and crockery, while the rate was reduced on various gardening items.
the fire services act 1947 introduced a new pension scheme for fire-fighters, while the electricity act 1947 introduced better retirement benefits for workers in that industry. a workers' compensation (supplementation) act was passed in 1948 that introduced benefits for workers with certain asbestos-related diseases which had occurred before 1948. the merchant shipping act of 1948 and the merchant shipping (safety convention) act of 1949 were passed to improve conditions for seamen. the shops act of 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided that no one could be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes. the legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone for worked between 11:30 am and 2:30 pm and a half-hour tea break for anyone working between 4 pm and 7 pm. the government also strengthened a fair wages resolution, with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions.
the trades disputes act 1927 was repealed, and a dock labour scheme was introduced in 1947 to put an end to the casual system of hiring labour in the docks. this scheme gave registered dockers the legal right to minimum work and decent conditions. through the national dock labour board (on which trade unions and employers had equal representation) the unions acquired control over recruitment and dismissal. registered dockers laid off by employers within the scheme had the right either to be taken on by another, or to generous compensation. all dockers were registered under the dock labour scheme, giving them a legal right to minimum work, holidays and sick pay.
wages for members of the police force were significantly increased. the introduction of a miner's charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure, and in 1948 a colliery workers supplementary scheme was approved, providing supplementary allowances to disabled coal-workers and their dependants. in 1948, a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new nhs, as well as their dependents. under the coal industry nationalisation (superannuation) regulations of 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established. improvements were also made in farmworkers' wages, and the agricultural wages board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.
a number of regulations aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of people at work were also introduced during attlee's time in office. regulations issued in february 1946 applied to factories involved with "manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal, coal dust, coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance," and concerned "dust and ventilation, washing facilities and clothing accommodation, medical supervision and examination, skin and eye protection and messrooms."
attlee's government also carried out their manifesto commitment for nationalisation of basic industries and public utilities. the bank of england and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. coal mining, the railways, road haulage, canals and cable and wireless were nationalised in 1947, and electricity and gas followed in 1948. the steel industry was nationalised in 1951. by 1951 about 20 per cent of the british economy had been taken into public ownership.
nationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked. it did, however, bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages, reduced working hours, and improvements in working conditions, especially in regards to safety. as historian eric shaw noted of the years following nationalisation, the electricity and gas supply companies became "impressive models of public enterprise" in terms of efficiency, and the national coal board was not only profitable, but working conditions for miners had significantly improved as well.
within a few years of nationalisation, a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility.
the newly established national coal board offered sick pay and holiday pay to miners. as noted by martin francis:
union leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations. moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.
the attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. in addition, the 1947 transport act improved provision of rural bus services, while the agriculture act 1947 established a more generous subsidy system for farmers. legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent agricultural wages board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.
attlee's government made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90 per cent of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of £15 a year for 40 years towards that cost. grants were also made to meet up to half the cost of supplying water to farm buildings and fields, the government met half the cost of bracken eradication and lime spreading, and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes.
in 1946, the national agricultural advisory service was set up to supply agricultural advice and information. the hill farming act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. the act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. the agricultural holdings act of 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. in addition, the livestock rearing act of march 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 hill farming act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.
at a time of world food shortages, it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities. the government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the national agricultural advisory service provided expertise and price guarantees. as a result of the attlee government's initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20 per cent increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.
the attlee government ensured provisions of the education act 1944 were fully implemented, with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time. fees in state grammar schools were eliminated, while new, modern secondary schools were constructed.
the school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947, an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the h.o.r.s.a. ("huts operation for raising the school-leaving age") scheme and the s.f.o.r.s.a. (furniture) scheme. university scholarships were introduced to ensure that no one who was qualified “should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons,” while a large school building programme was organised. a rapid increase in the number of trained teachers took place, and the number of new school places was increased.
increased treasury funds were made available for education, particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage. prefabricated classrooms were built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950. the provision of free school meals was expanded, and opportunities for university entrants were increased. state scholarships to universities were increased, and the government adopted a policy of supplementing university scholarships awards to a level sufficient to cover fees plus maintenance.
many thousands of ex-servicemen were assisted to go through college who could never have contemplated it before the war. free milk was also made available to all schoolchildren for the first time. in addition, spending on technical education rose, and the number of nursery schools was increased. salaries for teachers were also improved, and funds were allocated towards improving existing schools.
in 1947, the arts council of great britain was set up to encourage the arts.
a ministry of education was established, and free county colleges were set up for the compulsory part-time instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in full-time education. an emergency training scheme was also introduced which turned out an extra 25,000 teachers in 1945–1951. in 1947, regional advisory councils were set up to bring together industry and education to find out the needs of young workers "and advise on the provision required, and to secure reasonable economy of provision." that same year, thirteen area training organisations were set up in england and one in wales to coordinate teacher training.
attlee's government, however, failed to introduce the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped. this reform was eventually carried out by harold wilson's government. during its time in office, the attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from £6.5 billion to £10 billion.
the most significant problem facing attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the war effort had left britain nearly bankrupt. the war had cost britain about a quarter of her national wealth. overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. the transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade. this resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the pound sterling so that britain could trade its way out of its financial state.
the abrupt end of the american lend-lease program in august 1945 almost caused a crisis. some relief was provided by the anglo-american loan, negotiated in december 1945. the conditions attached to the loan included making the pound fully convertible to the us dollar. when this was introduced in july 1947, it led to a currency crisis and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks. the uk benefited from the american marshall aid program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced chancellor of the exchequer, stafford cripps, into devaluation of the pound.
despite these problems, one of the main achievements of attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. the government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce. labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. the inflation rate was also kept low during his term. the rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during attlee's time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened.
the government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of aneurin bevan. the government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the attlee government's housing policies. between august 1945 and december 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in england, scotland, and wales.
when the attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. the period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. during that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the uk had "the best economic performance in europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the united states." careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels. in addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3 million to 5 million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before. a monopolies and restrictive practices (inquiry and control) act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.
1947 proved a particularly difficult year for the government; an exceptionally cold winter that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread power cuts and food shortages. the minister of fuel and power, emanuel shinwell was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. the conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan 'starve with strachey and shiver with shinwell' (referring to the minister of food john strachey).
the crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by hugh dalton to replace attlee as prime minister with ernest bevin. later that year stafford cripps tried to persuade attlee to stand aside for bevin. these plots petered out after bevin refused to cooperate. later that year, hugh dalton resigned as chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. he was replaced by cripps.
in foreign affairs, the attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war europe, the onset of the cold war, the establishment of the united nations, and decolonisation. the first two were closely related, and attlee was assisted by foreign secretary ernest bevin. attlee also attended the later stages of the potsdam conference, where he negotiated with president harry s. truman and joseph stalin.
in the immediate aftermath of the war, the government faced the challenge of managing relations with britain's former war-time ally, stalin and the soviet union. ernest bevin was a passionate anti-communist, based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. bevin's initial approach to the ussr as foreign secretary was "wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile." attlee himself sought warm relations with stalin. he put his trust in the united nations, rejected notions that the soviet union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. this put attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the foreign office, and the military who all saw the soviets as a growing threat to britain's role in the middle east. suddenly in january 1947, attlee reversed his position and agreed with bevin on a hard-line anti-soviet policy.
in an early "good-will" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the attlee government allowed the soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 uk-ussr trade agreement, a total of 25 rolls-royce nene jet engines in september 1947 and march 1948. the agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. the price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the ussr in 1947. however, the cold war intensified during this period and the soviets, who at the time were well behind the west in jet technology, reverse-engineered the nene and installed their own version in the mig-15 interceptor. this was used to good effect against us-uk forces in the subsequent korean war, as well as in several later mig models.
after stalin took political control of most of eastern europe, and began to subvert other governments in the balkans, attlee's and bevin's worst fears of soviet intentions were realised. the attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful nato defence alliance to protect western europe against any soviet expansion. in a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war europe, attlee's cabinet was instrumental in promoting the american marshall plan for the economic recovery of europe. he called it, one of the "most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations."
a group of labour mps, organised under the banner of "keep left" urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a "third force" of european powers to stand between the us and ussr. however, deteriorating relations between britain and the ussr, as well as britain's economic reliance on america following the marshall plan, steered policy towards supporting the us. in january 1947, fear of both soviet and american nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of britain's independent nuclear deterrent, an issue which later caused a split in the labour party. britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after attlee had left office.
the london dock strike of july 1949, led by communists, was suppressed when the attlee government sent in 13,000 army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. his response reveals attlee's growing concern that soviet expansionism, supported by the british communist party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by moscow. he noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in canada. attlee agreed with mi5 that he faced "a very present menace."
decolonisation was never a major election issue but attlee gave the matter a great deal of attention and was the chief leader in planning and achieving the process of decolonisation of the british empire, starting in asia.
attlee orchestrated the granting of independence to india and pakistan in 1947. attlee in 1928–1934 had been a member of the indian statutory commission, called the simon commission. he became the labour party expert on india and by 1934 was committed to granting india the same independent dominion status that canada and australia recently were given. he faced strong resistance from the die-hard conservative imperialists, led by churchill, who opposed both independence and efforts led by prime minister stanley baldwin to set up a system of limited local control by indians themselves. attlee and the labour leadership were sympathetic to the congress movement led by mahatma gandhi and jawaharlal nehru. during the second world war attlee was in charge of indian affairs. he set up the cripps mission in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together. when the congress called for passive resistance in the "quit india" movement of 1942–1945, it was attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of congress leaders and crushed the revolt.
labour's election manifesto in 1945 called for "the advancement of india to responsible self-government," but did not mention independence. in 1942 the british raj tried to enlist all major political factors parties in support of the war effort. congress, led by nehru and gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by congress of all of india. that demand was rejected by the british, and congress opposed the war effort with its "quit india campaign". the raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local congress leaders for the duration. attlee did not object. by contrast, the muslim league led by muhammad ali jinnah, and also the sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. they greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from london for their decision. attlee retained a fondness for congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted hindus, muslims, sikhs, and everyone else.
the muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the muslims of india, and by 1946 attlee had come to agree with them.
with violence escalating in india after the war, but with british financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. viceroy wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. no divisions were available; independence was the only option. given the demands of the muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily muslim pakistan from the main portion of india.
the labour government gave independence to india and pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. historian andrew roberts says the independence of india was a "national humiliation" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. churchill in 1940–1945 had tightened the hold on india and imprisoned the congress leadership, with attlee's approval. labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like canada or australia. many of the congress leaders in the india had studied in england, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by labour leaders. attlee was the labour expert on india and took special charge of decolonisation. attlee found that churchill's viceroy, field marshal wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more army divisions) and too neglectful of indian political alignments. the new viceroy was lord mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of the king. the boundary between the newly created states of pakistan and india involved the widespread resettlement of millions of muslims and hindus (and many sikhs). extreme violence ensued when punjab and bengal provinces were split. historian yasmin khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. gandhi himself was assassinated by a hindu activist in january 1948.
the final result was two nations consisting of a hindu-majority india and a muslim-majority pakistan (which incorporated east pakistan, now bangladesh). both joined the commonwealth.
attlee also sponsored the peaceful transition to independence in 1948 of burma (myanmar) and ceylon (sri lanka).
one of the most urgent problems concerned the future of the palestine mandate. it had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle. british policies there were perceived by the zionist movement and the truman administration as pro-arab and anti-jewish. in the face of an armed revolt of jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local arab population, britain had found itself unable to control events. this was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of british troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to the united nations was widely supported by the british public.
the government's policies with regard to the other colonies, particularly those in africa, focused on keeping them as strategic cold war assets while modernising their economies. the labour party had long attracted aspiring leaders from africa and had developed elaborate plans before the war. implementing them overnight with an empty treasury proved too challenging. a major military base was built in kenya, and the african colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from london. development schemes were implemented to help solve britain's post-war balance of payments crisis and raise african living standards. this "new colonialism" worked slowly and had failures such as the tanganyika groundnut scheme.
the 1950 election gave labour a massively reduced majority of five seats compared to the triple-digit majority of 1945. although re-elected, the result was seen by attlee as very disappointing, and was widely attributed to the effects of post-war austerity denting labour's appeal to middle-class voters. with such a small majority leaving him dependent on a small number of mps to govern, attlee's second term was much tamer than his first. some major reforms were nevertheless passed, particularly regarding industry in urban areas and regulations to limit air and water pollution.
by 1951, the attlee government was exhausted, with several of its most senior ministers ailing or ageing, and with a lack of new ideas. attlee's record for settling internal differences in the labour party fell in april 1951, when there was a damaging split over an austerity budget brought in by the chancellor, hugh gaitskell, to pay for the cost of britain's participation in the korean war. aneurin bevan resigned to protest against the new charges for "teeth and spectacles" in the national health service introduced by that budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future prime minister harold wilson, then the president of the board of trade. thus escalated a battle between the left and right wings of the party that continues today.
finding it increasingly impossible to govern, attlee's only chance was to call a snap election in october 1951, in the hope of achieving a more workable majority and to regain authority. the gamble failed: labour narrowly lost to the conservative party, despite winning considerably more votes (achieving the largest labour vote in electoral history). attlee tendered his resignation as prime minister the following day, after six years and three months in office.
following the defeat in 1951, attlee continued to lead the party as leader of the opposition. his last four years as leader were, however, widely seen as one of the labour party's weaker periods.
the period was dominated by infighting between the labour party's right wing, led by hugh gaitskell, and its left, led by aneurin bevan. many labour mps felt that attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954. one of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of herbert morrison, whom attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. at one time, attlee had favoured aneurin bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after bevan almost irrevocably split the party.
in an interview with the "news chronicle" columnist percy cudlipp in mid-september 1955, attlee made clear his own thinking together with his preference for the leadership succession, stating:
attlee, now aged 72, contested the 1955 general election against anthony eden, which saw labour lose 18 seats, and the conservatives increase their majority. he retired as leader of the labour party on 7 december 1955, having led the party for twenty years, and on 14 december hugh gaitskell was elected as his replacement.
he subsequently retired from the house of commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the house of lords as earl attlee and viscount prestwood on 16 december 1955. he believed eden had been forced into taking a strong stand on the suez crisis by his backbenchers. in 1958, he was, along with numerous notables, to establish the homosexual law reform society. the society campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through parliament nine years later.
in 1962, he spoke twice in the house of lords against the british government's application for the uk to join the european economic community ("common market"). in his second speech delivered in november, attlee claimed that britain had a separate parliamentary tradition from the continental countries that composed the eec. he also claimed that if britain was a member, eec rules would prevent the british government from planning the economy and that britain's traditional policy had been outward looking rather than continental.
he attended winston churchill's funeral in january 1965. he was elderly and frail by that time, and had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day. he lived to see the labour party return to power under harold wilson in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of walthamstow west fall to the conservatives in a by-election in september 1967.
attlee died peacefully in his sleep of pneumonia, at the age of 84 at westminster hospital on 8 october 1967. two thousand people attended his funeral in november, including the then-prime minister harold wilson and the duke of kent, representing the queen. he was cremated and his ashes were buried at westminster abbey.
upon his death, the title passed to his son martin richard attlee, 2nd earl attlee (1927–1991). it is now held by clement attlee's grandson john richard attlee, 3rd earl attlee. the third earl (a member of the conservative party) retained his seat in the lords as one of the hereditary peers to remain under an amendment to labour's 1999 house of lords act.
attlee's estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of £7,295, a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure, and only a fraction of the £75,394 in his father's estate when he died in 1908.
the quotation about attlee, "a modest man, but then he has so much to be modest about", is commonly ascribed to churchill—though churchill denied saying it, and respected attlee's service in the war cabinet. attlee's modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. in terms of the machinery of government, he was one of the most businesslike and effective of all the uk prime ministers. the journalist and broadcaster anthony howard called him "the greatest prime minister of the 20th century."
his leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. christopher soames, the british ambassador to france during the conservative government of edward heath and cabinet minister under margaret thatcher, remarked that "mrs thatcher was not really running a team. every time you have a prime minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. attlee didn't. that's why he was so damn good."
thatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in grantham to her victory at the 1979 general election, that she admired attlee, writing: "of clement attlee, however, i was an admirer. he was a serious man and a patriot. quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show."
attlee's government presided over the successful transition from a wartime economy to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of foreign currency, and adverse deficits in trade balances and government expenditure. further domestic policies that he brought about included the creation of the national health service and the post-war welfare state, which became key to the reconstruction of post-war britain. attlee and his ministers did much to transform the uk into a more prosperous and egalitarian society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population.
in foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of europe. he proved a loyal ally of the united states at the onset of the cold war. due to his style of leadership, it was not he, but ernest bevin who masterminded foreign policy. it was attlee's government that decided britain should have an independent nuclear weapons programme, and work on it began in 1947.
bevin, attlee's foreign secretary, famously stated that "we've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody union jack on it." the first operational british a bomb was not detonated until october 1952, about one year after attlee had left office. independent british atomic research was prompted partly by the us mcmahon act, which nullified wartime expectations of postwar us–uk collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. british atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of attlee's own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain.
although a socialist, attlee still believed in the british empire of his youth. he thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. using the dominions of canada, australia, and new zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the empire into the modern-day british commonwealth.
his greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was perhaps the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of britain that all three major parties subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the late-1970s. in 2004, he was voted the most successful british prime minister of the 20th century by a poll of 139 academics organised by ipsos mori.
several years after his death, a street on a new housing development in tividale, west midlands, was named attlee close in his memory. the birks holt social housing estate in maltby, south yorkshire, has its streets named after labour politicians, including attlee, sir stafford cripps, hugh gaitskell, and george lansbury.
a blue plaque unveiled in 1979 commemorates attlee at 17 monkhams avenue, in woodford green in the london borough of redbridge.
attlee was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1947. attlee was awarded an honorary fellowship of queen mary college on 15 december 1948.
on 30 november 1988, a bronze statue of clement attlee was unveiled by harold wilson (the next labour prime minister after attlee) outside limehouse library in attlee's former constituency. by then wilson was the last surviving member of attlee's cabinet, and the unveiling of the statue would be one of the last public appearances by wilson, who was by that point in the early stages of alzheimer's disease; he died at the age of 79 in may 1995.
limehouse library was closed in 2003, after which the statue was vandalised. the council surrounded it with protective hoarding for four years, before eventually removing it for repair and recasting in 2009. in april 2011 the restored statue was unveiled by peter mandelson in its new position less than a mile away at the queen mary university of london's mile end campus.
there is also a statue of clement attlee in the houses of parliament that was erected, instead of a bust, by parliamentary vote in 1979. the sculptor was ivor roberts-jones.
although one of his brothers became a clergyman and one of his sisters a missionary, attlee himself is usually regarded as an agnostic. in an interview he described himself as "incapable of religious feeling", saying that he believed in "the ethics of christianity" but not "the mumbo-jumbo." when asked whether he was an agnostic, attlee replied "i don't know."

gaius valerius catullus (; ; c. 84 – c. 54 bce) was a latin poet of the late roman republic who wrote chiefly in the neoteric style of poetry, which is about personal life rather than classical heroes. his surviving works are still read widely and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art.
catullus's poems were widely appreciated by other poets, significantly influencing ovid and virgil, among others. after his rediscovery in the late middle ages, catullus again found admirers. the explicit sexual imagery which he uses in some of his poems has shocked many readers. indeed, catullus's work was never canonical in schools, although his body of work is still frequently read from secondary school to graduate programs across the world, with his 64th poem often considered his greatest.
gaius valerius catullus () was born to a leading equestrian family of verona, in cisalpine gaul. the social prominence of the catullus family allowed the father of gaius valerius to entertain julius caesar when he was the promagistrate (proconsul) of both gallic provinces. in a poem, catullus describes his happy homecoming to the family villa at sirmio, on lake garda, near verona; he also owned a villa near the resort of tibur (tivoli).
catullus appears to have spent most of his young adult years in rome. his friends there included the poets licinius calvus, and helvius cinna, quintus hortensius (son of the orator and rival of cicero) and the biographer cornelius nepos, to whom catullus dedicated a "libellus" of poems, the relation of which to the extant collection remains a matter of debate. he appears to have been acquainted with the poet marcus furius bibaculus. a number of prominent contemporaries appear in his poetry, including cicero, caesar and pompey. according to an anecdote preserved by suetonius, caesar did not deny that catullus's lampoons left an indelible stain on his reputation, but when catullus apologized, he invited the poet for dinner the very same day.
it was probably in rome that catullus fell deeply in love with the "lesbia" of his poems, who is usually identified with clodia metelli, a sophisticated woman from the aristocratic house of patrician family claudii pulchri, sister of the infamous publius clodius pulcher, and wife to proconsul quintus caecilius metellus celer. in his poems catullus describes several stages of their relationship: initial euphoria, doubts, separation, and his wrenching feelings of loss. clodia had several other partners; "from the poems one can adduce no fewer than five lovers in addition to catullus: egnatius (poem 37), gellius (poem 91), quintius (poem 82), rufus (poem 77), and lesbius (poem 79)." there is also some question surrounding her husband's mysterious death in 59 b.c., some critics believing he was domestically poisoned. yet, a sensitive and passionate catullus could not relinquish his flame for clodia, regardless of her obvious indifference to his desire for a deep and permanent relationship. in his poems, catullus wavers between devout, sweltering love and bitter, scornful insults that he directs at her blatant infidelity (as demonstrated in poems 11 and 58). his passion for her is unrelenting—yet it is unclear when exactly the couple split up for good. catullus's poems about the relationship display striking depth and psychological insight.
he spent the provincial command year summer 57 to summer 56 bce in bithynia on the staff of the commander gaius memmius. while in the east, he traveled to the troad to perform rites at his brother's tomb, an event recorded in a moving poem.
there survives no ancient biography of catullus: his life has to be pieced together from scattered references to him in other ancient authors and from his poems. thus it is uncertain when he was born and when he died. st. jerome says that he died in his 30th year, and was born in 87 bce. but the poems include references to events of 55 and 54 bce. since the roman consular fasti make it somewhat easy to confuse 87–57 bce with 84–54 bce, many scholars accept the dates 84 bce–54 bce, supposing that his latest poems and the publication of his "libellus" coincided with the year of his death. other authors suggest 52 or 51 bce as the year of the poet's death. though upon his elder brother's death catullus lamented that their "whole house was buried along" with the deceased, the existence (and prominence) of "valerii catulli" is attested in the following centuries. t.p. wiseman argues that after the brother's death catullus could have married, and that, in this case, the later "valerii catulli" may have been his descendants.
catullus's poems have been preserved in an anthology of 116 "carmina" (the actual number of poems may slightly vary in various editions), which can be divided into three parts according to their form: sixty short poems in varying meters, called "polymetra", eight longer poems, and forty-eight epigrams.
there is no scholarly consensus on whether catullus himself arranged the order of the poems. the longer poems differ from the "polymetra" and the epigrams not only in length but also in their subjects: there are seven hymns and one mini-epic, or epyllion, the most highly prized form for the "new poets".
the "polymetra" and the epigrams can be divided into four major thematic groups (ignoring a rather large number of poems that elude such categorization):
all these poems describe the lifestyle of catullus and his friends, who, despite catullus's temporary political post in bithynia, lived their lives withdrawn from politics. they were interested mainly in poetry and love. above all other qualities, catullus seems to have valued "venustas", or charm, in his acquaintances, a theme which he explores in a number of his poems. the ancient roman concept of "virtus" (i.e. of virtue that had to be proved by a political or military career), which cicero suggested as the solution to the societal problems of the late republic, meant little to them.
however catullus does not reject traditional notions, but rather their particular application to the "vita activa" of politics and war. indeed, he tries to reinvent these notions from a personal point of view and to introduce them into human relationships. for example, he applies the word "fides", which traditionally meant faithfulness towards one's political allies, to his relationship with lesbia and reinterprets it as unconditional faithfulness in love. so, despite the seeming frivolity of his lifestyle, catullus measured himself and his friends by quite ambitious standards.
catullus's poetry was influenced by the innovative poetry of the hellenistic age, and especially by callimachus and the alexandrian school, which had propagated a new style of poetry that deliberately turned away from the classical epic poetry in the tradition of homer. cicero called these local innovators "neoteroi" (νεώτεροι) or 'moderns' (in latin "poetae novi" or 'new poets'), in that they cast off the heroic model handed down from ennius in order to strike new ground and ring a contemporary note. catullus and callimachus did not describe the feats of ancient heroes and gods (except perhaps in re-evaluating and predominantly artistic circumstances, e.g. poems 63 and 64), focusing instead on small-scale personal themes. although these poems sometimes seem quite superficial and their subjects often are mere everyday concerns, they are accomplished works of art. catullus described his work as "expolitum", or polished, to show that the language he used was very carefully and artistically composed.
catullus was also an admirer of sappho, a female poet of the seventh century bce. catullus 51 is partly translates, partly imitates and transforms sappho 31. some hypothesize that 61 and 62 were perhaps inspired bylost works of sappho but this is purely speculative. both of the latter are "epithalamia", a form of laudatory or erotic wedding-poetry that sappho was famous for. catullus twice used a meter that sappho developed, called the sapphic strophe, in poems 11 and 51, perhaps prompting his successor horace's interest in the form.
catullus, as was common to his era, was greatly influenced by stories from greek and roman myth. his longer poems—such as 63, 64, 65, 66, and 68—allude to mythology in various ways. some stories he refers to are the wedding of peleus and thetis, the departure of the argonauts, theseus and the minotaur, ariadne's abandonment, tereus and procne, as well as protesilaus and laodamia.
catullus wrote in many different meters including hendecasyllabic verse and elegiac couplets (common in love poetry). a great part of his poetry shows strong and occasionally wild emotions, especially in regard to lesbia. his love poems are very emotional and ardent, and can be related to even today. catullus describes his lesbia as having multiple suitors and often showing little affection towards him. he also demonstrates a great sense of humour such as in catullus 13.

cecil louis troughton smith (27 august 1899 – 2 april 1966), known by his pen name cecil scott "c. s." forester, was an english novelist known for writing tales of naval warfare, such as the 12-book horatio hornblower series depicting a royal navy officer during the napoleonic wars. the hornblower novels "a ship of the line" and "flying colours" were jointly awarded the james tait black memorial prize for fiction in 1938. his other works include "the african queen" (1935, filmed in 1951 by john huston).
forester was born in cairo and, after a family breakup at an early age, moved with his mother to london where he was educated at alleyn's school and dulwich college. he began to study medicine at guy's hospital but left without completing his degree. forester wore glasses and was of slender physique; he failed his army physical and was told that there was no chance that he would be accepted, even though he was of good height and somewhat athletic. he began writing seriously around 1921 using his pen name.
forester moved to the united states during the second world war, where he worked for the british ministry of information and wrote propaganda to encourage the us to join the allies. he eventually settled in berkeley, california. he met roald dahl in 1942 while living in washington, d.c., and forester encouraged him to write about his experiences in the raf. according to dahl's autobiography "lucky break", forester asked him about his experiences as a fighter pilot, and this prompted dahl to write his first story "a piece of cake".
forester wrote many novels, but he is best known for the 12-book horatio hornblower series depicting a royal navy officer during the napoleonic wars. he began the series with hornblower fairly high in rank in the first novel that he wrote, which was published in 1937. but high demand for more stories led him to fill in hornblower's life story, and he wrote novels detailing his rise from the rank of midshipman. the last completed novel was published in 1962. hornblower's fictional feats were based on real events, but forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history, so that hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval battle occurs during the napoleonic wars.
forester's other novels include "the african queen" (1935) and "the general" (1936); peninsular war novels in "death to the french" (published in the united states as "rifleman dodd") and "the gun" (filmed as "the pride and the passion" in 1957); and seafaring stories that did not involve hornblower, such as "brown on resolution" (1929), "the captain from connecticut" (1941), "the ship" (1943), and "hunting the bismarck" (1959), which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the film "sink the bismarck!" (1960). several of his works were filmed, including "the african queen" (1951), directed by john huston. forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including "commandos strike at dawn" (1942).
he wrote several volumes of short stories set during the second world war. those in "the nightmare" (1954) were based on events in nazi germany, ending at the nuremberg trials. stories in "the man in the yellow raft" (1969) followed the career of the destroyer uss "boon", while many of those in "gold from crete" (1971) followed the destroyer hms "apache". the last of the stories in "gold from crete" was "if hitler had invaded england", which offers an imagined sequence of events starting with hitler's attempt to implement operation sea lion, and culminating in the early military defeat of nazi germany in the summer of 1941. his non-fiction seafaring works include "the age of fighting sail" (1956), an account of the sea battles between great britain and the united states in the war of 1812.
forester also published the crime novels "payment deferred" (1926) and "plain murder" (1930), as well as two children's books. "poo-poo and the dragons" (1942) was created as a series of stories told to his son george to encourage him to finish his meals. george had mild food allergies which kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat. "the barbary pirates" (1953) is a children's history of early 19th-century pirates.
forester appeared as a contestant on the television quiz program "you bet your life" hosted by groucho marx, in an episode broadcast on 1 november 1956. a previously unknown novel of forester's entitled "the pursued" was discovered in 2003 and published by penguin classics on 3 november 2011.
he married kathleen belcher in 1926 and they had two sons, john and george forester. the couple divorced in 1945. in 1947, he married dorothy foster.
john forester wrote a two-volume biography of his father, including many elements of forester's life which only became clear to his son after his death.

country calling codes or country dial-in codes are telephone number prefixes for reaching telephone subscribers in the networks of the member countries or regions of the international telecommunication union (itu). the codes are defined by the itu-t in standards e.123 and e.164. the prefixes enable international direct dialing (idd), and are also referred to as "international subscriber dialing" (isd) codes.
country codes are a component of the international telephone numbering plan, and are necessary only when dialing a telephone number to establish a call to another country. country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. by convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local international call prefix must first be dialed. for example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the north american numbering plan is 011, while it is 00 in most european, asian and african countries. on gsm (cellular) networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.
country calling codes are prefix codes and can be organized as a tree. in each row of the table, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.
while there is a general geographic grouping to the zones, some exceptions exist for political and historical reasons. thus, the geographical indicators below are approximations only.
member countries of the north american numbering plan (nanp) are assigned three-digit area codes under the common country prefix "1", shown in the format "+1 xxx".
the north american numbering plan includes:
originally, larger countries such as spain, the united kingdom and france, were assigned two-digit codes to compensate for their usually longer domestic numbers. small countries, such as iceland, were assigned three-digit codes. since the 1980s, all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ populations.
in antarctica, dialing is dependent on the parent country of each base:

christopher marlowe, also known as kit marlowe (; baptised 26 february 156430 may 1593), was an english playwright, poet and translator of the elizabethan era. marlowe was the foremost elizabethan tragedian of his day. he greatly influenced william shakespeare, who was born in the same year as marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent elizabethan playwright after marlowe's mysterious early death. marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists.
some scholars believe that a warrant was issued for marlowe's arrest on 18 may 1593. no reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by marlowe was said to contain "vile heretical conceipts". on 20 may, he was brought to the court to attend upon the privy council for questioning. there is no record of their having met that day and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until "licensed to the contrary". ten days later, he was stabbed to death by ingram frizer. whether or not the stabbing was connected to his arrest remains unknown.
marlowe was born in canterbury to shoemaker john marlowe and his wife catherine. his date of birth is not known but he was baptised on 26 february 1564 and is likely to have been born a few days before, making him two months older than william shakespeare, who was baptised on 26 april 1564 in stratford-upon-avon.
marlowe attended the king's school in canterbury (where a house is named after him) and corpus christi college, cambridge, where he studied on a scholarship and received his bachelor of arts degree in 1584. in 1587, the university hesitated to award him his master of arts degree because of a rumour that he intended to go to the english college at rheims, presumably to prepare for ordination as a roman catholic priest. his degree was awarded on schedule when the privy council intervened on his behalf, commending him for his "faithful dealing" and "good service" to the queen. the nature of marlowe's service was not specified by the council but its letter to the cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation, notably the theory that marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for sir francis walsingham. no direct evidence supports this theory, although the council's letter is evidence that marlowe had served the government in some secret capacity.
of the dramas attributed to marlowe, "dido, queen of carthage" is believed to have been his first. it was performed by the children of the chapel, a company of boy actors, between 1587 and 1593. the play was first published in 1594; the title page attributes the play to marlowe and thomas nashe.
marlowe's first play performed on the regular stage in london, in 1587, was "tamburlaine the great", about the conqueror timur (tamerlane), who rises from shepherd to warlord. it is among the first english plays in blank verse and with thomas kyd's "the spanish tragedy", generally is considered the beginning of the mature phase of the elizabethan theatre. "tamburlaine" was a success and was followed with "tamburlaine the great, part ii".
the two parts of "tamburlaine" were published in 1590; all marlowe's other works were published posthumously. the sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown; all deal with controversial themes.
marlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of edward alleyn. alleyn was unusually tall for the time and the haughty roles of tamburlaine, faustus and barabas were probably written for him. marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of alleyn's company, the admiral's men, throughout the 1590s. marlowe also wrote the poem "hero and leander" (published in 1598 and with a continuation by george chapman the same year), the popular lyric "the passionate shepherd to his love", translations of ovid's "amores" and the first book of lucan's "pharsalia". in 1599, his translation of ovid was banned and copies publicly burned as part of archbishop whitgift's crackdown on offensive material. marlowe has been credited in the new oxford shakespeare series as co-author of the three "henry vi" plays, though some scholars doubt any actual collaboration.
as with other writers of the period, little is known about marlowe. what evidence there is can be found in legal records and other official documents. this has not stopped writers of fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his activities and character. marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler and a heretic, as well as a "magician", "duellist", "tobacco-user", "counterfeiter" and "rakehell". j. a. downie and constance kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculation but j. b. steane remarked, "it seems absurd to dismiss all of these elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the marlowe myth.
marlowe is alleged to have been a government spy (park honan's 2005 biography of marlowe was even subtitled "poet and spy"). the author charles nicholl speculates this was the case and suggests that marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at cambridge. as noted above, in 1587 the privy council ordered the university of cambridge to award marlowe his degree of master of arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the english catholic college in rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified "affaires" on "matters touching the benefit of his country". surviving college records from the period also indicate that marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university (much longer than permitted by university regulations) that began in the academic year 1584–1585. surviving college buttery (provisions store) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance, more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.
it has been speculated that marlowe was the "morley" who was tutor to arbella stuart in 1589. this possibility was first raised in a "times literary supplement" ("tls") letter by e. st john brooks in 1937; in a letter to "notes and queries", john baker has added that only marlowe could be arbella's tutor due to the absence of any other known "morley" from the period with an ma and not otherwise occupied. if marlowe was arbella's tutor (and some biographers think that the "morley" in question may have been a brother of the musician thomas morley), it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since arbella, niece of mary, queen of scots, and cousin of james vi of scotland, later james i of england, was at the time a strong candidate for the succession to elizabeth's throne. frederick s. boas dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document his "residence in london between september and december 1589". marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet thomas watson in norton folgate and was held in newgate prison for a fortnight. in fact, the quarrel and his arrest was on 18 september, he was released on bail on 1 october and he had to attend court, where he was acquitted on 3 december but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months.
in 1592 marlowe was arrested in the town of flushing (vlissingen) (then an english garrison town) in the netherlands, for his alleged involvement in the counterfeiting of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious catholics. he was sent to be dealt with by the lord treasurer (burghley) but no charge or imprisonment resulted. this arrest may have disrupted another of marlowe's spying missions, perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the catholic cause. he was to infiltrate the followers of the active catholic plotter william stanley and report back to burghley.
in early may 1593, several bills were posted about london threatening protestant refugees from france and the netherlands who had settled in the city. one of these, the "dutch church libel", written in rhymed iambic pentameter, contained allusions to several of marlowe's plays and was signed, "tamburlaine". on 11 may the privy council ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. the next day, marlowe's colleague thomas kyd was arrested, his lodgings were searched and a three-page fragment of a heretical tract was found. in a letter to sir john puckering, kyd asserted that it had belonged to marlowe, with whom he had been writing "in one chamber" some two years earlier. in a second letter, kyd described marlowe as blasphemous, disorderly, holding treasonous opinions, being an irreligious reprobate and "intemperate & of a cruel hart". they had both been working for an aristocratic patron, probably ferdinando stanley, lord strange. a warrant for marlowe's arrest was issued on 18 may, when the privy council apparently knew that he might be found staying with thomas walsingham, whose father was a first cousin of the late sir francis walsingham, elizabeth's principal secretary in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the privy council. marlowe duly presented himself on 20 may but there apparently being no privy council meeting on that day, was instructed to "give his daily attendance on their lordships, until he shall be licensed to the contrary". on wednesday, 30 may, marlowe was killed.
various accounts of marlowe's death were current over the next few years. in his "palladis tamia", published in 1598, francis meres says marlowe was "stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love" as punishment for his "epicurism and atheism". in 1917, in the "dictionary of national biography", sir sidney lee wrote that marlowe was killed in a drunken fight and this is still often stated as fact today. the official account came to light only in 1925, when the scholar leslie hotson discovered the coroner's report of the inquest on marlowe's death, held two days later on friday 1 june 1593, by the coroner of the queen's household, william danby. marlowe had spent all day in a house in deptford, owned by the widow eleanor bull and together with three men: ingram frizer, nicholas skeres and robert poley. all three had been employed by one or other of the walsinghams. skeres and poley had helped snare the conspirators in the babington plot and frizer would later describe thomas walsingham as his "master" at that time, although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent, as he was for walsingham's wife audrey a few years later. these witnesses testified that frizer and marlowe had argued over payment of the bill (now famously known as the 'reckoning') exchanging "divers malicious words" while frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. marlowe snatched frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. in the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. the jury concluded that frizer acted in self-defence and within a month he was pardoned. marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of st. nicholas, deptford immediately after the inquest, on 1 june 1593.
the complete text of the inquest report was published by leslie hotson in his book, "the death of christopher marlowe", in the introduction to which prof. george kittredge said "the mystery of marlowe's death, heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work, is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness" but this confidence proved fairly short-lived. hotson had considered the possibility that the witnesses had "concocted a lying account of marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury" but came down against that scenario. others began to suspect that this was indeed the case. writing to the "tls" shortly after the book's publication, eugénie de kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible and samuel a. tannenbaum insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death, as had been claimed. even marlowe's biographer john bakeless acknowledged that "some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroner's report. there is something queer about the whole episode" and said that hotson's discovery "raises almost as many questions as it answers". it has also been discovered more recently that the apparent absence of a local county coroner to accompany the coroner of the queen's household would, if noticed, have made the inquest null and void.
one of the main reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest concerns the reliability of marlowe's companions as witnesses. as an "agent provocateur" for the late sir francis walsingham, robert poley was a consummate liar, the "very genius of the elizabethan underworld" and is on record as saying "i will swear and forswear myself, rather than i will accuse myself to do me any harm". the other witness, nicholas skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including marlowe's apparent killer, ingram frizer, with whom he was engaged in such a swindle. despite their being referred to as "generosi" (gentlemen) in the inquest report, the witnesses were professional liars. some biographers, such as kuriyama and downie, take the inquest to be a true account of what occurred but in trying to explain what really happened if the account was "not" true, others have come up with a variety of murder theories.
since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to paper, it is unlikely that the full circumstances of marlowe's death will ever be known.
marlowe was reputed to be an atheist, which held the dangerous implication of being an enemy of god and the state, by association. with the rise of public fears concerning the school of night, or "school of atheism" in the late 16th century, accusations of atheism were closely associated with disloyalty to the protestant monarchy of england.
some modern historians consider that marlowe's professed atheism, as with his supposed catholicism, may have been no more than a sham to further his work as a government spy. contemporary evidence comes from marlowe's accuser in flushing, an informer called richard baines. the governor of flushing had reported that each of the men had "of malice" accused the other of instigating the counterfeiting and of intending to go over to the catholic "enemy"; such an action was considered atheistic by the church of england. following marlowe's arrest in 1593, baines submitted to the authorities a "note containing the opinion of one christopher marly concerning his damnable judgment of religion, and scorn of god's word". baines attributes to marlowe a total of eighteen items which "scoff at the pretensions of the old and new testament" such as, "christ was a bastard and his mother dishonest [unchaste]", "the woman of samaria and her sister were whores and that christ knew them dishonestly", "st john the evangelist was bedfellow to christ and leaned always in his bosom" (cf. john 13:23–25) and "that he used him as the sinners of sodom". he also implied that marlowe had catholic sympathies. other passages are merely sceptical in tone: "he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins". the final paragraph of baines's document reads:
similar examples of marlowe's statements were given by thomas kyd after his imprisonment and possible torture (see above); kyd and baines connect marlowe with the mathematician thomas harriot and sir walter raleigh's circle. another document claimed around that time that "one marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for atheism than any divine in england is able to give to prove divinity, and that ... he hath read the atheist lecture to sir walter raleigh and others".
some critics believe that marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists. plays had to be approved by the master of the revels before they could be performed and the censorship of publications was under the control of the archbishop of canterbury. presumably these authorities did not consider any of marlowe's works to be unacceptable other than the "amores".
marlowe is frequently claimed to have been homosexual. others argue that the question of whether an elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. for the elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity. some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of marlowe's homosexuality may be rumours produced after his death. richard baines reported marlowe as saying: "all they that love not tobacco & boies were fools". david bevington and eric rasmussen describe baines's evidence as "unreliable testimony" and "these and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt".
j.b. steane, remarked that he considered there to be "no "evidence" for marlowe's homosexuality at all". other scholars point to homosexual themes in marlowe's writing: in "hero and leander", marlowe writes of the male youth leander, "in his looks were all that men desire" and that when the youth swims to visit hero at sestos, the sea god neptune becomes sexually excited, "[i]magining that ganymede, displeas'd, [h]ad left the heavens ... [t]he lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... he watched his arms and, as they opened wide [a]t every stroke, betwixt them would he slide [a]nd steal a kiss, ... and dive into the water, and there pry [u]pon his breast, his thighs, and every limb, ... [a]nd talk of love", while the boy, naive and unaware of greek love practices, protests, you are deceiv'd, i am no woman, i.' thereat smil'd neptune.". "edward the second" contains the following passage supporting homosexual relationships:
marlowe wrote the only play about the life of edward ii up to his time, taking the humanist literary discussion of male sexuality much further than his contemporaries. the play was extremely bold, dealing with a star-crossed love story between edward ii and piers gaveston. though it was common practice at the time to reveal characters as gay to give audiences reason to suspect them as culprits in a crime, christopher marlowe's edward ii is portrayed as a sympathetic character.
for his contemporaries in the literary world, marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. within weeks of his death, george peele remembered him as "marley, the muses' darling"; michael drayton noted that he "had in him those brave translunary things / that the first poets had" and ben jonson wrote of "marlowe's mighty line". thomas nashe wrote warmly of his friend, "poor deceased kit marlowe". so too did the publisher edward blount, in the dedication of "hero and leander" to sir thomas walsingham. among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about marlowe was the anonymous author of the cambridge university play "the return from parnassus" (1598) who wrote, "pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell".
the most famous tribute to marlowe was paid by shakespeare in "as you like it", where he not only quotes a line from "hero and leander" ("dead shepherd, now i find thy saw of might, 'who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?) but also gives to the clown touchstone the words "when a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room". this appears to be a reference to marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the "reckoning", the bill, as well as to a line in marlowe's "jew of malta"; "infinite riches in a little room".
shakespeare was much influenced by marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the use of marlovian themes in "antony and cleopatra", "the merchant of venice", "richard ii" and "macbeth" ("dido", "jew of malta", "edward ii" and "doctor faustus", respectively). in "hamlet", after meeting with the travelling actors, hamlet requests the player perform a speech about the trojan war, which at 2.2.429–32 has an echo of marlowe's "dido, queen of carthage". in "love's labour's lost" shakespeare brings on a character "marcade" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of marlowe's character "mercury", also attending the king of navarre, in "massacre at paris". the significance, to those of shakespeare's audience who had read "hero and leander", was marlowe's identification of himself with the god mercury.
an argument has arisen about the notion that marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of william shakespeare. orthodox academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship of shakespeare's plays and sonnets, including marlowe.
a marlowe memorial in the form of a bronze sculpture of "the muse of poetry" by edward onslow ford was erected by subscription in buttermarket, canterbury in 1891. in july 2002, a memorial window to marlowe, a gift of the marlowe society, was unveiled in poets' corner in westminster abbey. controversially, a question mark was added to the generally accepted date of death. on 25 october 2011 a letter from paul edmondson and stanley wells was published by "the times" newspaper, in which they called on the dean and chapter to remove the question mark on the grounds that it "flew in the face of a mass of unimpugnable evidence". in 2012, they renewed this call in their e-book "shakespeare bites back", adding that it "denies history" and again the following year in their book "shakespeare beyond doubt".
marlowe has been used as a character in plays, novels, films and tv-productions.
the dates of composition are approximate.
the play "lust's dominion" was attributed to marlowe upon its initial publication in 1657, though scholars and critics have almost unanimously rejected the attribution. he may also have written or co-written "arden of faversham".

caving – also known as spelunking in the united states and canada and potholing in the united kingdom and ireland – is the recreational pastime of exploring wild (generally non-commercial) cave systems. in contrast, speleology is the scientific study of caves and the cave environment.
the challenges involved in caving vary according to the cave being visited; in addition to the total absence of light beyond the entrance, negotiating pitches, squeezes, and water hazards can be difficult. cave diving is a distinct, and more hazardous, sub-speciality undertaken by a small minority of technically proficient cavers. in an area of overlap between recreational pursuit and scientific study, the most devoted and serious-minded cavers become accomplished at the surveying and mapping of caves and the formal publication of their efforts. these are usually published freely and publicly, especially in the uk and other european countries, although in the us, these are generally private.
sometimes categorized as an "extreme sport", it is not commonly considered as such by longtime enthusiasts, who may dislike the term for its connotation of disregard for safety.
many caving skills overlap with those involved in canyoning and mine and urban exploration.
caving is often undertaken for the enjoyment of the outdoor activity or for physical exercise, as well as original exploration, similar to mountaineering or diving. physical or biological science is also an important goal for some cavers, while others are engaged in cave photography. virgin cave systems comprise some of the last unexplored regions on earth and much effort is put into trying to locate, enter and survey them. in well-explored regions (such as most developed nations), the most accessible caves have already been explored, and gaining access to new caves often requires cave digging or cave diving.
caving, in certain areas, has also been utilized as a form of eco and adventure tourism, for example in new zealand. tour companies have established an industry leading and guiding tours into and through caves. depending on the type of cave and the type of tour, the experience could be adventure-based or ecological-based. there are tours led through lava tubes by a guiding service (e.g. lava river cave, the oceanic islands of tenerife, iceland and hawaii).
caving has also been described as an "individualist's team sport" by some, as cavers can often make a trip without direct physical assistance from others but will generally go in a group for companionship or to provide emergency help if needed. some however consider the assistance cavers give each other as a typical team sport activity.
the base term "caving" comes from the latin "cavea" or "caverna", meaning simply, a cave.
"potholing" refers to the act of exploring "potholes", a word originating in the north of england for predominantly vertical caves.
clay perry, an american caver of the 1940s, wrote about a group of men and boys who explored and studied caves throughout new england. this group referred to themselves as "spelunkers", a term derived from the latin "" ("cave, cavern, den"), itself from the greek "spēlynks" ("cave"). this is regarded as the first use of the word in the americas. throughout the 1950s, "spelunking" was the general term used for exploring caves in us english. it was used freely, without any positive or negative connotations, although only rarely outside the us.
in the 1960s, the terms "spelunking" and "spelunker" began to be considered déclassé among experienced enthusiasts. in 1985, steve knutson – editor of the national speleological society (nss) publication "american caving accidents" – made the following distinction:
this sentiment is exemplified by bumper stickers and t-shirts displayed by some cavers: "cavers rescue spelunkers". nevertheless, outside the caving community, "spelunking" and "spelunkers" predominately remain neutral terms referring to the practice and practitioners, without any respect to skill level.
in the mid-nineteenth century, john birkbeck explored potholes in england, notably gaping gill in 1842 and alum pot in 1847-8, returning there in the 1870s. in the mid-1880s, herbert e. balch began exploring wookey hole caves and in the 1890s, balch was introduced to the caves of the mendip hills. one of the oldest established caving clubs, yorkshire ramblers' club, was founded in 1892.
caving as a specialized pursuit was pioneered by édouard-alfred martel (1859–1938), who first achieved the descent and exploration of the gouffre de padirac, in france, as early as 1889 and the first complete descent of a 110-metre wet vertical shaft at gaping gill in 1895. he developed his own techniques based on ropes and metallic ladders. martel visited kentucky and notably mammoth cave national park in october 1912. in the 1920s famous us caver floyd collins made important explorations in the area and in the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular, small exploration teams both in the alps and in the karstic high plateaus of southwest france (causses and pyrenees) transformed cave exploration into both a scientific and recreational activity. robert de joly, guy de lavaur and norbert casteret were prominent figures of that time, surveying mostly caves in southwest france. during world war ii, an alpine team composed of pierre chevalier, fernand petzl, charles petit-didier and others explored the dent de crolles cave system near grenoble, which became the deepest explored system in the world (-658m) at that time. the lack of available equipment during the war forced pierre chevalier and the rest of the team to develop their own equipment, leading to technical innovation. the scaling-pole (1940), nylon ropes (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947) and mechanical rope-ascenders (henri brenot's "monkeys", first used by chevalier and brenot in a cave in 1934) can be directly associated to the exploration of the dent de crolles cave system.
in 1941, american cavers organized themselves into the national speleological society (nss) to advance the exploration, conservation, study and understanding of caves in the united states. american caver bill cuddington, known as "vertical bill", further developed the single-rope technique (srt) in the late 1950s. in 1958, two swiss alpinists, juesi and marti teamed together, creating the first rope ascender known as the jumar. in 1968 bruno dressler asked fernand petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the petzl croll, that he had developed by adapting the jumar to vertical caving. pursuing these developments, petzl started in the 1970s a caving equipment manufacturing company named petzl. the development of the rappel rack and the evolution of mechanical ascension systems extended the practice and safety of vertical exploration to a wider range of cavers.
hard hats are worn to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks. the caver's primary light source is usually mounted on the helmet in order to keep the hands free. electric led lights are most common. many cavers carry two or more sources of light – one as primary and the others as backup in case the first fails. more often than not, a second light will be mounted to the helmet for quick transition if the primary fails. carbide lamp systems are an older form of illumination, inspired by miner's equipment, and are still used by some cavers, particularly on remote expeditions where electric charging facilities are not available.
the type of clothes worn underground varies according to the environment of the cave being explored, and the local culture. in cold caves, the caver may wear a warm base layer that retains its insulating properties when wet, such as a fleece ("furry") suit or polypropylene underwear, and an oversuit of hard-wearing (e.g., cordura) or waterproof (e.g., pvc) material. lighter clothing may be worn in warm caves, particularly if the cave is dry, and in tropical caves thin polypropylene clothing is used, to provide some abrasion protection while remaining as cool as possible. wetsuits may be worn if the cave is particularly wet or involves stream passages. on the feet boots are worn – hiking-style boots in drier caves, or rubber boots (such as wellies) often with neoprene socks ("wetsocks") in wetter caves. knee-pads (and sometimes elbow-pads) are popular for protecting joints during crawls. depending on the nature of the cave, gloves are sometimes worn to protect the hands against abrasion or cold. in pristine areas and for restoration, clean oversuits and powder-free, non-latex surgical gloves are used to protect the cave itself from contaminants.
ropes are used for descending or ascending pitches (single rope technique or srt) or for protection. knots commonly used in caving are the figure-of-eight- (or figure-of-nine-) loop, bowline, alpine butterfly, and italian hitch. ropes are usually rigged using bolts, slings, and carabiners. in some cases cavers may choose to bring and use a flexible metal ladder.
in addition to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing first-aid kits, emergency equipment, and food. containers for securely transporting urine are also commonly carried. on longer trips, containers for securely transporting feces out of the cave are carried.
during very long trips, it may be necessary to camp in the cave – some cavers have stayed underground for many days, or in particularly extreme cases, for weeks at a time. this is particularly the case when exploring or mapping very extended cave systems, where it would be impractical to retrace the route back to the surface regularly. such long trips necessitate the cavers carrying provisions, sleeping and cooking equipment.
caves can be dangerous places; hypothermia, falling, flooding, falling rocks and physical exhaustion are the main risks. rescuing people from underground is difficult and time-consuming, and requires special skills, training, and equipment. full-scale cave rescues often involve the efforts of dozens of rescue workers (often other long-time cavers who have participated in specialized courses, as normal rescue staff are not sufficiently experienced in cave environments), who may themselves be put in jeopardy in effecting the rescue. this said, caving is not necessarily a high-risk sport (especially if it does not involve difficult climbs or diving). as in all physical sports, knowing one's limitations is key.
caving in warmer climates carries the risk of contracting histoplasmosis, a fungal infection that is contracted from bird or bat droppings. it can cause pneumonia and can disseminate in the body to cause continued infections.
in many parts of the world, leptospirosis ("a type of bacterial infection spread by animals" including rats) is a distinct threat due to the presence of rat urine in rainwater or precipitation that enters the caves water system. complications are uncommon, but can be serious.
safety risks while caving can be minimized by using a number of techniques:
many cave environments are very fragile. many speleothems can be damaged by even the slightest touch and some by impacts as slight as a breath. research suggests that increased carbon dioxide levels can lead to "a higher equilibrium concentration of calcium within the drip waters feeding the speleothems, and hence causes dissolution of existing features." in 2008, researchers found evidence that respiration from cave visitors may generate elevated carbon dioxide concentrations in caves, leading to increased temperatures of up to 3 °c and a dissolution of existing features.
pollution is also of concern. since water that flows through a cave eventually comes out in streams and rivers, any pollution may ultimately end up in someone's drinking water, and can even seriously affect the surface environment, as well. even minor pollution such as dropping organic material can have a dramatic effect on the cave biota.
cave-dwelling species are also very fragile, and often, a particular species found in a cave may live within that cave alone, and be found nowhere else in the world, such as alabama cave shrimp. cave-dwelling species are accustomed to a near-constant climate of temperature and humidity, and any disturbance can be disruptive to the species' life cycles. though cave wildlife may not always be immediately visible, it is typically nonetheless present in most caves.
bats are one such fragile species of cave-dwelling animal. bats which hibernate are most vulnerable during the winter season, when no food supply exists on the surface to replenish the bat's store of energy should it be awakened from hibernation. bats which migrate are most sensitive during the summer months when they are raising their young. for these reasons, visiting caves inhabited by hibernating bats is discouraged during cold months; and visiting caves inhabited by migratory bats is discouraged during the warmer months when they are most sensitive and vulnerable. due to an affliction affecting bats in the northeastern us known as white nose syndrome (wns), the us fish & wildlife service has called for a moratorium effective march 26, 2009, on caving activity in states known to have hibernacula (md, ny, vt, nh, ma, ct, nj, pa, va, and wv) affected by wns, as well as adjoining states.
some cave passages may be marked with flagging tape or other indicators to show biologically, aesthetically, or archaeologically sensitive areas. marked paths may show ways around notably fragile areas such as a pristine floor of sand or silt which may be thousands of years old, dating from the last time water flowed through the cave. such deposits may easily be spoiled forever by a single misplaced step. active formations such as flowstone can be similarly marred with a muddy footprint or handprint, and ancient human artifacts, such as fiber products, may even crumble to dust under all but the most gentle touch.
in 1988, concerned that cave resources were becoming increasingly damaged through unregulated use, congress enacted the federal cave resources protection act, giving land management agencies in the united states expanded authority to manage cave conservation on public land.
in europe there have been some panoramic 360° records and vr projects as a means of sharing interesting caves or quarries:
cavers in many countries have created organizations for the administration and oversight of caving activities within their nations. the oldest of these is the french federation of speleology (originally société de spéléologie) founded by édouard-alfred martel in 1895, which produced the first periodical journal in speleology, "spelunca". the first university-based speleological institute in the world was founded in 1920 in cluj-napoca, romania, by emil racovita, a romanian biologist, zoologist, speleologist and explorer of antarctica.
the british speleological association was established in 1935 and the national speleological society in the us was founded in 1941 (originally formed as the speleological society of the district of columbia on may 6, 1939).
an international speleological congress was proposed at a meeting in valence-sur-rhone, france in 1949 and first held in 1953 in paris. the international union of speleology (uis) was founded in 1965.

a cave or cavern is a natural void in the ground, specifically a space large enough for a human to enter. caves often form by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground. the word "cave" can also refer to much smaller openings such as sea caves, rock shelters, and grottos, though strictly speaking a cave is exogene, meaning it is deeper than its opening is wide, and a rock shelter is endogene.
speleology is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the cave environment. visiting or exploring caves for recreation may be called "caving", "potholing", or "spelunking".
the formation and development of caves is known as "speleogenesis"; it can occur over the course of millions of years. caves can range widely in size, and are formed by various geological processes. these may involve a combination of chemical processes, erosion by water, tectonic forces, microorganisms, pressure, and atmospheric influences. isotopic dating techniques can be applied to cave sediments, to determine the timescale of the geological events which formed and shaped present-day caves.
it is estimated that a cave cannot exceed in depth due to the pressure of overlying rocks. for karst caves the maximum depth is determined on the basis of the lower limit of karst forming processes, coinciding with the base of the soluble carbonate rocks. most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution.
caves can be classified in various other ways as well, including a contrast between active and relict: active caves have water flowing through them; relict caves do not, though water may be retained in them. types of active caves include inflow caves ("into which a stream sinks"), outflow caves ("from which a stream emerges"), and through caves ("traversed by a stream").
solutional caves or karst caves are the most frequently occurring caves. such caves form in rock that is soluble; most occur in limestone, but they can also form in other rocks including chalk, dolomite, marble, salt, and gypsum. rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through bedding planes, faults, joints, and comparable features. over time cracks enlarge to become caves and cave systems.
the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone. limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with hco (carbonic acid) and naturally occurring organic acids. the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as "karst", characterized by sinkholes and underground drainage. limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation. these include flowstones, stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, soda straws and columns. these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called "speleothems".
the portions of a solutional cave that are below the water table or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded.
lechuguilla cave in new mexico and nearby carlsbad cavern are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave. they were formed by hs (hydrogen sulfide) gas rising from below, where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes. this gas mixes with groundwater and forms hso (sulfuric acid). the acid then dissolves the limestone from below, rather than from above, by acidic water percolating from the surface.
caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called primary caves.
lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves. as lava flows downhill, its surface cools and solidifies. hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust, and if most of it flows out, a hollow tube remains. such caves can be found in the canary islands, jeju-do, the basaltic plains of eastern idaho, and in other places. kazumura cave near hilo, hawaii is a remarkably long and deep lava tube; it is .
lava caves include but are not limited to lava tubes. other caves formed through volcanic activity include rifts, lava molds, open vertical conduits, inflationary, blisters, among others.
sea caves are found along coasts around the world. a special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. elsewhere, in places such as thailand's phang nga bay, solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. sea caves are generally around in length, but may exceed .
corrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments. these can form in any type of rock, including hard rocks such as granite. generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water, such as a fault or joint. a subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave, carved by wind-born sediments. many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them.
glacier caves are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers. the cavities are influenced by the very slow flow of the ice, which tends to collapse the caves again. glacier caves are sometimes misidentified as "ice caves", though this latter term is properly reserved for bedrock caves that contain year-round ice formations.
fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals, such as gypsum, dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock. these rocks fracture and collapse in blocks of stone.
talus caves are formed by the openings among large boulders that have fallen down into a random heap, often at the bases of cliffs. these unstable deposits are called talus or scree, and may be subject to frequent rockfalls and landslides.
anchialine caves are caves, usually coastal, containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water (usually sea water). they occur in many parts of the world, and often contain highly specialized and endemic fauna.
caves are found throughout the world, but only a small portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers. the distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years (such as france, italy, australia, the uk, the united states, etc.). as a result, explored caves are found widely in europe, asia, north america and oceania, but are sparse in south america, africa, and antarctica.
this is a rough generalization, as large expanses of north america and asia contain no documented caves, whereas areas such as the madagascar dry deciduous forests and parts of brazil contain many documented caves. as the world's expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers, the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift. for example, china, despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone—more than —has relatively few documented caves.
cave-inhabiting animals are often categorized as troglobites (cave-limited species), troglophiles (species that can live their entire lives in caves, but also occur in other environments), trogloxenes (species that use caves, but cannot complete their life cycle fully in caves) and accidentals (animals not in one of the previous categories). some authors use separate terminology for aquatic forms (for example, stygobites, stygophiles, and stygoxenes).
of these animals, the troglobites are perhaps the most unusual organisms. troglobitic species often show a number of characteristics, termed troglomorphic, associated with their adaptation to subterranean life. these characteristics may include a loss of pigment (often resulting in a pale or white coloration), a loss of eyes (or at least of optical functionality), an elongation of appendages, and an enhancement of other senses (such as the ability to sense vibrations in water). aquatic troglobites (or stygobites), such as the endangered alabama cave shrimp, live in bodies of water found in caves and get nutrients from detritus washed into their caves and from the feces of bats and other cave inhabitants. other aquatic troglobites include cave fish, and cave salamanders such as the olm and the texas blind salamander.
cave insects such as oligaphorura (formerly archaphorura) schoetti are troglophiles, reaching in length. they have extensive distribution and have been studied fairly widely. most specimens are female, but a male specimen was collected from st cuthberts swallet in 1969.
bats, such as the gray bat and mexican free-tailed bat, are trogloxenes and are often found in caves; they forage outside of the caves. some species of cave crickets are classified as trogloxenes, because they roost in caves by day and forage above ground at night.
because of the fragile nature of the cave ecosystem, and the fact that cave regions tend to be isolated from one another, caves harbor a number of endangered species, such as the tooth cave spider, liphistius trapdoor spider, and the gray bat.
caves are visited by many surface-living animals, including humans. these are usually relatively short-lived incursions, due to the lack of light and sustenance.
cave entrances often have typical florae. for instance, in the eastern temperate united states, cave entrances are most frequently (and often densely) populated by the bulblet fern, "cystopteris bulbifera".
throughout history, primitive peoples have made use of caves. the earliest human fossils found in caves come from a series of caves near krugersdorp and mokopane in south africa. the cave sites of sterkfontein, swartkrans, kromdraai b, drimolen, malapa, cooper's d, gladysvale, gondolin and makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago, including australopithecus africanus, australopithecus sediba and paranthropus robustus. however, it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves, but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them.
the first early hominid ever found in africa, the taung child in 1924, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being predated on by an eagle. however, this is now debated (hopley et al., 2013; am. j. phys. anthrop.). caves do form in the dolomite of the ghaap plateau, including the early, middle and later stone age site of wonderwerk cave; however, the caves that form along the escarpment's edge, like that hypothesised for the taung child, are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called tufa. there is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world, including homo erectus in china at zhoukoudian, homo rhodesiensis in south africa at the cave of hearths (makapansgat), homo neandertalensis and homo heidelbergensis in europe at archaeological site of atapuerca, homo floresiensis in indonesia, and the denisovans in southern siberia.
in southern africa, early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about 180,000 years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time (marean et al., 2007; nature). the oldest known site is pp13b at pinnacle point. this may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of africa and colonization of areas of the world such as australia by 60–50,000 years ago. throughout southern africa, australia, and europe, early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art, such as those at giants castle. caves such as the yaodong in china were used for shelter; other caves were used for burials (such as rock-cut tombs), or as religious sites (such as ). among the known sacred caves are china's cave of a thousand buddhas and the sacred caves of crete.

chinese numerals are words and characters used to denote numbers in chinese.
today, speakers of chinese use three written numeral systems: the system of hindu-arabic numerals used worldwide, and two indigenous systems. the more familiar indigenous system is based on chinese characters that correspond to numerals in the spoken language. these are shared with other languages of the chinese cultural sphere such as japanese, korean and vietnamese. most people and institutions in china and taiwan primarily use the hindu-arabic or mixed arabic-chinese systems for convenience, with traditional chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.
the other indigenous system is the suzhou numerals, or "huama", a positional system, the only surviving form of the rod numerals. these were once used by chinese mathematicians, and later in chinese markets, such as those in hong kong before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by hindu-arabic (and also roman) numerals.
the chinese character numeral system consists of the chinese characters used by the chinese written language to write spoken numerals. similar to spelling-out numbers in english (e.g., "one thousand nine hundred forty-five"), it is not an independent system "per se". since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in arabic numerals, in the same way that spelling out numbers in english does not.
there are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. there are two sets of characters for chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as "xiǎoxiě" (), and one for use in commercial or financial contexts, known as "dàxiě" (). the latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in english would. a forger could easily change the everyday characters 三十 (30) to 五千 (5000) just by adding a few strokes. that would not be possible when writing using the financial characters 叁拾 (30) and 伍仟 (5000). they are also referred to as "banker's numerals", "anti-fraud numerals", or "banker's anti-fraud numerals". for the same reason, rod numerals were never used in commercial records.
t denotes traditional chinese characters, while s denotes simplified chinese characters.
in the people's liberation army of the people's republic of china, some numbers will have altered names when used for clearer radio communications. they are:
for numbers larger than 10,000, similarly to the long and short scales in the west, there have been four systems in ancient and modern usage. the original one, with unique names for all powers of ten up to the 14th, is ascribed to the yellow emperor in the 6th century book by zhen luan, "wujing suanshu" (arithmetic in five classics). in modern chinese only the second system is used, in which the same ancient names are used, but each represents a number 10,000 (myriad, 萬 wàn) times the previous:
in practice, this situation does not lead to ambiguity, with the exception of 兆 (zhào), which means 10 according to the system in common usage throughout the chinese communities as well as in japan and korea, but has also been used for 10 in recent years (especially in mainland china for megabyte). to avoid problems arising from the ambiguity, the prc government never uses this character in official documents, but uses 万亿 (wànyì) or 太 (tài, as the translation for "tera") instead. partly due to this, combinations of 万 and 亿 are often used instead of the larger units of the traditional system as well, for example 亿亿 (yìyì) instead of 京. the roc government in taiwan uses 兆 (zhào) to mean 10 in official documents.
numerals beyond 載 zǎi come from buddhist texts in sanskrit, but are mostly found in ancient texts. some of the following words are still being used today, but may have transferred meanings.
the following are characters used to denote small order of magnitude in chinese historically. with the introduction of si units, some of them have been incorporated as si prefixes, while the rest have fallen into disuse.
in the people's republic of china, the early translation for the si prefixes in 1981 was different from those used today. the larger (兆, 京, 垓, 秭, 穰) and smaller chinese numerals (微, 纖, 沙, 塵, 渺) were defined as translation for the si prefixes as "mega", "giga", "tera", "peta", "exa", "micro", "nano", "pico", "femto", "atto", resulting in the creation of yet more values for each numeral.
the republic of china (taiwan) defined 百萬 as the translation for "mega" and 兆 as the translation for "tera". this translation is widely used in official documents, academic communities, informational industries, etc. however, the civil broadcasting industries sometimes use 兆赫 to represent "megahertz".
today, the governments of both china and taiwan use phonetic transliterations for the si prefixes. however, the governments have each chosen different chinese characters for certain prefixes. the following table lists the two different standards together with the early translation.
multiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.
in mandarin, the multiplier ("liǎng") is often used rather than ("èr") for all numbers 200 and greater with the "2" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). use of both 兩 ("liǎng") or 二 ("èr") are acceptable for the number 200. when writing in the cantonese dialect, 二 ("yi") is used to represent the "2" numeral for all numbers. in the southern min dialect of chaozhou (teochew), 兩 ("no") is used to represent the "2" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards. thus:
for the numbers 11 through 19, the leading "one" () is usually omitted. in some dialects, like shanghainese, when there are only two significant digits in the number, the leading "one" and the trailing zeroes are omitted. sometimes, the one before "ten" in the middle of a number, such as 213, is omitted. thus:
notes:
in certain older texts like the protestant bible or in poetic usage, numbers such as 114 may be "written" as [100] [10] [4] ().
outside of taiwan, digits are sometimes grouped by myriads instead of thousands. hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890. larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 × () = (). if one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading "one" is omitted as per the above point. hence (numbers in parentheses indicate that the number has been written as one number rather than expanded):
in taiwan, pure arabic numerals are officially always and only grouped by thousands. unofficially, they are often not grouped, particularly for numbers below 100,000. mixed arabic-chinese numerals are often used in order to denote myriads. this is used both officially and unofficially, and come in a variety of styles:
interior zeroes before the unit position (as in 1002) must be spelt explicitly. the reason for this is that trailing zeroes (as in 1200) are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs. one zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity. where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred. thus:
to construct a fraction, the denominator is written first, followed by ("parts of/dividing") and then the numerator. this is the opposite of how fractions are read in english, which is numerator first. each half of the fraction is written the same as a whole number. mixed numbers are written with the whole-number part first, followed by ("and"), then the fractional part.
percentages are constructed similarly, using (100) as the denominator. the (one) before is omitted. (like the english "one hundred" or "a hundred", typically the quantity 100 is denoted in chinese.)
decimal numbers are constructed by first writing the whole number part, then inserting a point (), and finally the decimal expression. the decimal expression is written using only the digits for 0 to 9, without multiplicative words.
, [half] functions as a number and therefore requires a measure word. example: is "half a glass of water".
ordinal numbers are formed by adding ("sequence") before the number.
negative numbers are formed by adding fù () before the number.
chinese grammar requires the use of classifiers (measure words) when a numeral is used together with a noun to express a quantity. for example, "three people" is expressed as , "three ( particle) person", where / "" is a classifier. there exist many different classifiers, for use with different sets of nouns, although / is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers.
chinese uses cardinal numbers in certain situations in which english would use ordinals. for example, (literally "three story/storey") means "third floor" ("second floor" in british ). likewise, (literally "twenty-one century") is used for "21st century".
numbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in ("two zero zero one") for the year 2001. names of months and days (in the western system) are also expressed using numbers: ("one month") for january, etc.; and ("week one") for monday, etc. only one exception, sunday is , or informally , both literally "week day". when meaning "week", "" and "" are interchangeable. "" or "" means "day of worship". chinese catholics call sunday "" "", "lord's day".
full dates are usually written in the format 2001年1月20日 for january 20, 2001 (using "year", "month", and "day") – all the numbers are read as cardinals, not ordinals, with no leading zeroes, and the year is read as a sequence of digits. for brevity the , and may be dropped to give a date composed of just numbers. for example "6-4" in chinese is "six-four", short for "month six, day four" i.e. june fourth, a common chinese shorthand for the 1989 tiananmen square protests (because of the violence that occurred on june 4th). for another example 67, in chinese is sixty seven, short for year nineteen sixty seven, a common chinese shorthand for the hong kong 1967 leftist riots.
in the same way that roman numerals were standard in ancient and medieval europe for mathematics and commerce, the chinese formerly used the rod numerals, which is a positional system. the suzhou numerals () system is a variation of the southern song rod numerals. nowadays, the "huāmǎ" system is only used for displaying prices in chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.
there is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. while the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.
most chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the shang dynasty oracle numerals of the 14th century bc. the oracle bone script numerals were found on tortoise shell and animal bones. in early civilizations, the shang were able to express any numbers, however large, with only nine symbols and a counting board.
some of the bronze script numerals such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 became part of the system of rod numerals.
in this system, horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc. it's written in "sunzi suanjing" that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal".
the counting rod numerals system has place value and decimal numerals for computation, and was used widely by chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the han dynasty to the 16th century.
in ad 690, empress wǔ promulgated zetian characters, one of which was "〇". the word is now used as a synonym for the number zero.
alexander wylie, christian missionary to china, in 1853 already refuted the notion that "the chinese numbers were written in words at length", and stated that in ancient china, calculation was carried out by means of counting rods, and "the written character is evidently a rude presentation of these". after being introduced to the rod numerals, he said "having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the arabs."
during the ming and qing dynasties (after arabic numerals were introduced into china), some chinese mathematicians used chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. after the qing period, both the chinese numeral characters and the suzhou numerals were replaced by arabic numerals in mathematical writings.
traditional chinese numeric characters are also used in japan and korea and were used in vietnam before the 20th century. in vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, arabic numerals are most common. chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that roman numerals are in western cultures. chinese numerals may appear together with arabic numbers on the same sign or document.

a computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. most computer devices require programs to function properly.
a computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. from the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine code—a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter.
a collection of computer programs, libraries, and related data are referred to as software. computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as application software and system software. the underlying method used for some calculation or manipulation is known as an algorithm.
the earliest programmable machines preceded the invention of the digital computer. in 1801, joseph-marie jacquard devised a loom that would weave a pattern by following a series of perforated cards. patterns could be woven and repeated by arranging the cards.
in 1837, charles babbage was inspired by jacquard's loom to attempt to build the analytical engine.
the names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. in the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. the device would have had a "store"—memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each. numbers from the "store" would then have then been transferred to the "mill" (analogous to the cpu of a modern machine), for processing. and a "thread" being the execution of programmed instructions by the device. it was programmed using two sets of perforated cards—one to direct the operation and the other for the input variables.
during a nine-month period in 1842–43, ada lovelace translated the memoir of italian mathematician luigi menabrea. the memoir covered the analytical engine. the translation contained note g which completely detailed a method for calculating bernoulli numbers using the analytical engine. this note is recognized by some historians as the world's first written computer program.
in 1936, alan turing introduced the universal turing machine—a theoretical device that can model every computation that can be performed on a turing complete computing machine.
it is a finite-state machine that has an infinitely long read/write tape. the machine can move the tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an algorithm. the machine starts in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state.
this machine is considered by some to be the origin of the stored-program computer—used by john von neumann (1946) for the "electronic computing instrument" that now bears the von neumann architecture name.
the z3 computer, invented by konrad zuse (1941) in germany, was a digital and programmable computer. a digital computer uses electricity as the calculating component. the z3 contained 2,400 relays to create the circuits. the circuits provided a binary, floating-point, nine-instruction computer. programming the z3 was through a specially designed keyboard and punched tape.
the electronic numerical integrator and computer (fall 1945) was a turing complete, general-purpose computer that used 17,468 vacuum tubes to create the circuits. at its core, it was a series of pascalines wired together. its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied , and consumed $650 per hour (in 1940s currency) in electricity when idle. it had 20 base-10 accumulators. programming the eniac took up to two months. three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables. each function table had 728 rotating knobs. programming the eniac also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. debugging a program took a week. the programmers of the eniac were women who were known collectively as the "eniac girls." the eniac featured parallel operations. different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms. it used punched card machines for input and output, and it was controlled with a clock signal. it ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.
the manchester baby (june 1948) was a stored-program computer. programming transitioned away from moving cables and setting dials; instead, a computer program was stored in memory as numbers. only three bits of memory were available to store each instruction, so it was limited to eight instructions. 32 switches were available for programming.
computers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. the computer program was written on paper for reference. an instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. after setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. this process was then repeated. computer programs also were manually input via paper tape or punched cards. after the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.
in 1961, the burroughs b5000 was built specifically to be programmed in the algol 60 language. the hardware featured circuits to ease the compile phase.
in 1964, the ibm system/360 was a line of six computers each having the same instruction set architecture. the model 30 was the smallest and least expensive. customers could upgrade and retain the same application software. each system/360 model featured multiprogramming. with operating system support, multiple programs could be in memory at once. when one was waiting for input/output, another could compute. each model also could emulate other computers. customers could upgrade to the system/360 and retain their ibm 7094 or ibm 1401 application software.
computer programming is the process of writing or editing source code. editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. a person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer programmer, software developer, and sometimes coder.
the sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as software development. the term software engineering is becoming popular as the process is seen as an engineering discipline.
computer programs can be categorized by the programming language paradigm used to produce them. two of the main paradigms are imperative and declarative.
"imperative programming languages" specify a sequential algorithm using declarations, expressions, and statements:
one criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.
"declarative programming languages" describe "what" computation should be performed and not "how" to compute it. declarative programs omit the control flow and are considered "sets" of instructions. two broad categories of declarative languages are functional languages and logical languages. the principle behind functional languages (like haskell) is to not allow side effects, which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions. the principle behind logical languages (like prolog) is to define the problem to be solved – the goal – and leave the detailed solution to the prolog system itself. the goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. if a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is backtracked and another path is systematically attempted.
a computer program in the form of a human-readable, computer programming language is called source code. source code may be converted into an executable image by a compiler or executed immediately with the aid of an interpreter.
compilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either object code or machine code. object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the central processing unit's native instructions, ready for execution. compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as binaries – a reference to the binary file format used to store the executable code.
interpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. the interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior. one advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an interactive session. the programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.
the main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. however, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. by contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.
just in time compilers pre-compile computer programs just before execution. for example, the java virtual machine hotspot contains a just in time compiler which selectively compiles java bytecode into machine code – but only code which hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.
either compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a batch process without human interaction.
scripting languages are often used to create batch processes. one common scripting language is unix shell, and its executing environment is called the command-line interface.
no properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. the categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. for example, java is thought of as an interpreted language and c a compiled language, despite the existence of java compilers and c interpreters.
typically, computer programs are stored in non-volatile memory until requested either directly or indirectly to be executed by the computer user. upon such a request, the program is loaded into random-access memory, by a computer program called an operating system, where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. the central processor then executes ("runs") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. a program in execution is called a process. termination is either by normal self-termination, by user intervention, or by error – software or hardware error.
many operating systems support multitasking which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer. operating systems may run multiple programs through process scheduling – a software mechanism to switch the cpu among processes often so users can interact with each program while it runs. within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs.
a computer program in execution is normally treated as being different from the data the program operates on. however, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. the modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. self-modifying code is possible for programs written in machine code, assembly language, lisp, c, cobol, pl/1, and prolog.
computer programs may be categorized along functional lines. the main functional categories are application software and system software. system software includes the operating system which couples computer hardware with application software. the purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner. in addition to the operating system, system software includes embedded programs, boot programs, and micro programs. application software designed for end users have a user interface. application software not designed for the end user includes middleware, which couples one application with another. application software also includes utility programs. the distinction between system software and application software is under debate.
there are many types of application software:
utility programs are application programs designed to aid system administrators and computer programmers.
an operating system is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.
in the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it.
after the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.
more often than not the program did not work.
the programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches. if less fortunate, a memory printout was made for further study.
in the 1960s, programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operator's job. a program called an "operating system" was kept in the computer at all times.
originally, operating systems were programmed in assembly; however, modern operating systems are typically written in c.
a stored-program computer requires an initial computer program stored in its read-only memory to boot. the boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system, from processor registers to device controllers to memory contents. following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the operating system and sets the program counter to begin normal operations.
independent of the host computer, a hardware device might have embedded firmware to control its operation. firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off.
microcode programs control some central processing units and some other hardware. this code moves data between the registers, buses, arithmetic logic units, and other functional units in the cpu. unlike conventional programs, microcode is not usually written by, or even visible to, the end users of systems, and is usually provided by the manufacturer, and is considered internal to the device.

in ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. the term "crime" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. the most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. one proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society or the state ("a public wrong"). such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.
the notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. what precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. while many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.
the state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. in modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. if found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.
usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" ("actus reus") mustwith certain exceptionsbe accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" ("mens rea").
while every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.
when informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired social order, a government or a state may impose more formalized or stricter systems of social control. with institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the state can compel populations to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.
authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or preventing crime. in addition, authorities provide remedies and sanctions, and collectively these constitute a criminal justice system. legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal mutilation, capital punishment or life without parole.
usually, a natural person perpetrates a crime, but legal persons may also commit crimes. conversely, at least under u.s. law, nonpersons such as animals cannot commit crimes.
the sociologist richard quinney has written about the relationship between society and crime. when quinney states "crime is a social phenomenon" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.
the word "crime" is derived from the latin root "cernō", meaning "i decide, i give judgment". originally the latin word "crīmen" meant "charge" or "cry of distress." the ancient greek word "krima" (κρίμα), from which the latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.
in 13th century english "crime" meant "sinfulness", according to etymonline.com. it was probably brought to england as old french "crimne" (12th century form of modern french "crime"), from latin "crimen" (in the genitive case: "criminis"). in latin, "crimen" could have signified any one of the following: "charge, indictment, accusation; crime, fault, offense".
the word may derive from the latin "cernere" – "to decide, to sift" (see crisis, mapped on kairos and chronos). but ernest klein (citing karl brugmann) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant "cry of distress". thomas g. tucker suggests a root in "cry" words and refers to english plaint, plaintiff, and so on. the meaning "offense punishable by law" dates from the late 14th century. the latin word is glossed in old english by "facen", also "deceit, fraud, treachery", [cf. fake]. "crime wave" is first attested in 1893 in american english.
whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission. it depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it. an act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called criminal proceedings.
history
the following definition of "crime" was provided by the prevention of crimes act 1871, and applied for the purposes of section 10 of the prevention of crime act 1908:
for the purpose of section 243 of the trade union and labour relations (consolidation) act 1992, a crime means an offence punishable on indictment, or an offence punishable on summary conviction, and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the statute making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.
a normative definition views crime as deviant behavior that violates prevailing normscultural standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. this approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing social, political, psychological, and economic conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, law-enforcement, and penal responses made by society.
these structural realities remain fluid and often contentious. for example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may criminalise or decriminalise certain behaviours, which directly affects the statistical crime rates, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general public opinion.
similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given "crime problem". all such adjustments to crime statistics, allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the state should use law or social engineering to enforce or encourage any particular social norm. behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.
indeed, in those cases where no clear consensus exists on a given norm, the drafting of criminal law by the group in power to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's freedom, and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in generalwhether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.
legislatures can pass laws (called "mala prohibita") that define crimes against social norms. these laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in gambling laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of duelling in history. other crimes, called "mala in se", count as outlawed in almost all societies, (murder, theft and rape, for example).
english criminal law and the related criminal law of commonwealth countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: common law offences. the courts used the concept of "malum in se" to develop various common law offences.
one can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a deterrent to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. the state becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual liberty, for example, to minimize harm to others).
states control the process of criminalization because:
the label of "crime" and the accompanying social stigma normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the state, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. those who apply the labels of "crime" or "criminal" intend to assert the hegemony of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the state (in the event that standard processing tries and convicts an accused person of a crime).
justifying the state's use of force to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. one of the earliest justifications involved the theory of natural law. this posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of morality or constructs them. thomas aquinas wrote in the 13th century: "the rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts" (aquinas, st i-ii, q.90, a.i). he regarded people as by nature rational beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. in the 1760s william blackstone (1979: 41) described the thesis:
but john austin (1790–1859), an early positivist, applied utilitarianism in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. he denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. thus in austinian terms, a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. similarly, hart (1961) saw the law as an aspect of sovereignty, with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.
thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal logic and consistency, and that the state's agents used state power with responsibility. ronald dworkin (2005) rejects hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. he offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of deference (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.
indeed, despite everything, the majority of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. this view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.
one can solve this problem by granting some degree of moral relativism and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. people may find such law acceptable, but the use of state power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. more recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of individual rights.
since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term "right") rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). adam smith illustrates this view, saying that a smuggler would be an excellent citizen, "...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so."
natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between "criminality" (which derives from human nature) and "illegality" (which originates with the interests of those in power). lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases "malum in se" and "malum prohibitum" respectively. they regard a "crime "malum in se"" as inherently criminal; whereas a "crime "malum prohibitum"" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.
it follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. many enlightenment thinkers (such as adam smith and the american founding fathers) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called classical liberals and libertarians.
some religious communities regard sin as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of originsnote the tale of adam and eve and the theory of original sin. what one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. however, the earliest known civilizations had codes of law, containing both civil and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.
the sumerians produced the earliest surviving written codes. urukagina (reigned , short chronology) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, ur-nammu, left the earliest extant written law system, the code of ur-nammu (), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. the sumerians later issued other codes, including the "code of lipit-ishtar". this code, from the 20th century bce, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources.
successive legal codes in babylon, including the code of hammurabi (), reflected mesopotamian society's belief that law derived from the will of the gods (see babylonian law).
many states at this time functioned as theocracies, with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference. in the sanskrit texts of dharmaśāstra (), issues such as legal and religious duties, code of conduct, penalties and remedies, etc. have been discussed and forms one of the elaborate and earliest source of legal code.
sir henry maine (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the "modern" sense of the word. while modern systems distinguish between offences against the "state" or "community", and offences against the "individual", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with "crimes" (latin: "crimina"), but with "wrongs" (latin: "delicta"). thus the hellenic laws treated all forms of theft, assault, rape, and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. the earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.
the romans systematized law and applied their system across the roman empire. again, the initial rules of roman law regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. the most significant roman law concept involved "dominion". the "pater familias" owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the "pater" enforced matters involving interference with any property. the "commentaries" of gaius (written between 130 and 180 ad) on the twelve tables treated "furtum" (in modern parlance: "theft") as a tort.
similarly, assault and violent robbery involved trespass as to the "pater's" property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the "pater" as having trespassed on his "property"), and breach of such laws created a "vinculum juris" (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern "damages") could discharge. similarly, the consolidated teutonic laws of the germanic tribes, included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would consider the complete range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.
even though rome abandoned its britannic provinces around 400 ad, the germanic mercenarieswho had largely become instrumental in enforcing roman rule in britanniaacquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of roman and teutonic law, with much written down under the early anglo-saxon kings. but only when a more centralized english monarchy emerged following the norman invasion, and when the kings of england attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the "individual", but also as a wrong against the "state".
this idea came from common law, and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the "state" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or "privilegium" against the perpetrator. all the earliest english criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of writ). the development of the idea that the "state" dispenses justice in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of sovereignty.
in continental europe, roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the christian church.
coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in roman jurisprudence, but modified to meet the prevailing political climate.
in scandinavia the effect of roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the "things"the assemblies of the people. the people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). this system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of "the people" of yore.
from the hellenic system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of feuding between clans and families.
if compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. on the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of feudal warfare. both in archaic greece and in medieval scandinavia, an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (compare the united nations security council, in which the veto power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)
these means of restraining private feuds did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. but in the earliest times the "state" did not always provide an independent policing force. thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.
the development of sociological thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of criminology as a study of crime in society. nietzsche noted a link between crime and creativityin "the birth of tragedy" he asserted: "the best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime". in the 20th century michel foucault in "discipline and punish" made a study of criminalization as a coercive method of state control.
the following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms:
researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:
one can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with sentencing tariffs prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. thus fines and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) capital punishment reserved for the most serious.
under the common law of england, crimes were classified as either treason, felony or misdemeanour, with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. this system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. it is still used in the united states but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in england and wales and northern ireland.
the following classes of offence are based on mode of trial:
in common law countries, crimes may be categorised into common law offences and statutory offences. in the us, australia and canada (in particular), they are divided into federal crimes and under state crimes.
in the united states since 1930, the fbi has tabulated uniform crime reports (ucr) annually from crime data submitted by law enforcement agencies across the united states.
officials compile this data at the city, county, and state levels into the ucr. they classify violations of laws based on common law as part i (index) crimes in ucr data. these are further categorized as violent or property crimes. part i violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while part i property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. all other crimes count come under part ii.
for convenience, such lists usually include infractions although, in the u.s., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the civil law. compare tortfeasance.
booking arrests require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.
there are several national and international organizations offering studies and statistics about global and local crime activity, such as united nations office on drugs and crime, the united states of america overseas security advisory council (osac) safety report or national reports generated by the law-enforcement authorities of eu state member reported to the europol.
in england and wales, as well as in hong kong, the term "offence" means the same thing as, and is interchangeable with, the term "crime", they are further split into:
many different causes and correlates of crime have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. they include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. controversial topics include media violence research and effects of gun politics.
emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. the positive psychology concept of broaden and build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines. in positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. the narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.
crimes defined by treaty as crimes against international law include:
from the point of view of state-centric law, extraordinary procedures (usually international courts) may prosecute such crimes. note the role of the international criminal court at the hague in the netherlands.
different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) alcohol consumption (prohibition), abortion and stem-cell research. in various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as roman catholic canon law.
in the military sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as mutiny or desertion) under martial-law codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.
many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a state of emergency in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. undesired activities at such times may include assembly in the streets, violation of curfew, or possession of firearms.
two common types of employee crime exist: embezzlement and wage theft.
the complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations. the victims of the most costly scams include banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.
in the united states, it is estimated that workers are not paid at least $19 billion every year in overtime and that in total $40 billion to $60 billion are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft. this compares to national annual losses of $340 million due to robbery, $4.1 billion due to burglary, $5.3 billion due to larceny, and $3.8 billion due to auto theft in 2012. in singapore, as in the united states, wage theft was found to be widespread and severe. in a 2014 survey it was found that as many as one-third of low wage male foreign workers in singapore, or about 130,000, were affected by wage theft from partial to full denial of pay.

the california institute of technology (caltech) is a private doctorate-granting research university in pasadena, california. known for its strength in natural science and engineering, caltech is often ranked as one of the world's top-ten universities.
although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by amos g. throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as george ellery hale, arthur amos noyes and robert andrews millikan in the early 20th century. the vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1921. in 1934, caltech was elected to the association of american universities and the antecedents of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, which caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under theodore von kármán. the university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the united states which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.
caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research. its primary campus is located approximately northeast of downtown los angeles. first-year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus house system at caltech. although caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks, student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. the caltech beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the ncaa division iii's southern california intercollegiate athletic conference.
, caltech alumni, faculty and researchers include 73 nobel laureates (chemist linus pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes), 4 fields medalists, and 6 turing award winners. in addition, there are 53 non-emeritus faculty members (as well as many emeritus faculty members) who have been elected to one of the united states national academies, 4 chief scientists of the u.s. air force and 71 have won the united states national medal of science or technology. numerous faculty members are associated with the howard hughes medical institute as well as nasa. according to a 2015 pomona college study, caltech ranked number one in the u.s. for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a phd.
caltech started as a vocational school founded in pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician amos g. throop. the school was known successively as throop university, throop polytechnic institute (and manual training school) and throop college of technology before acquiring its current name in 1920. the vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent polytechnic school in 1907.
at a time when scientific research in the united states was still in its infancy, george ellery hale, a solar astronomer from the university of chicago, founded the mount wilson observatory in 1904. he joined throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. he engineered the appointment of james a. b. scherer, a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to throop's presidency in 1908. scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee charles w. gates to donate $25,000 in seed money to build gates laboratory, the first science building on campus.
in 1910, throop moved to its current site. arthur fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site. theodore roosevelt delivered an address at throop institute on march 21, 1911, and he declared:
i want to see institutions like throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; i want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the panama canal and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the one-hundredth man i want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer, george ellery hale.
in the same year, a bill was introduced in the california legislature calling for the establishment of a publicly funded "california institute of technology", with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of throop at the time. the board of trustees offered to turn throop over to the state, but the presidents of stanford university and the university of california successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern california, public or private, until the onset of the world war ii necessitated the broader development of research-based science education. the promise of throop attracted physical chemist arthur amos noyes from mit to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.
with the onset of world war i, hale organized the national research council to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. while he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. to that end, as hale wrote in "the new york times":
throop college of technology, in pasadena california has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the research council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. this institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. president scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.
through the national research council, hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for throop to play a national role in science. the new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately led to the establishment of the norman bridge laboratory, which attracted experimental physicist robert andrews millikan from the university of chicago in 1917. during the course of the war, hale, noyes and millikan worked together in washington on the nrc. subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing caltech.
under the leadership of hale, noyes, and millikan (aided by the booming economy of southern california), caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of roosevelt's "hundredth man". on november 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time "to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as english, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research". in 1923, millikan was awarded the nobel prize in physics. in 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired william bennett munro, then chairman of the division of history, government, and economics at harvard university, to create a division of humanities and social sciences at caltech. in 1928, a division of biology was established under the leadership of thomas hunt morgan, the most distinguished biologist in the united states at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the chromosome in heredity. in 1930, kerckhoff marine laboratory was established in corona del mar under the care of professor george macginitie. in 1926, a graduate school of aeronautics was created, which eventually attracted theodore von kármán. kármán later helped create the jet propulsion laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing caltech as one of the world's centers for rocket science. in 1928, construction of the palomar observatory began.
millikan served as "chairman of the executive council" (effectively caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the institute was occasionally referred to as "millikan's school." millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining caltech. scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as paul dirac, erwin schrödinger, werner heisenberg, hendrik lorentz and niels bohr. albert einstein arrived on the caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his theory of general relativity, and he returned to caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.
during world war ii, caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the v-12 navy college training program which offered students a path to a navy commission. the united states navy also maintained a naval training school for aeronautical engineering, resident inspectors of ordinance and naval material, and a liaison officer to the national defense research committee on campus.
from april 1 to december 1, 1951, caltech was the host of a federal classified study, project vista. the selection of caltech as host for the project was based on the university's expertise in rocketry and nuclear physics. in response to the war in korea and the pressure from the soviet union, the project was caltech's way of assisting the federal government in its effort to increase national security. the project was created to study new ways of improving the relationship between tactical air support and ground troops. the army, air force, and navy sponsored the project, however it was under contract with the army. the study was named after the hotel, vista del arroyo hotel, which housed the study. the study operated under a committee with the supervision of president lee a. dubridge. william a. fowler, a professor at caltech, was selected as research director. more than a fourth of caltech's faculty and a group of outside scientists staffed the project. moreover, the number increases if one takes into account visiting scientists, military liaisons, secretarial, and security staff. in compensation for its participation, the university received about $750,000.
in the 1950s–1970s, caltech was the home of murray gell-mann and richard feynman, whose work was central to the establishment of the standard model of particle physics. feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful, unconventional character.
during lee a. dubridge's tenure as caltech's president (1946–1969), caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. dubridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed federal funding of science. new research fields flourished, including chemical biology, planetary science, nuclear astrophysics, and geochemistry. a 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby palomar mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.
caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of harold brown in 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class. the fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then.
caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics that there has been only one organized student protest in january 1968 outside the burbank studios of nbc, in response to rumors that nbc was to cancel "". in 1973, the students from dabney house protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase "impeach nixon". the following week, ross mccollum, president of the national oil company, wrote an open letter to dabney house stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to caltech. the dabney family, being republicans, disowned dabney house after hearing of the protest.
since 2000, the einstein papers project has been located at caltech. the project was established in 1986 to assemble, preserve, translate, and publish papers selected from the literary estate of albert einstein and from other collections.
in fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for caltech's undergraduate enrollment. in the same year, the institute concluded a six-year-long fund-raising campaign. the campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. nearly half of the funds went into the support of caltech programs and projects.
in 2010, caltech, in partnership with lawrence berkeley national laboratory and headed by professor nathan lewis, established a doe energy innovation hub aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight. this hub, the joint center for artificial photosynthesis, will receive up to $122 million in federal funding over five years.
since 2012, caltech began to offer classes through massive open online courses (moocs) under coursera, and from 2013, edx.
jean-lou chameau, the eighth president, announced on february 19, 2013, that he would be stepping down to accept the presidency at king abdullah university of science and technology. thomas f. rosenbaum was announced to be the ninth president of caltech on october 24, 2013, and his term began on july 1, 2014.
caltech's primary campus is located in pasadena, california, approximately northeast of downtown los angeles. it is within walking distance of old town pasadena and the pasadena playhouse district and therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for caltech students.
in 1917 hale hired architect bertram goodhue to produce a master plan for the campus. goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, dabney hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and hale's educational philosophy. goodhue's designs for caltech were also influenced by the traditional spanish mission architecture of southern california.
during the 1960s, caltech underwent considerable expansion, in part due to the philanthropy of alumnus arnold o. beckman. in 1953, beckman was asked to join the caltech board of trustees. in 1964, he became its chairman. over the next few years, as caltech's president emeritus david baltimore describes it, arnold beckman and his wife mabel "shaped the destiny of caltech".
in 1971 a magnitude-6.6 earthquake in san fernando caused some damage to the caltech campus. engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the institute—throop hall and the goodhue-designed culbertson auditorium—had cracked.
new additions to the campus include the cahill center for astronomy and astrophysics and the walter and leonore annenberg center for information science and technology, which opened in 2009, and the warren and katherine schlinger laboratory for chemistry and chemical engineering followed in march 2010. the institute also concluded an upgrading of the south houses in 2006. in late 2010, caltech completed a 1.3 mw solar array projected to produce approximately 1.6 gwh in 2011.
caltech is incorporated as a non-profit corporation and is governed by a privately appointed 46-member board of trustees who serve five-year terms of office and retire at the age of 72. the current board is chaired by david l. lee, co-founder of global crossing ltd. the trustees elect a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the institute and administer the affairs on the institute on behalf of the board, a provost who serves as the chief academic officer of the institute below the president, and ten other vice presidential and other senior positions. former georgia tech provost jean-lou chameau became the eighth president of caltech on september 1, 2006, replacing david baltimore who had served since 1997. chameau's compensation for 2008–2009 totaled $799,472. chameau served until june 30, 2013. thomas f. rosenbaum was announced to be the ninth president of caltech on october 24, 2013, and his term began on july 1, 2014. caltech's endowment is governed by a permanent trustee committee and administered by an investment office.
the institute is organized into six primary academic divisions: biology and biological engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, engineering and applied science, geological and planetary sciences, humanities and social sciences, and physics, mathematics, and astronomy. the voting faculty of caltech include all professors, instructors, research associates and fellows, and the university librarian. faculty are responsible for establishing admission requirements, academic standards, and curricula. the faculty board is the faculty's representative body and consists of 18 elected faculty representatives as well as other senior administration officials. full-time professors are expected to teach classes, conduct research, advise students, and perform administrative work such as serving on committees.
founded in 1930s, the jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) is a federally funded research and development center (ffrdc) owned by nasa and operated as a division of caltech through a contract between nasa and caltech. in 2008, jpl spent over $1.6 billion on research and development and employed over 5,000 project-related and support employees. the jpl director also serves as a caltech vice president and is responsible to the president of the institute for the management of the laboratory.
caltech is a small four-year, highly residential research university with a slight majority in graduate programs. the institute has been accredited by the western association of schools and colleges since 1949. caltech is on the quarter system: the fall term starts in late september and ends before christmas, the second term starts after new years day and ends in mid-march, and the third term starts in late march or early april and ends in early june.
in 2016, "u.s. news & world report" ranked caltech as tied for the 10th in the united states in their 2016 national rankings, with the graduate programs in chemistry and earth sciences ranked first in the nation. the "academic ranking of world universities" (arwu), ranked caltech 8th in the world and 6th in the u.s. in 2016.
in 2014 the"the daily beast" ranked caltech 12th nationally its guide to best colleges. that same year "money magazine" ranked caltech 10th nationally.
in 2010, the united states national research council released its latest "assessment of research doctorate programs", and, 23 of the 24 graduate programs of caltech were ranked within the top four programs in the nation for small sized universities.
caltech was ranked 1st internationally between 2011 and 2016 by the "times higher education world university rankings". caltech was ranked as the best university in the world in two categories: engineering & technology and physical sciences. it was also found to have the highest faculty citation rate in the world.
for the class of 2022 (enrolled fall 2018), caltech received 8208 applications and accepted 6.6% of applicants; 231 enrolled. the class included 46% women and 54% men. 25% were of underrepresented ancestry, and 8% were foreign students.
admission to caltech is extremely rigorous and requires the highest test scores in the nation.
the middle 50% range of sat scores for enrolled freshmen for the class of 2022 were 740–780 for evidence-based reading and writing and 790–800 for math, and 1520–1570 total.
the middle 50% range act composite score was 35–36.
the sat math level 2 middle 50% range was 800–800.
the middle 50% range for the sat physics subject test was 770–800; sat chemistry subject test was 780–800;
sat biology subject tests was 770–800
undergraduate tuition for the 2013–2014 school year was $39,990 and total annual costs were estimated to be $58,755. in 2012–2013, caltech awarded $17.1 million in need-based aid, $438k in non-need-based aid, and $2.51 million in self-help support to enrolled undergraduate students. the average financial aid package of all students eligible for aid was $38,756 and students graduated with an average debt of $15,090.
the full-time, four-year undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence. caltech offers 24 majors (called "options") and six minors across all six academic divisions. caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in applied physics, biochemistry, bioengineering, computation and neural systems, control and dynamical systems, environmental science and engineering, geobiology and astrobiology, geochemistry, and planetary astronomy. the most popular options are chemical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and physics.
prior to the entering class of 2013, caltech required students to take a core curriculum of five terms of mathematics, five terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, two terms of lab courses, one term of scientific communication, three terms of physical education, and 12 terms of humanities and social science. since 2013, only three terms each of mathematics and physics have been required by the institute, with the remaining two terms each required by certain options.
a typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition. approximately 20 percent of students double-major. this is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged, it is still possible.
first-year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math, physics, chemistry, and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a pass/fail basis. there is little competition; collaboration on homework is encouraged and the honor system encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules. caltech offers co-operative programs with other schools, such as the pasadena art center college of design and occidental college.
according to a payscale study, caltech graduates earn a median early career salary of $83,400 and $143,100 mid-career, placing them in the top 5 among graduates of us colleges and universities. the average net return on investment over a period of 20 years is $887,000, the tenth-highest among us colleges.
caltech offers army and air force rotc in cooperation with the university of southern california.
the graduate instructional programs emphasize doctoral studies and are dominated by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. the institute offers graduate degree programs for the master of science, engineer's degree, doctor of philosophy, bs/ms and md/phd, with the majority of students in the phd program. the most popular options are chemistry, physics, biology, electrical engineering and chemical engineering. applicants for graduate studies are required to take the gre. gre subject scores are either required or strongly recommended by several options. a joint program between caltech and the keck school of medicine of the university of southern california, and the ucla david geffen school of medicine grants md/phd degrees. students in this program do their preclinical and clinical work at usc or ucla, and their phd work with any member of the caltech faculty, including the biology, chemistry, and engineering and applied sciences divisions. the md degree would be from usc or ucla and the phd would be awarded from caltech.
the research facilities at caltech are available to graduate students, but there are opportunities for students to work in facilities of other universities, research centers as well as private industries. the graduate student to faculty ratio is 4:1.
approximately 99 percent of doctoral students have full financial support. financial support for graduate students comes in the form of fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships or a combination of fellowship and assistantship support.
graduate students are bound by the honor code, as are the undergraduates, and the graduate honor council oversees any violations of the code.
caltech was elected to the association of american universities in 1934 and remains a research university with "very high" research activity, primarily in stem fields. caltech manages research expenditures of $270 million annually, 66th among all universities in the u.s. and 17th among private institutions without medical schools for 2008. the largest federal agencies contributing to research are nasa, national science foundation, department of health and human services, department of defense, and department of energy. caltech received $144 million in federal funding for the physical sciences, $40.8 million for the life sciences, $33.5 million for engineering, $14.4 million for environmental sciences, $7.16 million for computer sciences, and $1.97 million for mathematical sciences in 2008.
the institute was awarded an all-time high funding of $357 million in 2009. active funding from the national science foundation directorate of mathematical and physical science (mps) for caltech stands at $343 million , the highest for any educational institution in the nation, and higher than the total funds allocated to any state except california and new york.
in 2005, caltech had dedicated to research: to physical sciences, to engineering, and to biological sciences.
in addition to managing jpl, caltech also operates the palomar observatory in san diego county, the owens valley radio observatory in bishop, california, the submillimeter observatory and w. m. keck observatory at the mauna kea observatory, the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory at livingston, louisiana and richland, washington, and kerckhoff marine laboratory in corona del mar, california. the institute launched the kavli nanoscience institute at caltech in 2006, the keck institute for space studies in 2008, and is also the current home for the einstein papers project. the spitzer science center (ssc), part of the infrared processing and analysis center located on the caltech campus, is the data analysis and community support center for nasa's spitzer space telescope.
caltech partnered with ucla to establish a joint center for translational medicine (ucla-caltech jctm), which conducts experimental research into clinical applications, including the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer.
caltech operates several tccon stations as part of an international collaborative effort of measuring greenhouse gases globally. one station is on campus.
undergraduates at caltech are also encouraged to participate in research. about 80% of the class of 2010 did research through the annual summer undergraduate research fellowships (surf) program at least once during their stay, and many continued during the school year. students write and submit surf proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors, and about 70 percent of applicants are awarded surfs. the program is open to both caltech and non-caltech undergraduate students. it serves as preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a phd of all the major universities.
the licensing and transferring of technology to the commercial sector is managed by the office of technology transfer (ott). ott protects and manages the intellectual property developed by faculty members, students, other researchers, and jpl technologists. caltech receives more invention disclosures per faculty member than any other university in the nation. , 1891 patents were granted to caltech researchers since 1969.
during the early 20th century, a caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the undergraduate housing system from regular fraternities to a house system. four south houses (or "hovses") were built: blacker house, dabney house, fleming house and ricketts house. in the 1960s, three north houses were built: lloyd house, page house, and ruddock house, and during the 1990s, avery house. the four south houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006. all first year students live in the house system and 95% of undergraduates remain affiliated with a house.
caltech has athletic teams in baseball, men's and women's basketball, cross country, fencing, men's and women's soccer, swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, track and field, women's volleyball, and men's and women's water polo. caltech's mascot is the beaver, a homage to nature's engineer. its teams (with the exception of the fencing team) play in the southern california intercollegiate athletic conference, which caltech co-founded in 1915. the fencing team competes in the ncaa's division i, facing teams from ucla, usc, ucsd, and stanford, among others.
on january 6, 2007, the beavers' men's basketball team snapped a 207-game losing streak to division iii schools, beating bard college 81–52. it was their first division iii victory since 1996.
until their win over occidental on february 22, 2011 the team had not won a game in conference play since 1985. ryan elmquist's free throw with 3.3 seconds in regulation gave the beavers the victory. the documentary film "quantum hoops" concerns the events of the beavers' 2005–06 season.
on january 13, 2007, the caltech women's basketball team snapped a 50-game losing streak, defeating the pomona–pitzer sagehens 55–53. the women's program, which entered the sciac in 2002, garnered their first conference win. on the bench as honorary coach for the evening was dr. robert grubbs, 2005 nobel laureate in chemistry. the team went on to beat whittier college on february 10, for its second sciac win, and placed its first member on the all conference team. the 2006–2007 season is the most successful season in the history of the program.
in 2007, 2008, and 2009, the women's table tennis team (a club team) competed in nationals. the women's ultimate club team, known as "snatch", has also been very successful in recent years, ranking 44 of over 200 college teams in the ultimate player's association.
on february 2, 2013, the caltech baseball team ended a 228-game losing streak, the team's first win in nearly 10 years.
the track and field team plays at the south athletic field in tournament park, the site of the first rose bowl game.
the school also sponsored a football team prior to 1976, which played part of its home schedule at the rose bowl, or, as caltech students put it, "to the largest number of empty seats in the nation".
the caltech/occidental college orchestra is a full seventy-piece orchestra composed of students, faculty, and staff at caltech and nearby occidental college. the orchestra gives three pairs of concerts annually, at both caltech and occidental college. there are also two caltech jazz bands and a concert band. for vocal music, caltech has a mixed voice glee club and a smaller chamber singer group. the theater program at caltech is known as tacit, or theater arts at the california institute of technology. there are two to three plays organized by tacit per year, and they were involved in the production of the , released in 2011.
every halloween, dabney house conducts the infamous "millikan pumpkin-drop experiment" from the top of millikan library, the highest point on campus. according to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in liquid nitrogen and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a triboluminescent spark. this yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. the title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous millikan oil-drop experiment which measured "e", the elemental unit of electrical charge.
on ditch day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. each group of seniors designs a "stack" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. the faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on ditch day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.
another long-standing tradition is the playing of wagner's "ride of the valkyries" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. the playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of "the ring cycle"), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed.
caltech students have been known for the many pranks (also known as "rfs").
the two most famous in recent history are the changing of the hollywood sign to read "caltech", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read caltech 38, mit 9 during the 1984 rose bowl game. but the most famous of all occurred during the 1961 rose bowl game, where caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display "caltech", and several other "unintended" messages. this event is now referred to as the great rose bowl hoax.
in recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by tom mannion, caltech's assistant vp for student affairs and campus life. "the grand old days of pranking have gone away at caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back," reported the "boston globe".
in december 2011, caltech students went to new york and pulled a prank on manhattan's greenwich village. the prank involved making the cube sculpture look like the aperture science weighted companion cube from the video game "portal".
caltech pranks have been documented in three legends of caltech books, the most recent of which was edited by alumni autumn looijen '99 and mason porter '98 and published in may 2007.
in 2005, a group of caltech students pulled a string of pranks during mit's campus preview weekend for admitted students. these include covering up the word massachusetts in the "massachusetts institute of technology" engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read "that other institute of technology". a group of mit hackers responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read "the only institute of technology." caltech students also passed out t-shirts to mit's incoming freshman class that had mit written on the front and "...because not everyone can go to caltech" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.
mit retaliated in april 2006, when students posing as the howe & ser (howitzer) moving company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton fleming house cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in cambridge, massachusetts for their 2006 campus preview weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby harvey mudd college in 1986. thirty members of fleming house traveled to mit and reclaimed their cannon on april 10, 2006.
on april 13, 2007 (friday the 13th), a group of students from "the california tech", caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of "the tech", mit's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their campus preview weekend. articles included "mit invents the interweb", "architects deem campus 'unfortunate'", and "infinite corridor not actually infinite".
in december 2009, some caltech students declared that mit had been sold and had become the caltech east campus. a "sold" banner was hung on front of the mit dome building and a "welcome to caltech east: school of the humanities" banner over the massachusetts avenue entrance. newspapers and t-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the "curriculum change."
in september 2010, mit students attempted to put a tardis, the time machine from the bbc's "doctor who", onto a roof. caught in midact, the prank was aborted. in january 2011, caltech students in conjunction with mit students helped put the tardis on top of baxter. caltech students then moved the tardis to uc berkeley and stanford.
in april 2014, during mit's campus preview weekend, a group of caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the mit logo on the front and the words "the institute of technology" on the back. when heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read "caltech the hotter institute of technology." identical mugs continue to be sold at the caltech campus store.
life in the caltech community is governed by the honor code, which simply states: "no member of the caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the caltech community." this is enforced by a board of control, which consists of undergraduate students, and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the graduate honor council.
the honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. for example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.
through the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. although both policies are presented in the honor system handbook given to new members of the caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community. in recent years, the student affairs office has also become fond of pursuing investigations independently of the board of control and conduct review committee, an implicit violation of both the honor code and written disciplinary policy that has contributed to further erosion of trust between some parts of the undergraduate community and the administration.
, caltech has 38 nobel laureates to its name awarded to 22 alumni, which includes 5 caltech professors who are also alumni (carl d. anderson, linus pauling, william a. fowler, edward b. lewis, and kip thorne), and 15 non-alumni professors. the total number of nobel prizes is 39 because pauling received prizes in both chemistry and peace. the official nobel prize count is 48 affiliates in total when including temporary academic staff such as visiting professors and postdoctoral scholars. seven faculty and alumni have received a crafoord prize from the royal swedish academy of sciences, while 58 have been awarded the u.s. national medal of science, and 13 have received the national medal of technology. one alumnus, stanislav smirnov, won the fields medal in 2010. other distinguished researchers have been affiliated with caltech as postdoctoral scholars (for example, barbara mcclintock, james d. watson, sheldon glashow and john gurdon) or visiting professors (for example, albert einstein, stephen hawking and edward witten).
caltech enrolled 948 undergraduate students and 1,285 graduate students for the 2018–2019 school year. women made up 45% of the undergraduate and 29% of the graduate student body. the racial demographics of the school substantially differ from those of the nation as a whole.
the four-year graduation rate is 79% and the six-year rate is 92%, which is low compared to most leading u.s. universities, but substantially higher than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. students majoring in stem fields traditionally have graduation rates below 70%.
richard feynman was among the most well-known physicists associated with caltech, having published the "feynman lectures on physics", an undergraduate physics text, and a few other popular science texts such as "six easy pieces" for the general audience. the promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his nobel-winning work in quantum electrodynamics was already very established in the scientific community. murray gell-mann, a nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of hadrons and went on to postulate the existence of quarks, which is currently accepted as part of the standard model. long-time caltech president robert andrews millikan was the first to calculate the charge of the electron with his well-known oil-drop experiment, while richard chace tolman is remembered for his contributions to cosmology and statistical mechanics. 2004 nobel prize in physics winner h. david politzer is a current professor at caltech, as is astrophysicist and author kip thorne and eminent mathematician barry simon. linus pauling pioneered quantum chemistry and molecular biology, and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. seismologist charles richter, also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the richter magnitude scale for measuring the power of earthquakes. one of the founders of the geochemistry department, clair patterson was the first to accurately determine the age of the earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. in engineering, theodore von kármán made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. a repeating pattern of swirling vortices is named after him, the von kármán vortex street. participants in von kármán's galcit project included frank malina, who helped develop the wac corporal which was the first u.s. rocket to reach the edge of space, jack parsons, a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and qian xuesen, who was dubbed the "father of chinese rocketry". more recently, michael brown, a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many trans-neptunian objects, most notably the dwarf planet eris, which prompted the international astronomical union to redefine the term "planet".
david baltimore, the robert a. millikan professor of biology, and alice huang, senior faculty associate in biology, have served as the president of aaas from 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 respectively.
33% of the faculty are members of the national academy of science or engineering and/or fellows of the american academy of arts and sciences. this is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution rockefeller university.
the average salary for assistant professors at caltech is $111,300, associate professors $121,300, and full professors $172,800. caltech faculty are active in applied physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biology, biochemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, geology, mechanical engineering and physics.
there are 22,930 total living alumni in the u.s. and around the world. twenty-two alumni and 15 non-alumni faculty have won the nobel prize. the turing award, the "nobel prize of computer science", has been awarded to six alumni, and one has won the fields medal.
alumni have participated in scientific research. some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules. nobel laureate carl d. anderson (bs 1927, phd 1930) proved the existence of positrons and muons, nobel laureate edwin mcmillan (bs 1928, ms 1929) synthesized the first transuranium element, nobel laureate leo james rainwater (bs 1939) investigated the non-spherical shapes of atomic nuclei, and nobel laureate douglas d. osheroff (bs 1967) studied the superfluid nature of helium-3. donald knuth (phd 1963), the "father" of the analysis of algorithms, wrote "the art of computer programming" and created the tex computer typesetting system, which is commonly used in the scientific community. narendra karmarkar (ms 1979) is known for the interior point method, a polynomial algorithm for linear programming known as karmarkar's algorithm.
other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe. c. gordon fullerton (bs 1957, ms 1958) piloted the third space shuttle mission. astronaut (and later, united states senator) harrison schmitt (bs 1957) was the only geologist to have ever walked on the surface of the moon. astronomer eugene merle shoemaker (bs 1947, ms 1948) co-discovered comet shoemaker-levy 9 (a comet which crashed into the planet jupiter) and was the first person buried on the moon (by having his ashes crashed into the moon). astronomer george o. abell (bs 1951, ms 1952, phd 1957) while a grad student at cal tech participated in the national geographic society-palomar sky survey. this ultimately resulted in the publication of the "abell catalogue of clusters of galaxies," the definitive work in the field.
undergraduate alumni founded, or co-founded, companies such as lcd manufacturer varitronix, hotmail, compaq, and mathworks (which created matlab), while graduate students founded, or co-founded, companies such as intel, trw, and the non-profit educational organization, the exploratorium.
arnold beckman (phd 1928) invented the ph meter and commercialized it with the founding of beckman instruments. his success with that company enabled him to provide seed funding for william shockley (bs 1932), who had co-invented semiconductor transistors and wanted to commercialize them. shockley became the founding director of the shockley semiconductor laboratory division of beckman instruments. shockley had previously worked at bell labs, whose first president was another alumnus, frank jewett (bs 1898). because his aging mother lived in palo alto, california, shockley established his laboratory near her in mountain view, california. shockley was a co-recipient of the nobel prize in physics in 1956, but his aggressive management style and odd personality at the shockley lab became unbearable. in late 1957, eight of his researchers resigned and with support from sherman fairchild formed fairchild semiconductor. among the "traitorous eight" was gordon e. moore (phd 1954), who later left fairchild to co-found intel. other offspring companies of fairchild semiconductor include national semiconductor and advanced micro devices, which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area. shockley's decision to use silicon – instead of germanium – as the semiconductor material, coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area, gave rise to the term "silicon valley" to describe that geographic region surrounding palo alto.
caltech alumni also held public offices, with mustafa a.g. abushagur (phd 1984) the deputy prime minister of libya and prime minister-elect of libya, james fletcher (phd 1948) the 4th and 7th administrator of nasa, steven koonin (phd 1972) the undersecretary of energy for science, and regina dugan (phd 1993) the 19th director of darpa. the 20th director for darpa, arati prabhakar, is also a caltech alumna (phd 1984). arvind virmani is a former chief economic adviser to the government of india. in 2013, president obama announced the nomination of france cordova (phd 1979) as the director of the national science foundation and ellen williams (phd 1982) as the director for arpa-e.
over the years caltech has actively promoted the commercialization of technologies developed within its walls. through its office of technology transfer & corporate partnerships, scientific breakthroughs have led to the transfer of numerous technologies in a wide variety of scientific-related fields such as photovoltaic, radio-frequency identification (rfid), semiconductors, hyperspectral imaging, electronic devices, protein design, solid state amplifiers and many more. companies such as contour energy systems, impinj, fulcrum microsystems, nanosys, inc., photon etc., xencor, and wavestream wireless have emerged from caltech.
caltech has appeared in many works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. as with mit, a caltech reference is often used to establish a character's high level of intelligence or a technical background; for example, in the novel "contact" by carl sagan, eleanor arroway holds a ph.d. in radio astronomy from the school. in the marvel comics mainstream continuity, bruce banner holds a ph.d. in nuclear physics from the institute. on television, all four male lead characters and one female lead character in the sitcom "the big bang theory" are employed at the institute. caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, for the california institute of science of "numb3rs". on film, the pacific tech of "the war of the worlds" and "real genius" is based on caltech.

carlo osvaldo goldoni (; 25 february 1707 – 6 february 1793) was an italian playwright and librettist from the republic of venice. his works include some of italy's most famous and best-loved plays. audiences have admired the plays of goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. his plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging middle classes. though he wrote in french and italian, his plays make rich use of the venetian language, regional vernacular, and colloquialisms. goldoni also wrote under the pen name and title "polisseno fegeio, pastor arcade," which he claimed in his memoirs the "arcadians of rome" bestowed on him.
one of his best known works is the comic play "servant of two masters", which has been translated and adapted internationally numerous times. in 1966 it was adapted into an opera buffa by the american composer vittorio giannini. in 2011, richard bean adapted the play for the national theatre of great britain as "one man, two guvnors". its popularity led to a transfer to the west end and in 2012 to broadway.
there is an abundance of autobiographical information on goldoni, most of which comes from the introductions to his plays and from his "memoirs". however, these memoirs are known to contain many errors of fact, especially about his earlier years.
in these memoirs, he paints himself as a born comedian, careless, light-hearted and with a happy temperament, proof against all strokes of fate, yet thoroughly respectable and honorable.
goldoni was born in venice in 1707, the son of margherita and giulio goldoni. in his memoirs, goldoni describes his father as a physician, and claims that he was introduced to theatre by his grandfather carlo alessandro goldoni. in reality, it seems that giulio was an apothecary; as for the grandfather, he had died four years before carlo's birth. in any case, goldoni was deeply interested in theatre from his earliest years, and all attempts to direct his activity into other channels were of no avail; his toys were puppets, and his books, plays.
his father placed him under the care of the philosopher caldini at rimini but the youth soon ran away with a company of strolling players and returned to venice. in 1723 his father matriculated him into the stern collegio ghislieri in pavia, which imposed the tonsure and monastic habits on its students. however, he relates in his "memoirs" that a considerable part of his time was spent in reading greek and latin comedies. he had already begun writing at this time and, in his third year, he composed a libellous poem ("il colosso") in which he ridiculed the daughters of certain pavian families. as a result of that incident (and/or of a visit paid with some schoolmates to a local brothel) he was expelled from the school and had to leave the city (1725). he studied law at udine, and eventually took his degree at university of modena. he was employed as a law clerk at chioggia and feltre, after which he returned to his native city and began practicing.
educated as a lawyer, and holding lucrative positions as secretary and counsellor, he seemed, indeed, at one time to have settled down to the practice of law, but following an unexpected summons to venice, after an absence of several years, he changed his career, and thenceforth he devoted himself to writing plays and managing theatres. his father died in 1731. in 1732, to avoid an unwanted marriage, he left the town for milan and then for verona where the theatre manager giuseppe imer helped him on his way to becoming a comical poet as well as introducing him to his future wife, nicoletta conio. goldoni returned with her to venice, where he stayed until 1743.
goldoni entered the italian theatre scene with a tragedy, "amalasunta", produced in milan. the play was a critical and financial failure.
submitting it to count prata, director of the opera, he was told that his piece "was composed with due regard for the rules of aristotle and horace, but not according to those laid down for the italian drama." "in france", continued the count, "you can try to please the public, but here in italy it is the actors and actresses whom you must consult, as well as the composer of the music and the stage decorators. everything must be done according to a certain form which i will explain to you."
goldoni thanked his critic, went back to his inn and ordered a fire, into which he threw the manuscript of his "amalasunta".
his next play, "belisario", written in 1734, was more successful, though of its success he afterward professed himself ashamed.
during this period he also wrote librettos for opera seria and served for a time as literary director of the san giovanni grisostomo, venice's most distinguished opera house.
he wrote other tragedies for a time, but he was not long in discovering that his bent was for comedy. he had come to realize that the italian stage needed reforming; adopting molière as his model, he went to work in earnest and in 1738 produced his first real comedy, "l'uomo di mondo" ("the man of the world"). during his many wanderings and adventures in italy, he was constantly at work and when, at livorno, he became acquainted with the manager medebac, he determined to pursue the profession of playwriting in order to make a living. he was employed by medebac to write plays for his theater in venice. he worked for other managers and produced during his stay in that city some of his most characteristic works. he also wrote "momolo cortesan" in 1738. by 1743, he had perfected his hybrid style of playwriting (combining the model of molière with the strengths of commedia dell'arte and his own wit and sincerity). this style was typified in "la donna di garbo", the first italian comedy of its kind.
after 1748, goldoni collaborated with the composer baldassare galuppi, making significant contributions to the new form of 'opera buffa'. galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of goldoni's librettos. as with his comedies, goldoni's "opera buffa" integrate elements of the commedia dell'arte with recognisable local and middle-class realities. his operatic works include two of the most successful musical comedies of the eighteenth century, "il filosofo di campagna" ("the country philosopher"), set by galuppi (1752) and "la buona figliuola" ("the good girl"), set by niccolò piccinni (1760).
in 1753, following his return from bologna he defected to the teatro san luca of the vendramin family where he performed most of his plays to 1762.
in 1757, he engaged in a bitter dispute with playwright carlo gozzi, which left him utterly disgusted with the tastes of his countrymen; so much so that in 1761 he moved to paris, where he received a position at court and was put in charge of the theatre italien. he spent the rest of his life in france, composing most of his plays in french and writing his memoirs in that language.
among the plays which he wrote in french, the most successful was "le bourru bienfaisant", dedicated to the marie adélaïde, a daughter of louis xv and aunt to the dauphin, the future louis xvi of france. it premiered on 4 february 1771, almost nine months after the dauphin's marriage to marie antoinette. goldoni enjoyed considerable popularity in france; in 1769, when he retired to versailles, the king gave him a pension. he lost this pension after the french revolution. the convention eventually voted to restore his pension the day after his death. it was restored to his widow, at the pleading of the poet andré chénier; "she is old", he urged, "she is seventy-six, and her husband has left her no heritage save his illustrious name, his virtues and his poverty."
in his "memoirs" goldoni amply discusses the state of italian comedy when he began writing. at that time, italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the commedia dell'arte, or improvised comedy. goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviors. he rightly maintained that italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before.
his works are a lasting monument to the changes that he initiated: a dramatic revolution that had been attempted but not achieved before. goldoni's importance lay in providing good examples rather than precepts. goldoni says that he took for his models the plays of molière and that whenever a piece of his own succeeded he whispered to himself: "good, but not yet molière." goldoni's plays are gentler and more optimistic in tone than molière's.
it was this very success that was the object of harsh critiques by carlo gozzi, who accused goldoni of having deprived the italian theatre of the charms of poetry and imagination. the great success of gozzi's fairy dramas so irritated goldoni that it led to his self-exile to france.
goldoni gave to his country a classical form, which, though it has since been cultivated, has yet to be cultivated by a master.
goldoni's plays that were written while he was still in italy ignore religious and ecclesiastical subjects. this may be surprising, considering his staunch catholic upbringing. no thoughts are expressed about death or repentance in his memoirs or in his comedies. after his move to france, his position became clearer, as his plays took on a clear anti-clerical tone and often satirized the hypocrisy of monks and of the church.
goldoni was inspired by his love of humanity and the admiration he had for his fellow men. he wrote, and was obsessed with, the relationships that humans establish with one another, their cities and homes, the humanist movement, and the study of philosophy. the moral and civil values that goldoni promotes in his plays are those of rationality, civility, humanism, the importance of the rising middle-class, a progressive stance to state affairs, honor and honesty. goldoni had a dislike for arrogance, intolerance and the abuse of power.
goldoni's main characters are no abstract examples of human virtue, nor monstrous examples of human vice. they occupy the middle ground of human temperament. goldoni maintains an acute sensibility for the differences in social classes between his characters as well as environmental and generational changes. goldoni pokes fun at the arrogant nobility and the pauper who lacks dignity.
as in other theatrical works of the time and place, the characters in goldoni's italian comedies spoke originally either the literary tuscan variety (which became modern italian) or the venetian dialect, depending on their station in life. however, in some printed editions of his plays he often turned the venetian texts into tuscan, too.
the following is a small sampling of goldoni's enormous output.

in probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a real-valued random variable formula_1, or just distribution function of formula_1, evaluated at formula_3, is the probability that formula_1 will take a value less than or equal to formula_3.
in the case of a continuous distribution, it gives the area under the probability density function from minus infinity to formula_3, and is a logistic distribution. cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of multivariate random variables.
the cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable formula_1 is the function given by
where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable formula_1 takes on a value less than or
equal to formula_3. the probability that formula_1 lies in the semi-closed interval formula_11, where formula_12, is therefore
in the definition above, the "less than or equal to" sign, "≤", is a convention, not a universally used one (e.g. hungarian literature uses "<"), but is important for discrete distributions. the proper use of tables of the binomial and poisson distributions depends upon this convention. moreover, important formulas like paul lévy's inversion formula for the characteristic function also rely on the "less than or equal" formulation.
if treating several random variables formula_13 etc. the corresponding letters are used as subscripts while, if treating only one, the subscript is usually omitted. it is conventional to use a capital formula_14 for a cumulative distribution function, in contrast to the lower-case formula_15 used for probability density functions and probability mass functions. this applies when discussing general distributions: some specific distributions have their own conventional notation, for example the normal distribution.
the cdf of a continuous random variable formula_1 can be expressed as the integral of its probability density function formula_17 as follows:
in the case of a random variable formula_1 which has distribution having a discrete component at a value formula_20,
if formula_22 is continuous at formula_20, this equals zero and there is no discrete component at formula_20.
every cumulative distribution function formula_22 is non-decreasing and right-continuous, which makes it a càdlàg function. furthermore,
every function with these four properties is a cdf, i.e., for every such function, a random variable can be defined such that the function is the cumulative distribution function of that random variable.
if formula_1 is a purely discrete random variable, then it attains values formula_28 with probability formula_29, and the cdf of formula_1 will be discontinuous at the points formula_31 and constant in between:
if the cdf formula_22 of a real valued random variable formula_1 is continuous, then formula_1 is a continuous random variable; if furthermore formula_22 is absolutely continuous, then there exists a lebesgue-integrable function formula_37 such that
for all real numbers formula_39 and formula_20. the function formula_17 is equal to the derivative of formula_22 almost everywhere, and it is called the probability density function of the distribution of formula_1.
as an example, suppose formula_1 is uniformly distributed on the unit interval formula_45.
then the cdf of formula_1 is given by
suppose instead that formula_1 takes only the discrete values 0 and 1, with equal probability.
then the cdf of formula_1 is given by
sometimes, it is useful to study the opposite question and ask how often the random variable is "above" a particular level. this is called the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) or simply the tail distribution or exceedance, and is defined as
this has applications in statistical hypothesis testing, for example, because the one-sided p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic "at least" as extreme as the one observed. thus, provided that the test statistic, "t", has a continuous distribution, the one-sided p-value is simply given by the ccdf: for an observed value formula_52 of the test statistic
in survival analysis, formula_54 is called the survival function and denoted formula_55, while the term "reliability function" is common in engineering.
while the plot of a cumulative distribution often has an s-like shape, an alternative illustration is the folded cumulative distribution or mountain plot, which folds the top half of the graph over,
thus using two scales, one for the upslope and another for the downslope. this form of illustration emphasises the median and dispersion (specifically, the mean absolute deviation from the median) of the distribution or of the empirical results.
if the cdf "f" is strictly increasing and continuous then formula_66 is the unique real number formula_67 such that formula_68. in such a case, this defines the inverse distribution function or quantile function.
some distributions do not have a unique inverse (for example in the case where formula_69 for all <math>a<x, causing formula_22 to be constant). this problem can be solved by defining, for formula_71, the generalized inverse distribution function:
some useful properties of the inverse cdf (which are also preserved in the definition of the generalized inverse distribution function) are:
the inverse of the cdf can be used to translate results obtained for the uniform distribution to other distributions.
when dealing simultaneously with more than one random variable the joint cumulative distribution function can also be defined. for example, for a pair of random variables formula_92, the joint cdf formula_93 is given by
where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable formula_1 takes on a value less than or
equal to formula_3 and that formula_81 takes on a value less than or
equal to formula_97.
for formula_98 random variables formula_99, the joint cdf formula_100 is given by
interpreting the formula_98 random variables as a random vector formula_102 yields a shorter notation:
every multivariate cdf is:
the generalization of the cumulative distribution function from real to complex random variables is not obvious because expressions of the form formula_106 make no sense. however expressions of the form formula_107 make sense. therefore, we define the cumulative distribution of a complex random variables via the joint distribution of their real and imaginary parts:
generalization of yields
as definition for the cds of a complex random vector formula_110.
the concept of the cumulative distribution function makes an explicit appearance in statistical analysis in two (similar) ways. cumulative frequency analysis is the analysis of the frequency of occurrence of values of a phenomenon less than a reference value. the empirical distribution function is a formal direct estimate of the cumulative distribution function for which simple statistical properties can be derived and which can form the basis of various statistical hypothesis tests. such tests can assess whether there is evidence against a sample of data having arisen from a given distribution, or evidence against two samples of data having arisen from the same (unknown) population distribution.
the kolmogorov–smirnov test is based on cumulative distribution functions and can be used to test to see whether two empirical distributions are different or whether an empirical distribution is different from an ideal distribution. the closely related kuiper's test is useful if the domain of the distribution is cyclic as in day of the week. for instance kuiper's test might be used to see if the number of tornadoes varies during the year or if sales of a product vary by day of the week or day of the month.

in statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution. it may also be called a center or location of the distribution. colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called "averages." the term "central tendency" dates from the late 1920s.
the most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean, the median and the mode. a central tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. occasionally authors use central tendency to denote "the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value."
the central tendency of a distribution is typically contrasted with its "dispersion" or "variability"; dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions. analysis may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion.
the following may be applied to one-dimensional data. depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate to transform the data before calculating a central tendency. examples are squaring the values or taking logarithms. whether a transformation is appropriate and what it should be, depend heavily on the data being analyzed.
any of the above may be applied to each dimension of multi-dimensional data, but the results may not be invariant to rotations of the multi-dimensional space. in addition, there are the
several measures of central tendency can be characterized as solving a variational problem, in the sense of the calculus of variations, namely minimizing variation from the center. that is, given a measure of statistical dispersion, one asks for a measure of central tendency that minimizes variation: such that variation from the center is minimal among all choices of center. in a quip, "dispersion precedes location". this center may or may not be unique. in the sense of "l" spaces, the correspondence is:
the associated functions are called "p"-norms: respectively 0-"norm", 1-norm, 2-norm, and ∞-norm. the function corresponding to the "l" space is not a norm, and is thus often referred to in quotes: 0-"norm".
in equations, for a given (finite) data set "x", thought of as a vector formula_1, the dispersion about a point "c" is the "distance" from x to the constant vector formula_2 in the "p"-norm (normalized by the number of points "n"):
note that for formula_4 and formula_5 these functions are defined by taking limits, respectively as formula_6 and formula_7. for formula_4 the limiting values are formula_9 and formula_10 for formula_11, so the difference becomes simply equality, so the 0-norm counts the number of "unequal" points. for formula_5 the largest number dominates, and thus the ∞-norm is the maximum difference.
the mean ("l" center) and midrange ("l" center) are unique (when they exist), while the median ("l" center) and mode ("l" center) are not in general unique. this can be understood in terms of convexity of the associated functions (coercive functions).
the 2-norm and ∞-norm are strictly convex, and thus (by convex optimization) the minimizer is unique (if it exists), and exists for bounded distributions. thus standard deviation about the mean is lower than standard deviation about any other point, and the maximum deviation about the midrange is lower than the maximum deviation about any other point.
the 1-norm is not "strictly" convex, whereas strict convexity is needed to ensure uniqueness of the minimizer. correspondingly, the median (in this sense of minimizing) is not in general unique, and in fact any point between the two central points of a discrete distribution minimizes average absolute deviation.
the 0-"norm" is not convex (hence not a norm). correspondingly, the mode is not unique – for example, in a uniform distribution "any" point is the mode.
the notion of a "center" as minimizing variation can be generalized in information geometry as a distribution that minimizes divergence (a generalized distance) from a data set. the most common case is maximum likelihood estimation, where the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) maximizes likelihood (minimizes expected surprisal), which can be interpreted geometrically by using entropy to measure variation: the mle minimizes cross entropy (equivalently, relative entropy, kullback–leibler divergence).
a simple example of this is for the center of nominal data: instead of using the mode (the only single-valued "center"), one often uses the empirical measure (the frequency distribution divided by the sample size) as a "center". for example, given binary data, say heads or tails, if a data set consists of 2 heads and 1 tails, then the mode is "heads", but the empirical measure is 2/3 heads, 1/3 tails, which minimizes the cross-entropy (total surprisal) from the data set. this perspective is also used in regression analysis, where least squares finds the solution that minimizes the distances from it, and analogously in logistic regression, a maximum likelihood estimate minimizes the surprisal (information distance).
for unimodal distributions the following bounds are known and are sharp:
where "μ" is the mean, "ν" is the median, "θ" is the mode, and "σ" is the standard deviation.
for every distribution,

celebrity is the fame and public attention accorded by the mass media to individuals or groups or, occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc.) themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention. celebrity status is often associated with wealth (commonly referred to as "fame and fortune"), while fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.
successful careers in sports and entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status, while political leaders often become celebrities. people may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person.
athletes in ancient greece were welcomed home as heroes, had songs and poems written in their honor, and received free food and gifts from those seeking celebrity endorsement. ancient rome similarly lauded actors and notorious gladiators, and julius caesar appeared on a coin in his own lifetime (a departure from the usual depiction of battles and divine lineage).
in the early 12th century, thomas becket became famous following his murder. he was promoted by the christian church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. in a pattern often repeated, what started out as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to canterbury cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.
the cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the romantics in the 18th century, whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. the establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, london and paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. newspapers started including gossip columns and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.
the movie industry spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and with it the now familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting out as a medium. as paul mcdonald states in "the star system: hollywood's production of popular identities", "in the first decade of the twentieth century, american film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries." public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of movie stars and their private lives became headline news: for example, in hollywood the marriages of elizabeth taylor and in bollywood the affairs of raj kapoor in the 1950s.
the second half of the century saw television and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by elvis presley and the beatles, respectively. john lennon's highly controversial 1966 quote: "we're more popular than jesus now," which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with christ, gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and news readers. however, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as oprah winfrey, jerry springer, or david frost could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.
in the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. in most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.
cultures and regions with a significant population may have their own independent celebrity systems, with distinct hierarchies. for example, the canadian province of quebec, which is french-speaking, has its own system of french-speaking television, movie and music celebrities. a person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer lara fabian is widely known in the french-speaking world, but only had a couple of "billboard" hits in the u.s., whereas the francophone canadian singer celine dion is well known in both the french-speaking world and in the united states.
regions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, or religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as quebec or wales. regional radio personalities, newscasters, politicians or community leaders may be local or regional celebrities.
in politics, certain politicians are recognizable to many people, usually the head of state and the prime minister. yet only heads of state who play a major role in international politics have a good chance of becoming famous outside their country's borders, since they are constantly featured in mass media. the president of the united states, for instance, is famous by name and face to millions of people around the world. since world war ii the u.s. presidential elections are followed closely all across the globe, making the elected candidate instantly world-famous as a result. in contrast, both the pope and the dalai lama are far more famous under their official title than under their actual names. usually when politicians leave active politics their recognizability tends to diminish among general audiences, as other politicians replace them in their official political functions. certain politicians, however, are still famous today, even decades or centuries after they were in power. they owe their fame to historical deeds which are kept in memory in history classes, for instance people like julius caesar, genghis khan, napoleon bonaparte, abraham lincoln and mao zedong. scandal can also unwillingly make certain politicians famous, even among those who are not particularly interested in politics.
english-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the "a-list" or state that a certain actor belongs to the "b-list", the latter being a disparaging context. these informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. however, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. a brazilian actor might be a b-list action film actor in the u.s., but an a-list star in portugal.
some elements are associated with fame, such as appearing on the cover of "time", being spoofed in "mad", having a wax statue in "madame tussauds", or receiving a star on the "hollywood walk of fame."
certain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they assembled their fame. if one has to name a famous boxer, they are more likely to name muhammad ali or mike tyson, since their fame expanded beyond the sport itself and appealed not just to followers of the sport but also outsiders to the area. pablo picasso's style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that harry houdini was an illusionist, tiger woods a golfer, richard branson and bill gates are entrepreneurs, albert einstein a scientist; mozart and beethoven classical composers; luciano pavarotti an opera singer, bruce lee a martial artist, william shakespeare a playwright, walt disney an animator and yuri gagarin and neil armstrong astronauts though they did not all excel in the same area.
criminals can also become world-famous if the media cover their crimes, arrest, trial and possible punishment extensively and/or if the crime itself is sensational enough. assassins of high-profile celebrities can become famous, like brutus who is remembered for murdering julius caesar. people who commit extremely gruesome crimes can also achieve infamy, such as nazi doctor josef mengele. certain criminals have achieved lasting fame thanks to romanticization in popular culture, such as guy fawkes, blackbeard, billy the kid and bonnie & clyde. others owe their fame to never being identified or caught, like jack the ripper, or by regularly being interviewed in jail, like charles manson. however, certain criminals are covered far less extensively in media and, as such, do not become very famous at all. in other cases the huge media coverage disappears after the conclusion of their trial, causing them to fade in obscurity again. this has even happened to people who commit high-profile crimes, like françois ravaillac whose murder of henry iv of france in 1610 is nowadays only remembered by people with historic knowledge. in some cases people who've been acquitted of certain crimes are still remembered as being guilty today, like lizzie borden, showing that the sensation occasionally overshadows the actual facts.
the same phenomenon is true for fictional characters. sherlock holmes, dracula, frankenstein's monster and james bond continue to be portrayed in film, television and literature decades after the original stories were published. superman, spider-man, the hulk, wonder woman, and batman represent super heroes to a far wider audience than that of the comics and graphic novels in which they appear. the same can be said about other comics characters which enjoy international distribution and syndication such as popeye, tintin, snoopy, astérix, garfield and astro boy. disney have theme parks around the world which rely on the fame of its creations headed by mickey mouse. thanks to the global reach of film and television characters like king kong, godzilla, the flintstones, the muppets and the simpsons are instantly recognizable to millions. certain fictional characters known from tv series have become so famous that their names are more well known than those of the actors who perform them. a good example is larry hagman who played j.r. ewing on the tv series "dallas". when his character was shot during a cliffhanger episode without the viewers knowing who was the killer, it caused a media hype around the question: "who shot j.r.?". by the time the answer was given in the first episode of the next season millions of people instantly recognized hagman's face as j.r. rather than that of himself. some characters from video and computer games have developed a celebrity life beyond these media, such as mario, lara croft and pikachu. certain advertising characters have also become iconic thanks to decades of constant merchandising, such as ronald mcdonald
, bibendum and hello kitty.
people may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. the term "instant celebrity" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. someone who achieves a small amount of transient fame (through, say, hype or mass media) may become labeled a "b-grade celebrity". often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.
there are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.
though glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.
outside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, invention, medicine, and courtroom law which is not fictional. american microbiologist maurice hilleman is credited with saving more lives than any other medical scientist of the 20th century. after hilleman's death ralph nader wrote, "yet almost no one knew about him, saw him on television, or read about him in newspapers or magazines. his anonymity, in comparison with madonna, michael jackson, jose canseco, or an assortment of grade b actors, tells something about our society's and media's concepts of celebrity; much less of the heroic."
a number of athletes who are unable to turn professional take a second job or even sometimes abandon their athletic aspirations in order to make ends meet. a small percentage of entertainers and athletes are able to make a decent living but a vast majority will spend their careers toiling from hard work, determination, rejection, and frequent unemployment. for minor league to amateur athletes, earnings are usually on the lower end of the pay-scale. many of them take second jobs on the side or even venture into other occupations within the field of sports such as coaching, general management, refereeing, or recruiting and scouting up-and-coming athletes.
the screen actors guild, a union representing actors and actresses throughout hollywood reports that the average television and film actor earns less than us$50,000 annually; the median hourly wage for actors was $18.80 in may 2015. actors sometimes alternate between theater, television, and film or even branch into other occupations within the entertainment industry such as becoming a singer, comedian, producer, or a television host in order to be monetarily diversified, as doing one gig pays comparatively very little. for instance, david letterman is well known for branching into late night television as a talk show host while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, barbra streisand ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or clint eastwood, who achieved even greater fame in hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.
according to american entertainment magnate master p, entertainers and professional athletes make up less than 1% of all millionaires in the entire world. less than 1% of all runway models are known to make more than us$1000 for every fashion showcase. according to the us bureau of labor statistics, the median wage for commercial and print models was only $11.22 per hour in 2006 and was also listed one of the top ten worst jobs in the united states.
"forbes" magazine releases an annual "forbes" celebrity 100 list of the highest paid celebrities in the world. the total earnings for all top celebrity 100 earners totaled $4.5 billion over the course of 2010 alone.
for instance, forbes ranked media mogul and talk show host, oprah winfrey as the top earner "forbes magazine’s annual ranking of the most powerful celebrities", with earnings of $290 million in the past year. forbes cites that lady gaga reportedly earned over $90 million in 2010. in 2010, golfer tiger woods was one of highest-earning celebrity athletes, with an income of $75 million and is consistently ranked one of the highest paid athletes in the world. in 2013, madonna was ranked as the fifth most powerful and the highest earning celebrity of the year with earnings of $125 million. she has consistently been among the most powerful and highest earning celebrities in the world, occupying the third place in forbes celebrity 100 2009 with $110 million of earnings, and getting the tenth place in the 2010 edition of the list with annual earnings equal to $58 million.
celebrity endorsements have proven very successful around the world where, due to increasing consumerism, an individual is considered to own a status symbol when they purchase a celebrity-endorsed product. although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, a number of celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country's economy.
numerous celebrities have ventured into becoming business moguls and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known american business leaders such as bill gates and warren buffett. for instance, basketball legend michael jordan became an active entrepreneur involved with many sports related ventures including investing a minority stake in the charlotte bobcats, paul newman started his own salad dressing business after leaving behind a distinguished acting career, and rap musician birdman started his own record label, clothing line, and an oil business while maintaining a career as a rap artist. brazilian football legend and world cup winner ronaldo became the majority owner of la liga club real valladolid in 2018. other celebrities such as tyler perry, george lucas, and steven spielberg have become successful entrepreneurs through starting their own film production companies and running their own movie studios beyond their traditional activities of screenwriting, directing, animating, producing, and acting.
various examples of celebrity turned entrepreneurs included in the table below are:
tabloid magazines and talk tv shows bestow a great deal of attention on celebrities. to stay in the public eye and build wealth in addition to their salaried labor, numerous celebrities have participating and branching into various business ventures and endorsements. many celebrities have participated in many different endorsement opportunities that include: animation, publishing, fashion designing, cosmetics, consumer electronics, household items and appliances, cigarettes, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, hair care, hairdressing, jewelry design, fast food, credit cards, video games, writing, and toys.
in addition to various endorsements, a number of celebrities have been involved with some business and investment related ventures also include: and toddler related items, sports team ownership, fashion retailing, establishments such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and casinos, movie theaters, advertising and event planning, management related ventures such as sports management, financial services, model management, and talent management, record labels, film production, television production, publishing such as book and music publishing, massage therapy, salons, health and fitness, and real estate.
although some celebrities have achieved additional financial success from various business ventures, the vast majority of celebrities are not successful businesspeople and still rely on salaried labored wages in order to earn a living. most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. not all celebrities eventually succeed with their own businesses and other related side ventures. some celebrities either went broke or filed for bankruptcy as result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. though some might question such a validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. the average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public does not the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. this means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.
celebrities often have fame comparable to royalty. as a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. the release of kim kardashian's sex tape with rapper ray j in 2003 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and reality tv series.
celebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. when seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views. for example, matt damon expressed his displeasure with 2008 us vice presidential nominee sarah palin, as well as with the 2011 united states debt-ceiling crisis.
famous for being famous, in popular culture terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity. the term is a pejorative, suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities. even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.
the coinages "famesque" and "celebutante" are of similar pejorative gist.
also known as being "internet famous", contemporary fame does not always involve a physical red carpet.
a report by bbc highlighted a longtime trend of asian internet celebrities such as chinese celebrity wang hong (birth name ling ling). according to bbc, there are two kinds of online celebrities in china—those who create original content, such as papi jiang, who is regularly censored by chinese authorities for cussing in her videos, and those such as wang hong and zhang dayi, who fall under the second category, as they have clothing and cosmetics businesses on taobao, china's equivalent of amazon.
most high-profile celebrities participate in social networking and photo or video hosting platforms such as youtube, twitter, facebook, instagram, and snapchat. social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as "us weekly" and "people weekly". celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as perez hilton who is well known for not only blogging, but also outing celebrities.
social media and the rise of the smartphone has changed how celebrities are treated and how people gain the platform of fame. not everything is as concealed as it was back in old hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. websites like twitter, facebook, instagram and youtube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. for example, justin bieber got his start on youtube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. all of his fans got direct contact to his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. instagram and youtube gives regular people an opportunity to become rich and famous all from inside their home. it also gives fans the opportunity to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person. everything is being shared on social media so it makes it harder for celebrities to live private lives.</ref> knibbs, kate
social media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as tila tequila who became known through myspace.
another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. in some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. for example, the kennedy family is associated with us politics; the house of windsor with royalty; the hilton and rothschild families with business; the jackson family with popular music; and the osbourne, chaplin, kardashian, baldwin, and barrymore families with television and film.
access to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes managers, publicists, agents, personal assistants, and bodyguards. even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews. an interview with writer and actor michael musto cites:
celebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive paparazzi photographers or autograph-seeking fans) to serious (assault, kidnapping, assassination, or stalking). the bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.
celebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.
andy warhol famously coined the phrase "15 minutes of fame" in reference to a short-lived publicity. certain "15 minutes of fame" celebrities can be average people seen with an a-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as e! news. these persons are ordinary people becoming celebrities, often based on the ridiculous things they do. "in fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on tv is that they're real."
certain people are only remembered today because of a movie portrayal, certain story or urban legend surrounding their life and less for their accomplishments. antonio salieri was a famous and well-known 18th-century composer, but his fictional portrayal as an antagonist (for example, in the musical and film "amadeus") has been more famous than his music since the end of the 20th century. roscoe "fatty" arbuckle and o. j. simpson are more notorious for their association with murder trials than for their respective movie and sports careers. centuries after his death, andrea mantegna is now better known as the mentor of leonardo da vinci than for his own paintings.
john cleese said being famous offers some advantages such as financial wealth and easier access to things that are more difficult for non-famous people to access, such as the ability to more easily meet other famous or powerful people, but that being famous also often comes with the disadvantage of creating the conditions in which the celebrity finds themselves acting, at least temporarily (although sometimes over extended periods of time), in a superficial, inauthentic fashion.
common threats such as stalking have spawned celebrity worship syndrome where a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal life. psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film, television, sport and music stars, the disparity in salaries in society seems to value professional athletes and entertainment industry based professionals. one study found that singers, musicians, actors and athletes die younger on average than writers, composers, academics, politicians and businesspeople, with a greater incidence of cancer and especially lung cancer. however, it was remarked that the reasons for this remained unclear, with theories including innate tendencies towards risk-taking as well as the pressure or opportunities of particular types of fame.
furthermore, some have said fame might have negative psychological effects, and may lead to increasingly selfish tendencies and psychopathy.
recently, there has been more attention toward the impact celebrities have on health decisions of the population at large. it is believed that the public will follow celebrities' health advice to some extent. this can have positive impacts when the celebrities give solid, evidence informed health advice, however it can also have detrimental affects if the health advice is not accurate enough.

cluster sampling is a sampling plan used when mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. it is often used in marketing research. in this sampling plan, the total population is divided into these groups (known as clusters) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected. the elements in each cluster are then sampled. if all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a "one-stage" cluster sampling plan. if a simple random subsample of elements is selected within each of these groups, this is referred to as a "two-stage" cluster sampling plan. a common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy. for a fixed sample size, the expected random error is smaller when most of the variation in the population is present internally within the groups, and not between the groups.
the population within a cluster should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, but there should be homogeneity between clusters. each cluster should be a small-scale representation of the total population. the clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. a random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study. in single-stage cluster sampling, all the elements from each of the selected clusters are sampled. in two-stage cluster sampling, a random sampling technique is applied to the elements from each of the selected clusters.
the main difference between cluster sampling and stratified sampling is that in cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the sampling unit so sampling is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage). in stratified sampling, the sampling is done on elements within each strata. in stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from each of the strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are sampled. a common motivation of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. this contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.
there is also multistage cluster sampling, where at least two stages are taken in selecting elements from clusters.
without modifying the estimated parameter, cluster sampling is unbiased when the clusters are approximately the same size. in this case, the parameter is computed by combining all the selected clusters. when the clusters are of different sizes, probability proportionate to size sampling is used. in this sampling plan, the probability of selecting a cluster is proportional to its size, so that a large cluster has a greater probability of selection than a small cluster. however, when clusters are selected with probability proportionate to size, the same number of interviews should be carried out in each sampled cluster so that each unit sampled has the same probability of selection.
an example of cluster sampling is area sampling or geographical cluster sampling. each cluster is a geographical area. because a geographically dispersed population can be expensive to survey, greater economy than simple random sampling can be achieved by grouping several respondents within a local area into a cluster. it is usually necessary to increase the total sample size to achieve equivalent precision in the estimators, but cost savings may make such an increase in sample size feasible.
cluster sampling is used to estimate high mortalities in cases such as wars, famines and natural disasters.
major use: when sampling frame of all elements is not available we can resort only to the cluster sampling.
two-stage cluster sampling, a simple case of multistage sampling, is obtained by selecting cluster samples in the first stage and then selecting sample of elements from every sampled cluster. consider a population of "n" clusters in total. in the first stage, "n" clusters are selected using ordinary cluster sampling method. in the second stage, simple random sampling is usually used. it is used separately in every cluster and the numbers of elements selected from different clusters are not necessarily equal. the total number of clusters "n", number of clusters selected "n", and numbers of elements from selected clusters need to be pre-determined by the survey designer. two-stage cluster sampling aims at minimizing survey costs and at the same time controlling the uncertainty related to estimates of interest. this method can be used in health and social sciences. for instance, researchers used two-stage cluster sampling to generate a representative sample of the iraqi population to conduct mortality surveys. sampling in this method can be quicker and more reliable than other methods, which is why this method is now used frequently.
cluster sampling methods can lead to significant bias when working with a small number of clusters. for instance, it can be necessary to cluster at the state or city level, units that may be small and fixed in number. microeconometrics methods for panel data often use short panels, which is analogous to having few observations per clusters and many clusters. the small cluster problem can be viewed as an incidental parameter problem. while the point estimates can be reasonably precisely estimated, if the number of observations per cluster is sufficiently high, we need the number of clusters formula_1 for the asymptotics to kick in. if the number of clusters is low the estimated covariance matrix can be downward biased.
small numbers of clusters is a risk when there is serial correlation or when there is intraclass correlation as in the moulton context. when having few clusters, we tend to underestimate serial correlation across observations when a random shock occurs, or the intraclass correlation in a moulton setting. several studies have highlighted the consequences of serial correlation correlation and highlighted the small-cluster problem.
in the framework of the moulton factor, an intuitive explanation of the small cluster problem can be derived from the formula for the moulton factor. assume for simplicity that the number of observation per cluster is fixed at "n". below, formula_2 stands for the covariance matrix adjusted for clustering, formula_3 stands for the covariance matrix not adjusted for clustering, and ρ stands for the intraclass correlation:
formula_4
the ratio on the left-hand side provides an indication of how much the unadjusted scenario overestimates the precision. therefore, a high number means a strong downward bias of the estimated covariance matrix. a small cluster problem can be interpreted as a large n: when the data is fixed and the number of clusters is low, the number of data within a cluster can be high. it follows that inference when the number of clusters is small will not have correct coverage.
several solutions for the small cluster problem have been proposed. one can use a bias-corrected cluster-robust variance matrix, make t-distribution adjustments, or use bootstrap methods with asymptotic refinements, such as the percentile-t or wild bootstrap, that can lead to improved finite sample inference. cameron, gelbach and miller (2008) provide microsimulations for different methods and find that the wild bootstrap performs well in the face of a small number of clusters.

charles pierre baudelaire (, ; ; 9 april 1821 – 31 august 1867) was a french poet who also produced notable work as an essayist, art critic, and pioneering translator of edgar allan poe.
his most famous work, a book of lyric poetry titled "les fleurs du mal" ("the flowers of evil"), expresses the changing nature of beauty in the rapidly industrializing paris during the mid-19th century. baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including paul verlaine, arthur rimbaud and stéphane mallarmé, among many others. he is credited with coining the term "modernity" ("modernité") to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility of artistic expression to capture that experience.
baudelaire was born in paris, france, on 9 april 1821, and baptized two months later at saint-sulpice roman catholic church. his father, joseph-françois baudelaire (1759-1827), a senior civil servant and amateur artist, was 34 years older than baudelaire's mother, caroline ( dufaÿs) (1794-1871). françois died during baudelaire's childhood, at rue hautefeuille, paris, on february 10, 1827. the following year, caroline married lieutenant colonel jacques aupick, who later became a french ambassador to various noble courts. baudelaire's biographers have often seen this as a crucial moment, considering that finding himself no longer the sole focus of his mother's affection left him with a trauma, which goes some way to explaining the excesses later apparent in his life. he stated in a letter to her that, "there was in my childhood a period of passionate love for you." baudelaire regularly begged his mother for money throughout his career, often promising that a lucrative publishing contract or journalistic commission was just around the corner.
baudelaire was educated in lyon, where he boarded. at fourteen he was described by a classmate as "much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils ... we are bound to one another ... by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature." baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to "idleness". later, he attended the lycée louis-le-grand in paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. he began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted gonorrhea and syphilis during this period. he also began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. upon gaining his degree in 1839, he told his brother "i don't feel i have a vocation for anything." his stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. his mother later recalled: "oh, what grief! if charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career would have been very different... he would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us."
his stepfather sent him on a voyage to calcutta, india, in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits. the trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry. (baudelaire later exaggerated his aborted trip to create a legend about his youthful travels and experiences, including "riding on elephants".) on returning to the taverns of paris, he began to compose some of the poems of "les fleurs du mal". at 21, he received a sizable inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years. his family obtained a decree to place his property in trust, which he resented bitterly, at one point arguing that allowing him to fail financially would have been the one sure way of teaching him to keep his finances in order.
baudelaire became known in artistic circles as a dandy and free-spender, going through much of his inheritance and allowance in a short period of time. during this time, jeanne duval became his mistress. she was rejected by his family. his mother thought duval a "black venus" who "tortured him in every way" and drained him of money at every opportunity. baudelaire made a suicide attempt during this period.
he took part in the revolutions of 1848 and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper. however, his interest in politics was passing, as he was later to note in his journals.
in the early 1850s, baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output. he often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors. he undertook many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by edgar allan poe.
upon the death of his stepfather in 1857, baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. at 36 he wrote her: "believe that i belong to you absolutely, and that i belong only to you." his mother died on 16 august 1871, outliving her son by almost four years.
his first published work, under the pseudonym baudelaire dufaÿs, was his art review "salon of 1845", which attracted immediate attention for its boldness. many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, including his championing of delacroix, and some of his views seem remarkably in tune with the future theories of the impressionist painters.
in 1846, baudelaire wrote his second salon review, gaining additional credibility as an advocate and critic of romanticism. his continued support of delacroix as the foremost romantic artist gained widespread notice. the following year baudelaire's novella "la fanfarlo" was published.
baudelaire was a slow and very attentive worker. however he was often sidetracked by indolence, emotional distress and illness, and it was not until 1857 that he published his first and most famous volume of poems, "les fleurs du mal" ("the flowers of evil"). some of these poems had already appeared in the "revue des deux mondes" ("review of two worlds") in 1855, when they were published by baudelaire's friend auguste poulet malassis. some of the poems had also previously appeared as "fugitive verse" in various french magazines during the previous decade.
the poems found a small, yet appreciative audience. however, greater public attention was given to their subject matter. the effect on fellow artists was, as théodore de banville stated, "immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear". gustave flaubert, recently attacked in a similar fashion for "madame bovary" (and acquitted), was impressed and wrote to baudelaire: "you have found a way to rejuvenate romanticism... you are as unyielding as marble, and as penetrating as an english mist."
the principal themes of sex and death were considered scandalous for the period. he also touched on lesbianism, sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the corruption of the city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine. notable in some poems is baudelaire's use of imagery of the sense of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of nostalgia and past intimacy.
the book, however, quickly became a byword for unwholesomeness among mainstream critics of the day. some critics called a few of the poems "masterpieces of passion, art and poetry," but other poems were deemed to merit no less than legal action to suppress them. j. habas led the charge against baudelaire, writing in "le figaro": "everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible, everything one understands is putrid." baudelaire responded to the outcry in a prophetic letter to his mother:
"you know that i have always considered that literature and the arts pursue an aim independent of morality. beauty of conception and style is enough for me. but this book, whose title ("fleurs du mal") says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. it was created with rage and patience. besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. the book enrages people. moreover, since i was terrified myself of the horror that i should inspire, i cut out a third from the proofs. they deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even the knowledge of the french language. i don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and i know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of v. hugo, th. gautier and even byron."
baudelaire, his publisher and the printer were successfully prosecuted for creating an offense against public morals. they were fined, but baudelaire was not imprisoned. six of the poems were suppressed, but printed later as "les épaves" ("the wrecks") (brussels, 1866). another edition of "les fleurs du mal", without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861. many notables rallied behind baudelaire and condemned the sentence. victor hugo wrote to him: "your "fleurs du mal" shine and dazzle like stars... i applaud your vigorous spirit with all my might." baudelaire did not appeal the judgment, but his fine was reduced. nearly 100 years later, on may 11, 1949, baudelaire was vindicated, the judgment officially reversed, and the six banned poems reinstated in france.
in the poem "au lecteur" ("to the reader") that prefaces "les fleurs du mal", baudelaire accuses his readers of hypocrisy and of being as guilty of sins and lies as the poet:
baudelaire next worked on a translation and adaptation of thomas de quincey's "confessions of an english opium eater". other works in the years that followed included "petits poèmes en prose" ("small prose poems"); a series of art reviews published in the "pays, exposition universelle" ("country, world fair"); studies on gustave flaubert (in "l'artiste", october 18, 1857); on théophile gautier ("revue contemporaine", september 1858); various articles contributed to eugene crepet's "poètes francais"; "les paradis artificiels: opium et haschisch" ("french poets; artificial paradises: opium and hashish") (1860); and "un dernier chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de balzac" ("a final chapter of the history of works of balzac") (1880), originally an article "comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du génie" ("how one pays one's debts when one has genius"), in which his criticism turns against his friends honoré de balzac, théophile gautier, and gérard de nerval.
by 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of laudanum, his life of stress, and his poverty had taken a toll and baudelaire had aged noticeably. but at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at honfleur. baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem "le voyage" being one example of his efforts during that time. in 1860, he became an ardent supporter of richard wagner.
his financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher poulet malassis went bankrupt in 1861. in 1864, he left paris for belgium, partly in the hope of selling the rights to his works and also to give lectures. his long-standing relationship with jeanne duval continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. baudelaire's relationships with actress marie daubrun and with courtesan apollonie sabatier, though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. he smoked opium, and in brussels he began to drink to excess. baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and paralysis followed. after more than a year of aphasia, he received the last rites of the catholic church. the last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in "maisons de santé" in brussels and in paris, where he died on 31 august 1867. baudelaire is buried in the cimetière du montparnasse, paris.
many of baudelaire's works were published posthumously. after his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and at last she found some comfort in baudelaire's emerging fame. "i see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature." she lived another four years.
baudelaire is one of the major innovators in french literature. his poetry is influenced by the french romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connects it more closely to the work of the contemporary "parnassians". as for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with decadence) and refined sensual and aesthetic pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice. formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of "symbols" (images that take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the symbolists verlaine and mallarmé, who acknowledge baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard.
beyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and "correspondences", an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work that regularly receive much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of "satanism", his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e.g., wagner, delacroix). he made paris the subject of modern poetry. he would bring the city's details to life in the eyes and hearts of his readers.
baudelaire was an active participant in the artistic life of his times. as critic and essayist, he wrote extensively and perceptively about the luminaries and themes of french culture. he was frank with friends and enemies, rarely took the diplomatic approach and sometimes responded violently verbally, which often undermined his cause. his associations were numerous and included: gustave courbet, honoré daumier, franz liszt, champfleury, victor hugo, gustave flaubert, balzac and the artists and writers that follow.
in 1847, baudelaire became acquainted with the works of poe, in which he found tales and poems that had, he claimed, long existed in his own brain but never taken shape. baudelaire saw in poe a precursor and tried to be his french contemporary counterpart. from this time until 1865, he was largely occupied with translating poe's works; his translations were widely praised. baudelaire was not the first french translator of poe, but his "scrupulous translations" were considered among the best. these were published as "histoires extraordinaires" ("extraordinary stories") (1856), "nouvelles histoires extraordinaires" ("new extraordinary stories") (1857), "aventures d'arthur gordon pym", "", and "histoires grotesques et sérieuses" ("grotesque and serious stories") (1865). two essays on poe are to be found in his "oeuvres complètes" ("complete works") (vols. v. and vi.).
a strong supporter of the romantic painter delacroix, baudelaire called him "a poet in painting". baudelaire also absorbed much of delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. as baudelaire elaborated in his "salon of 1846", "as one contemplates his series of pictures, one seems to be attending the celebration of some grievous mystery... this grave and lofty melancholy shines with a dull light ... plaintive and profound like a melody by weber." delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of "les fleurs du mal". in private correspondence, delacroix stated that baudelaire "really gets on my nerves" and he expressed his unhappiness with baudelaire's persistent comments about "melancholy" and "feverishness".
baudelaire had no formal musical training, and knew little of composers beyond beethoven and weber. weber was in some ways wagner's precursor, using the leitmotif and conceiving the idea of the "total art work" ("gesamtkunstwerk"), both of which gained baudelaire's admiration. before even hearing wagner's music, baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and formulated his impressions. later, baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay "richard wagner et tannhäuser à paris". baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. "music engulfs (possesses) me like the sea." after attending three wagner concerts in paris in 1860, baudelaire wrote to the composer: "i had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air." baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of wagner and to the cult of wagnerism that swept europe in the following decades.
gautier, writer and poet, earned baudelaire's respect for his perfection of form and his mastery of language, though baudelaire thought he lacked deeper emotion and spirituality. both strove to express the artist's inner vision, which heinrich heine had earlier stated: "in artistic matters, i am a supernaturalist. i believe that the artist can not find all his forms in nature, but that the most remarkable are revealed to him in his soul." gautier's frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced baudelaire's writings. in gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision, baudelaire dedicated "les fleurs du mal" to gautier.
manet and baudelaire became constant companions from around 1855. in the early 1860s, baudelaire accompanied manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. manet also lent baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when baudelaire went to belgium. baudelaire encouraged manet to strike out on his own path and not succumb to criticism. "manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time. but he has a weak character. he seems to me crushed and stunned by shock." in his painting "music in the tuileries", manet includes portraits of his friends théophile gautier, jacques offenbach, and baudelaire. while it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both manet and baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. baudelaire praised the modernity of manet's subject matter: "almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings." when manet's famous "olympia" (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of renaissance motifs, baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). when baudelaire returned from belgium after his stroke, manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she would play passages from wagner for baudelaire on the piano.
nadar (félix tournachon) was a noted caricaturist, scientist and important early photographer. baudelaire admired nadar, one of his closest friends, and wrote: "nadar is the most amazing manifestation of vitality." they moved in similar circles and baudelaire made many social connections through him. nadar's ex-mistress jeanne duval became baudelaire's mistress around 1842. baudelaire became interested in photography in the 1850s and, denouncing it as an art form, advocated its return to "its real purpose, which is that of being the servant to the sciences and arts". photography should not, according to baudelaire, encroach upon "the domain of the impalpable and the imaginary". nadar remained a stalwart friend right to baudelaire's last days and wrote his obituary notice in "le figaro".
many of baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time. he wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters.
"there is an invincible taste for prostitution in the heart of man, from which comes his horror of solitude. he wants to be 'two'. the man of genius wants to be 'one'... it is this horror of solitude, the need to lose oneself in the external flesh, that man nobly calls 'the need to love'."
"unable to suppress love, the church wanted at least to disinfect it, and it created marriage."
"the more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. to copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself."
"personally, i think that the unique and supreme delight lies in the certainty of doing 'evil'–and men and women know from birth that all pleasure lies in evil."
"but what can eternity of damnation matter to someone who has felt, if only for a second, the infinity of delight??"
along with poe, baudelaire named the arch-reactionary joseph de maistre as his "maître à penser" and adopted increasingly aristocratic views. in his journals, he wrote, "there is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. a monarchy or a republic, based upon democracy, are equally absurd and feeble. the immense nausea of advertisements. there are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. to know, to kill and to create. the rest of mankind may be taxed and drudged, they are born for the stable, that is to say, to practise what they call professions."
"in this regards, my friend, you're like the public, to whom one should never offer a delicate perfume. it exasperates them. give them only carefully selected garbage."
"the will to work must dominate, for art is long and time is brief." (quoting hippocrates)
"each man bears within himself his own dose of natural opium, incessantly secreted and renewed, and, from birth to death, how many hours can we count filled with pleasure, with prosperous and effective action?"
baudelaire's influence on the direction of modern french (and english) language literature was considerable. the most significant french writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, arthur rimbaud praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true god'. in 1895, stéphane mallarmé published a sonnet in baudelaire's memory, 'le tombeau de charles baudelaire'. marcel proust, in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with alfred de vigny, baudelaire was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.
in the english-speaking world, edmund wilson credited baudelaire as providing an initial impetus for the symbolist movement, by virtue of his translations of poe. in 1930, t. s. eliot, while asserting that baudelaire had not yet received a "just appreciation" even in france, claimed that the poet had "great genius" and asserted that his "technical mastery which can hardly be overpraised ... has made his verse an inexhaustible study for later poets, not only in his own language". in a lecture delivered in french on "edgar allan poe and france" (edgar poe et la france) in aix-en-provence in april 1948, eliot stated that "i am an english poet of american origin who learnt his art under the aegis of baudelaire and the baudelairian lineage of poets." eliot also alluded to baudelaire's poetry directly in his own poetry. for example, he quoted the last line of baudelaire's 'au lecteur' in the last line of section i of 'the waste land.'
at the same time that eliot was affirming baudelaire's importance from a broadly conservative and explicitly christian viewpoint, left-wing critics such as wilson and walter benjamin were able to do so from a dramatically different perspective. benjamin translated baudelaire's "tableaux parisiens" into german and published a major essay on translation as the foreword.
in the late 1930s, benjamin used baudelaire as a starting point and focus for his monumental attempt at a materialist assessment of 19th-century culture, "das passagenwerk." for benjamin, baudelaire's importance lay in his anatomies of the crowd, of the city and of modernity. he says that, in "les fleurs du mal", "the specific devaluation of the world of things, as manifested in the commodity, is the foundation of baudelaire's allegorical intention." françois porche published a poetry collection called "charles baudelaire: poetry collection" in memory of baudelaire.
vanderbilt university has "assembled one of the world's most comprehensive research collections on ... baudelaire". "les fleurs du mal" has a number of scholarly references.

"casey at the bat: a ballad of the republic sung in the year 1888" is a baseball poem written in 1888 by ernest thayer. first published in "the san francisco examiner" (then called "the daily examiner") on june 3, 1888, it was later popularized by dewolf hopper in many vaudeville performances. it has become one of the best-known poems in american literature. the poem was originally published anonymously (under the pen name "phin", based on thayer's college nickname, "phinney").
a baseball team from the fictional town of "mudville" (implied to be the home team) is losing by two runs in its last inning. both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if casey, mudville's star player, gets to bat. however, casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (cooney and barrows) fail to get on base. the next two batters (flynn and jimmy blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow casey a chance to bat.
surprisingly, flynn hits a single, and blake follows with a double that allows flynn to reach third base. both runners are now in scoring position and casey represents the potential winning run. casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. on the last pitch, the overconfident casey strikes out swinging, ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.
the text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. as a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. it also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.
this is the complete poem as it originally appeared in "the daily examiner". after publication, various versions with minor changes were produced.
thayer said he chose the name "casey" after a non-player of irish ancestry he once knew, and it is open to debate who, if anyone, he modeled the character after. it has been reported that thayer's best friend samuel winslow, who played baseball at harvard, was the inspiration for casey.
another candidate is national league player mike "king" kelly, who became famous when boston paid chicago a record $10,000 for him. he had a personality that fans liked to cheer or jeer. after the 1887 season, kelly went on a playing tour to san francisco. thayer, who wrote "casey" in 1888, covered the san francisco leg for the "san francisco examiner".
thayer, in a letter he wrote in 1905, mentions kelly as showing "impudence" in claiming to have written the poem. the author of the 2004 definitive bio of kelly—which included a close tracking of his vaudeville career—did not find kelly claiming to have been the author.
a month after the poem was published, it was reprinted as "kelly at the bat" in the "new york sporting times".
aside from omitting the first five verses, the only changes from the original are substitutions of kelly for casey, and boston for mudville. king kelly, then of the boston beaneaters, was one of baseball's two biggest stars at the time (along with cap anson).
in 1897, the magazine "current literature" noted the two versions and said, "the locality, as originally given, is mudville, not boston; the latter was substituted to give the poem local color."
sportswriter leonard koppett claimed in a 1979 article that the published poem omits 18 lines penned by thayer which change the entire theme of the poem. koppett said the full version of the poem takes the pitch count on casey to full as his uncle arnold stirs up wagering action in the stands before a wink passes between them and casey throws the game.
dewolf hopper gave the poem's first stage recitation on august 14, 1888, at new york's wallack theatre as part of the comic opera "prinz methusalem" in the presence of the chicago and new york baseball teams, the white stockings and the giants, respectively; august 14, 1888 was also thayer's 25th birthday. hopper became known as an orator of the poem, and recited it more than 10,000 times (by his count—some tabulations are as much as four times higher) before his death.
on stage in the early 1890s, baseball star kelly recited the original "casey" a few dozen times and not the parody. for example, in a review in 1893 of a variety show he was in, the "indianapolis news" said, "many who attended the performance had heard of kelly's singing and his reciting, and many had heard de wolf hopper recite 'casey at the bat' in his inimitable way. kelly recited this in a sing-song, school-boy fashion." upon kelly's death, a writer would say he gained "considerable notoriety by his ludicrous rendition of 'casey at the bat,' with which he concluded his `turn’ [act] at each performance."
during the 1980s, the magic/comedy team penn & teller performed a version of "casey at the bat" with teller (the "silent" partner) struggling to escape a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over a platform of sharp steel spikes. the set-up was that penn jillette would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time. the drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when penn jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that teller had left to work free from his bonds.
on july 4, 2008, jack williams recited the poem accompanied by the boston pops during the annual boston pops fireworks spectacular at boston's 4 july celebration.
on july 14, 2013, the jam rock band furthur performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of doubleday field in cooperstown, new york.
the first recorded version of "casey at the bat" was made by russell hunting, speaking in a broad irish accent, in 1893; an 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the columbia graphophone label by hunting can be accessed from the cylinder preservation and digitization project at the university of california, santa barbara library.
dewolf hopper's more famous recorded recitation was released in october 1906.
in 1946, walt disney released a recording of the narration of the poem by jerry colonna, which accompanied the studio's animated cartoon adaptation of the poem (see below).
in 1973, the cincinnati symphony orchestra commissioned its former composer-in-residence, frank proto, to create a work to feature baseball hall-of-famer johnny bench with the orchestra. the result "casey at the bat – an american folk tale for narrator and orchestra" was an immediate hit and recorded by bench and the orchestra. it has since been performed more than 800 times by nearly every major and metropolitan orchestra in the u.s. and canada.
in 1980, baseball pitcher tug mcgraw recorded "casey at the bat—an american folk tale for narrator and orchestra" by frank proto with peter nero and the philly pops.
in 1996, actor james earl jones recorded the poem with arranger/composer steven reineke and the cincinnati pops orchestra.
in 2013, dave jageler and charlie slowes, both radio announcers for the washington nationals, each made recordings of the poem for the library of congress to mark the 125th anniversary of its first publication.
a rivalry of sorts has developed between two cities claiming to be the mudville described in the poem.
residents of holliston, massachusetts, where there is a neighborhood called mudville, claim it as the mudville described in the poem. thayer grew up in nearby worcester, massachusetts, where he wrote the poem in 1888; his family owned a wool mill less than a mile from mudville's baseball field.
however, residents of stockton, california—which was known for a time as mudville prior to incorporation in 1850—also lay claim to being the inspiration for the poem. in 1887, thayer covered baseball for "the daily examiner"—owned by his harvard classmate william randolph hearst—and is said to have covered the local california league team, the stockton ports. for the 1902 season, after the poem became popular, stockton's team was renamed the mudville nine. the team reverted to the mudville nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. the visalia rawhide, another california league team, currently keep mudville alive by playing in mudville jerseys on june 3 each year.
despite the towns' rival claims, thayer himself told the "syracuse post-standard" that "the poem has no basis in fact."
the poem has been adapted to diverse types of media:
for a relatively short poem apparently dashed off quickly (and denied by its author for years), "casey at the bat" had a profound effect on american popular culture. it has been recited, re-enacted, adapted, dissected, parodied and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine.
"casey's revenge", by grantland rice (1907), gives casey another chance against the pitcher who had struck him out in the original story. it was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine "the speaker" in june 1907, under the pseudonym of james wilson. in this version, rice cites the nickname "strike-out casey", hence the influence on casey stengel's name. casey's team is down "three" runs by the last of the ninth, and once again casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time. however, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.
of the many parodies made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:
there are three known translations of the poem into a foreign language, one in french, written in 2007 by french canadian linguist paul laurendeau, with the title "casey au bâton", and two in hebrew. one by the sports journalist menachem less titled "התור של קייסי לחבוט" [hator shel casey lachbot], and the other more recent and more true to the original cadence and style by jason h. elbaum called קֵיסִי בַּמַּחְבֵּט [casey bamachbayt].
casey stengel describes in his autobiography how his original nickname "k.c." (for his hometown, kansas city, missouri) evolved into "casey". it was influenced not just by the name of the poem, which was widely popular in the 1910s, but also because he tended to strike out frequently in his early career so fans and writers started calling him "strikeout casey".
the poem is referenced in the super nintendo entertainment system game "earthbound", where a weapon is named the casey bat, which is the strongest weapon in the game, but will only hit 25% of the time.
"enter the gungeon" features a weapon called "casey," taking the form of a baseball bat. the quote "batting .50" is displayed when the weapon is picked up.
a one-time character in the "pokémon" anime, a girl who is a very enthusiastic fan of baseball, is named "casey" in the english version in reference to the poem.
a baseball-themed episode of the twilight zone was named the mighty casey in reference to the poem's lead character, though the plot is unrelated.
in the show friends, ross clarifies how to spell "casey" as in "at the bat" in the season 2, episode 14 entitled "the one with the prom video."
in the show containment, season 1, episode 6 takes its name, “he stilled the rising tumult”, from the poem.
on july 11, 1996, the united states postal service issued a commemorative stamp depicting "mighty casey." the stamp was part of a set commemorating american folk heroes. other stamps in the set depicted paul bunyan, john henry, and pecos bill.

the classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or spanish guitar) is a member of the guitar family used in classical music. an acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of gut or nylon, it is a precursor of the acoustic and electric guitars which use metal strings. the name guitar comes from persian language, in which tar means string. tar (string instrument) is also the name of an iranian instrument that could be the primary form of guitar. classical guitars are derived from the spanish vihuela and gittern in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, which later evolved into the seventeenth and eighteenth century baroque guitar and later the modern classical guitar in the mid nineteenth century.
for a right-handed player, the traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is properly held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the sound hole (this is called the classical position). the modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see dreadnought) and is commonly played off the hip.
the phrase "classical guitar" may refer to either of two concepts other than the instrument itself:
the term "modern classical guitar" is sometimes used to distinguish the classical guitar from older forms of guitar, which are in their broadest sense also called "classical", or more specifically, "early guitars". examples of early guitars include the six-string early romantic guitar (c. 1790–1880), and the earlier baroque guitars with five courses.
the materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but the typical shape is either "modern classical guitar" or that "historic classical guitar" similar to the early romantic guitars of france and italy. classical guitar strings once made of gut are now made of such polymers as nylon, with fine wire wound about the acoustically lower (bass side) strings.
a guitar family tree may be identified. the flamenco guitar derives from the modern classical, but has differences in material, construction and sound.
today's "modern classical guitar" was established by the late designs of the 19th-century spanish luthier, antonio torres jurado.
the classical guitar has a long history and one is able to distinguish various:
both instrument and repertoire can be viewed from a combination of various perspectives:
historical (chronological period of time)
geographical
cultural
while "classical guitar" is today mainly associated with the modern classical guitar design, there is an increasing interest in early guitars; and understanding the link between historical repertoire and the particular period guitar that was originally used to perform this repertoire. the musicologist and author graham wade writes:
nowadays it is customary to play this repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation. thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in spain), lute, baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.
different types of guitars have different sound aesthetics, e.g. different colour-spectrum characteristics (the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the overtones), different response, etc. these differences are due to differences in construction; for example modern classical guitars usually use a different bracing (fan-bracing) from that used in earlier guitars (they had ladder-bracing); and a different voicing was used by the luthier.
there is a historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, flamenco, jazz) and the style of "sound aesthetic" of the musical instruments used, for example: robert de visée played a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic from the guitars used by mauro giuliani and luigi legnani – they used 19th century guitars. these guitars in turn sound different from the torres models used by segovia that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as moreno torroba.
when considering the guitar from a historical perspective, the musical instrument used is as important as the musical language and style of the particular period. as an example: it is impossible to play a historically informed de visee or corbetta (baroque guitarist-composers) on a modern classical guitar. the reason is that the baroque guitar used courses, which are two strings close together (in unison), that are plucked together. this gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation. additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar (with its strong overtone presence) is very different from modern classical type guitars, as is shown below.
today's use of torres and post-torres type guitars for repertoire of all periods is sometimes critically viewed: torres and post-torres style modern guitars (with their fan-bracing and design) have a thick and strong tone, very suitable for modern-era repertoire. however, they are considered to emphasize the fundamental too heavily (at the expense of overtone partials) for earlier repertoire (classical/romantic: carulli, sor, giuliani, mertz, ...; baroque: de visee, ...; etc.). "andrés segovia presented the spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles" to the extent, that still today, "many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar, coming from the modern segovia tradition".
while fan-braced modern classical torres and post-torres style instruments coexisted with traditional ladder-braced guitars at the beginning of the 20th century, the traditional forms eventually fell away. some attribute this to the popularity of segovia, considering him "the catalyst for change toward the spanish design and the so-called 'modern' school in the 1920s and beyond." the styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars were becoming more and more unfashionable; and, e.g. in germany, musicians were in part turning towards folk music (schrammel-music and the contraguitar), but this only remained localized in germany and austria and became unfashionable again. on the other hand, segovia was playing in concerts around the world, popularizing his modern classical guitar, as well as a new style of music in the 1920s: spanish romantic-modern style with guitar works by moreno torroba, de falla, etc. some people consider it to have been this influence of segovia which led to the domination of the torres instrument. factories all over the world began producing them in large numbers.
it was the 19th-century classical guitarist francisco tárrega who first popularized the torres design as a classical solo instrument.
composers of the renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include alonso mudarra, miguel de fuenllana, adrian le roy, gregoire brayssing, guillaume de morlaye, and simon gorlier.
four-course guitar
some well known composers of the baroque guitar were gaspar sanz, robert de visée, francesco corbetta and santiago de murcia.
from approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had numerous composers and performers including:
hector berlioz studied the guitar as a teenager, franz schubert owned at least two and wrote for the instrument, ludwig van beethoven, after hearing giuliani play, commented the instrument was "a miniature orchestra in itself". niccolò paganini was also a guitar virtuoso and composer. he once wrote: "i love the guitar for its harmony; it is my constant companion in all my travels". he also said, on another occasion: "i do not like this instrument, but regard it simply as a way of helping me to think"
the guitarist and composer francisco tárrega (november 29, 1852 – december 15, 1909) was one of the great guitar virtuosos and teachers and is considered the father of modern classical guitar playing. as professor of guitar at the conservatories of madrid and barcelona, he defined many elements of the modern classical technique and elevated the importance of the guitar in the classical music tradition.
at the beginning of the 1920s, andrés segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings. segovia collaborated with the composers federico moreno torroba and joaquin turina with the aim of extending the guitar repertoire with new music. segovia's tour of south america revitalized public interest in the guitar and helped the guitar music of manuel ponce and heitor villa-lobos reach a wider audience. the composers alexandre tansman and mario castelnuovo-tedesco were commissioned by segovia to write new pieces for the guitar. luiz bonfá popularized brazilian musical styles such as the newly created bossa nova, which was well received by audiences in the usa.
the classical guitar repertoire also includes modern contemporary works – sometimes termed "new music" – such as elliott carter's "changes", cristóbal halffter's "codex i", luciano berio's "sequenza xi", maurizio pisati's "sette studi", maurice ohana's "si le jour paraît", sylvano bussotti's "rara (eco sierologico)", ernst krenek's "suite für guitarre allein, op. 164", franco donatoni's "algo: due pezzi per chitarra", paolo coggiola's "variazioni notturne", etc.
performers who are known for including modern repertoire include jürgen ruck, elena càsoli, leo brouwer (when he was still performing), john schneider, reinbert evers, maria kämmerling, siegfried behrend, david starobin, mats scheidegger, magnus andersson, etc.
this type of repertoire is usually performed by guitarists who have particularly chosen to focus on the avant-garde in their performances.
within the contemporary music scene itself, there are also works which are generally regarded as extreme. these include works such as brian ferneyhough's "kurze schatten ii", sven-david sandström's "away from" and rolf riehm's "toccata orpheus" etc. which are notorious for their extreme difficulty.
there are also a variety of databases documenting modern guitar works such as sheer pluck and others.
the evolution of the classical guitar and its repertoire spans more than four centuries. it has a history that was shaped by contributions from earlier instruments, such as the lute, the vihuela, and the baroque guitar.
the origins of the modern guitar are not known with certainty. some believe it is indigenous to europe, while others think it is an imported instrument. guitar-like instruments appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from egyptian, sumerian, and babylonian civilizations. this means that the contemporary iranian instruments such as the tanbur and setar are distantly related to the european guitar, as they all derive ultimately from the same ancient origins, but by very different historical routes and influences.
during the late middle ages, gitterns called "guitars" were in use, but their construction and tuning was different from modern guitars. the "guitarra latina" in spain, had curved sides and a single hole. the "guitarra morisca", which appears to have had moorish influences, had an oval soundbox and many sound holes on its soundboard. by the 15th century, a four course double-string instrument called the vihuela de mano, that had tuning like the later modern guitar except on one string and similar construction, first appeared in spain and spread to france and italy. in the 16th century, a fifth double-string was added. during this time, composers wrote mostly in tablature notation. in the middle of the 16th century, influences from the vihuela and the renaissance guitar were combined and the baroque five string guitar appeared in spain. the baroque guitar quickly superseded the vihuela in popularity in spain, france and italy and italian players and composers became prominent. in the late 18th century the six string guitar quickly became popular at the expense of the five string guitars. during the 19th century the spanish luthier and player antonio de torres gave the modern classical guitar its definitive form, with a broadened body, increased waist curve, thinned belly, improved internal bracing. the modern classical guitar replaced an older form for the accompaniment of song and dance called flamenco, and a modified version, known as the flamenco guitar, was created.
alonso de mudarra's book "tres libros de música", published in spain in 1546, contains the earliest known written pieces for a four-course guitarra. this four-course "guitar" was popular in france, spain, and italy. in france this instrument gained popularity among aristocrats. a considerable volume of music was published in paris from the 1550s to the 1570s: simon gorlier's le troysième livre... mis en tablature de guiterne was published in 1551. in 1551 adrian le roy also published his premier livre de tablature de guiterne, and in the same year he also published briefve et facile instruction pour apprendre la tablature a bien accorder, conduire, et disposer la main sur la guiterne. robert ballard, grégoire brayssing from augsburg, and guillaume morlaye (c. 1510 – c. 1558) significantly contributed to its repertoire. morlaye's le premier livre de chansons, gaillardes, pavannes, bransles, almandes, fantasies – which has a four-course instrument illustrated on its title page – was published in partnership with michel fedenzat, and among other music, they published six books of tablature by lutenist albert de rippe (who was very likely guillaume's teacher).
the written history of the classical guitar can be traced back to the early 16th century with the development of the "vihuela" in spain. while the lute was then becoming popular in other parts of europe, the spaniards did not take to it well because of its association with the moors. instead, the lute-like vihuela appeared with two more strings that gave it more range and complexity. in its most developed form, the vihuela was a guitar-like instrument with six double strings made of gut, tuned like a modern classical guitar with the exception of the third string, which was tuned half a step lower. it has a high sound and is rather large to hold. few have survived and most of what is known today comes from diagrams and paintings.
the earliest extant six-string guitar is believed to have been built in 1779 by gaetano vinaccia (1759 – after 1831) in naples, italy; however, the date on the label is a little ambiguous. the vinaccia family of luthiers is known for developing the mandolin. this guitar has been examined and does not show tell-tale signs of modifications from a double-course guitar.
the authenticity of guitars allegedly produced before the 1790s is often in question. this also corresponds to when moretti's 6-string method appeared, in 1792.
the "modern classical guitar" (also known as the "spanish guitar"), the immediate forerunner of today's guitars, was developed in the 19th century by antonio de torres jurado, ignacio fleta, hermann hauser sr., and robert bouchet.
the fingerstyle is used fervently on the modern classical guitar. the thumb traditionally plucks the bass – or root note – whereas the fingers ring the melody and its accompanying parts. noted players were: francisco tárrega, emilio pujol, andrés segovia
in the 20th century, many non-guitarist composers wrote for the instrument, which previously only players of the instrument had done. these included: francisco tárrega (1852–1909), roberto gerhard (1896–1970), and heitor villa-lobos (1887–1959)
the modern classical guitar is usually played in a seated position, with the instrument resting on the left lap – and the left foot placed on a footstool. alternatively – if a footstool is not used – a "guitar support" can be placed between the guitar and the left lap (the support usually attaches to the instrument's side with suction cups). (there are of course exceptions, with some performers choosing to hold the instrument another way.)
right-handed players use the fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings, with the thumb plucking from the top of a string downwards (downstroke) and the other fingers plucking from the bottom of string upwards (upstroke). the little finger in classical technique as it evolved in the 20th century is used only to ride along with the ring finger without striking the strings and to thus physiologically facilitate the ring finger's motion.
in contrast, flamenco technique, and classical compositions evoking flamenco, employ the little finger semi-independently in the flamenco four-finger rasgueado, that rapid strumming of the string by the fingers in reverse order employing the back of the fingernail—a familiar characteristic of flamenco.
flamenco technique, in the performance of the rasgueado also uses the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb: the string is hit not only with the inner, fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer, fingernail side. this was also used in a technique of the vihuela called dedillo which has recently begun to be introduced on the classical guitar.
some modern guitarists, such as štěpán rak and kazuhito yamashita, use the little finger independently, compensating for the little finger's shortness by maintaining an extremely long fingernail. rak and yamashita have also generalized the use of the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb (the same technique as in the rasgueado of the flamenco: as explained above the string is hit not only with the inner, fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer, fingernail side) both as a free stroke and as a rest stroke.
as with other plucked instruments (such as the lute), the musician directly touches the strings (usually plucking) to produce the sound. this has important consequences: different tone/timbre (of a single note) can be produced by plucking the string in different manners and in different positions. for example, plucking an open string will sound brighter than playing the same note(s) on a fretted position (which would have a warmer tone).
the instrument's versatility means it can create a variety of tones, but this also makes the instrument harder to learn than a standard acoustic guitar.
in guitar "scores" the five fingers of the right-hand (which pluck the strings) are designated by the first letter of their spanish names namely p = thumb ("pulgar"), i = index finger ("índice"), m = middle finger ("mayor"), a = ring finger ("anular"), c = little finger or pinky ("meñique/chiquito")
the four fingers of the left hand (which stop the strings) are designated 1 = index, 2 = major, 3 = ring finger, 4 = little finger; 0 designates an open string, that is a string that is not stopped by a finger of the left hand and whose full length thus vibrates when plucked. on the classical guitar thumb of the left hand is never used to stop strings from above (as is done on the electric guitar): the neck of a classical guitar is too wide and the normal position of the thumb used in classical guitar technique do not make that possible.
scores (contrary to "tablatures") do not systematically indicate the string to be plucked (although in most cases the choice is obvious). when an indication of the string is required the strings are designated 1 to 6 (from the 1st the high e to the 6th the low e) with figures 1 to 6 inside circles.
the positions (that is where on the fretboard the first finger of the left hand is placed) are also not systematically indicated, but when they are (mostly in the case of the execution of "barrés") these are indicated with roman numerals from the first position i (index finger of the left hand placed on the 1st fret: f-b flat-e flat-a flat-c-f) to the twelfth position xii (the index finger of the left hand placed on the 12th fret: e-a-d-g-b-e; the 12th fret is placed where the body begins) or even higher up to position xix (the classical guitar most often having 19 frets, with the 19th fret being most often split and not being usable to fret the 3rd and 4th strings).
to achieve tremolo effects and rapid, fluent scale passages, the player must practice alternation, that is, never plucking a string with the same finger twice in a row.
using p to indicate the thumb, i the index finger, m the middle finger and a the ring finger, common alternation patterns include:
music written specifically for the classical guitar dates from the addition of the sixth string (the baroque guitar normally had five pairs of strings) in the late 18th century.
a guitar recital may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as john dowland (b. england 1563) and luis de narváez (b. spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by domenico scarlatti (b. italy 1685), for the baroque lute by sylvius leopold weiss (b. germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by robert de visée (b. france c. 1650) or even spanish-flavored music written for the piano by isaac albéniz (b. spain 1860) and enrique granados (b. spain 1867). the most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is johann sebastian bach (b. germany 1685), whose baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument.
of music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include fernando sor (b. spain 1778) and mauro giuliani (b. italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by viennese classicism. in the 19th century guitar composers such as johann kaspar mertz (b. slovakia, austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. francisco tárrega (b. spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. this was part of late 19th century mainstream european musical nationalism. albéniz and granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire.
the steel-string and electric guitars characteristic to the rise of rock and roll in the post-wwii era became more widely played in north america and the english speaking world. agustín barrios mangoré of paraguay composed many works and brought into the mainstream the characteristics of latin american music, as did the brazilian composer heitor villa-lobos. andrés segovia commissioned works from spanish composers such as federico moreno torroba and joaquín rodrigo, italians such as mario castelnuovo-tedesco and latin american composers such as manuel ponce of mexico. other prominent latin american composers are leo brouwer of cuba, antonio lauro of venezuela and enrique solares of guatemala. julian bream of britain managed to get nearly every british composer from william walton to benjamin britten to peter maxwell davies to write significant works for guitar. bream's collaborations with tenor peter pears also resulted in song cycles by britten, lennox berkeley and others. there are significant works by composers such as hans werner henze of germany, gilbert biberian of england and roland chadwick of australia.
the classical guitar also became widely used in popular music and rock & roll in the 1960s after guitarist mason williams popularized the instrument in his instrumental hit classical gas. guitarist christopher parkening is quoted in the book "classical gas: the music of mason williams" as saying that it is the most requested guitar piece besides malagueña and perhaps the best known instrumental guitar piece today.
in the field of new flamenco, the works and performances of spanish composer and player paco de lucía are known worldwide.
not many classical guitar concertos were written through the guitar history. nevertheless, some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular, especially joaquín rodrigo's "concierto de aranjuez" (with the famous theme from 2nd movement) and "fantasía para un gentilhombre". composers, who also wrote famous guitar concertos are: antonio vivaldi (originally for mandolin or lute), mauro giuliani, heitor villa-lobos, mario castelnuovo-tedesco, manuel ponce, leo brouwer, lennox berkeley...
nowadays, more and more contemporary composers decide to write a guitar concerto, among them "bosco sacro" by federico biscione, for guitar and string orchestra, is one of the most inspired.
the classical guitar is distinguished by a number of characteristics:
the fretboard (also called the fingerboard) is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck. it is flat or slightly curved. the curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. the smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. fretboards are most commonly made of ebony, but may also be made of rosewood, some other hardwood, or of phenolic composite ("micarta").
frets are the metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the fingerboard and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. the strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale. the ratio of the widths of two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two (formula_1), whose numeric value is about 1.059463. the twelfth fret divides the string in two exact halves and the 24th fret (if present) divides the string in half yet again. every twelve frets represents one octave. this arrangement of frets results in equal tempered tuning.
a classical guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its neck. the wood for the fretboard usually differs from the wood in the rest of the neck. the bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used.
this is the point where the neck meets the body. in the traditional spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. these joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners. bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. some people believed that the spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.
while most traditional spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, fleta, a prominent spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.
one reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was to make it easier to repair necks. this is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. this is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.
the body of the instrument is a major determinant of the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars. the guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce, red cedar, redwood or mahogany. this thin (often 2 or 3 mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar. the majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers (torres, hauser, ramírez, fleta, and c.f. martin being among the most influential designers of their times); to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also to affect the resonation of the top. some contemporary guitar makers have introduced new construction concepts such as "double-top" consisting of two extra-thin wooden plates separated by nomex, or carbon-fiber reinforced lattice – pattern bracing. the back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany, maple, cypress indian rosewood and highly regarded brazilian rosewood ("dalbergia nigra"). each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength, and such choice can also play a significant role in determining the instrument's timbre. these are also strengthened with internal bracing, and decorated with inlays and purfling.
the body of a classical guitar is a resonating chamber that projects the vibrations of the body through a "sound hole", allowing the acoustic guitar to be heard without amplification. the sound hole is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or numbers of holes. how much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume.
the top, back and sides of a classical guitar body are very thin, so a flexible piece of wood called "kerfing" (because it is often scored, or "kerfed" so it bends with the shape of the rim) is glued into the corners where the rim meets the top and back. this interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints.
during final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called "purfling". this binding serves to seal off the endgrain of the top and back. binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials.
the main purpose of the bridge on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings. the bridge holds the strings in place on the body. also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).
the modern full size classical guitar has a scale length of around , with an overall instrument length of . the scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument, antonio de torres. this length may have been chosen because it's twice the length of a violin string. as the guitar is tuned to one octave below that of the violin, the same size gut could be used for the first strings of both instruments.
smaller-scale instruments are produced to assist children in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together, making it easier for smaller hands. the scale-size for the smaller guitars is usually in the range , with an instrument length of . full-size instruments are sometimes referred to as 4/4, while the smaller sizes are 3/4, 1/2 or 1/4.
these sizes are not absolute, as luthiers may choose variations around these nominal scale-lengths;
guitars can be described in size from largest to smallest as:
– contra or octave bass;
– bass baritone or quint bass;
– prime or quart bass;
– terz treble;
– alto requinto;
– quart;
– quint;
– soprano, octave or piccolo.
a variety of different tunings are used. the most common by far, which one could call the "standard tuning" is:
the above order is the tuning from the "1st string" (highest-pitched string e'—spatially the bottom string in playing position) to the "6th string" – lowest-pitched string e—spatially the upper string in playing position, and hence comfortable to pluck with the thumb.
the explanation for this "asymmetrical" tuning (in the sense that the maj 3rd is not between the two middle strings, as in the tuning of the viola da gamba) is probably that the guitar originated as a 4-string instrument (actually an instrument with 4 double courses of strings, see above) with a maj 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings, and it only became a 6-string instrument by gradual addition of a 5th string and then a 6th string tuned a 4th apart:
"the development of the modern tuning can be traced in stages. one of the tunings from the 16th century is c-f-a-d. this is equivalent to the top four strings of the modern guitar tuned a tone lower. however, the absolute pitch for these notes is not equivalent to modern "concert pitch". the tuning of the four-course guitar was moved up by a tone and toward the end of the 16th century, five-course instruments were in use with an added lower string tuned to a. this produced a-d-g-b-e, one of a wide number of variant tunings of the period. the low e string was added during the 18th century."
this tuning is such that neighboring strings are at most 5 semitones apart.
there are also a variety of commonly used alternate tunings.

eiffel is an object-oriented programming language designed by bertrand meyer (an object-orientation proponent and author of "object-oriented software construction") and eiffel software. meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development; the first version becoming available in 1986. in 2005, eiffel became an iso-standardized language.
the design of the language is closely connected with the eiffel programming method. both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command–query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open–closed principle, and option–operand separation.
many concepts initially introduced by eiffel later found their way into java, c#, and other languages. new language design ideas, particularly through the ecma/iso standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the eiffel language.
the key characteristics of the eiffel language include:
eiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.
eiffel shuns coding tricks or coding techniques intended as optimization hints to the compiler. the aim is not only to make the code more readable, but also to allow programmers to concentrate on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. compilers for computer programs written in eiffel provide extensive optimization techniques, such as automatic in-lining, that relieve the programmer of part of the optimization burden.
eiffel was originally developed by eiffel software, a company founded by bertrand meyer. "object-oriented software construction" contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to eiffel's design.
the design goal behind the eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. eiffel supports multiple inheritance, genericity, polymorphism, encapsulation, type-safe conversions, and parameter covariance. eiffel's most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract (dbc), in which assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.
eiffel's design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. eiffel formally supports abstract data types. under eiffel's design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the "abstract data type".
eiffelstudio is an integrated development environment available under either an open source or a commercial license. it offers an object-oriented environment for software engineering. eiffelenvision is a plug-in for microsoft visual studio that allows users to edit, compile, and debug eiffel projects from within the microsoft visual studio ide. five other open source implementations are available: "the eiffel compiler" tecomp; gobo eiffel; smarteiffel, the gnu implementation, based on an older version of the language; libertyeiffel, based on the smarteiffel compiler; and visual eiffel.
several other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in eiffel. sather, for example, was originally based on eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. the interactive-teaching language blue, forerunner of bluej, is also eiffel-based. the apple media tool includes an eiffel-based apple media language.
the eiffel language definition is an international standard of the iso. the standard was developed by ecma international, which first approved the standard on 21 june 2005 as standard ecma-367, eiffel: analysis, design and programming language. in june 2006, ecma and iso adopted the second version. in november 2006, iso first published that version. the standard can be found and used free of charge on the ecma site. the iso version is identical in all respects except formatting.
eiffel software, "the eiffel compiler" tecomp and eiffel-library-developer gobo have committed to implementing the standard; eiffel software's eiffelstudio 6.1 and "the eiffel compiler" tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms—in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. the smarteiffel team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of eiffel. object tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. libertyeiffel implements a dialect somewhere in between the smarteiffel language and the standard.
the standard cites the following, predecessor eiffel-language specifications:
the current version of the standard from june 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions). the ecma committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.
an eiffel "system" or "program" is a collection of "classes". above the level of classes, eiffel defines "cluster", which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of "subclusters" (nested clusters). clusters are not a syntactic language construct, but rather a standard organizational convention. typically an eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. in this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. for example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, codice_1 might be the name of a file that defines a class called x.
a class contains "features", which are similar to "routines", "members", "attributes" or "methods" in other object-oriented programming languages. a class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a "notes" section for documentation and metadata. eiffel's standard data types, such as codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, are all themselves classes.
every system must have a class designated as "root", with one of its creation procedures designated as "root procedure". executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.
eiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. eiffel's control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.
unlike many object-oriented languages, but like smalltalk, eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of information hiding or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. to put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all eiffel attributes are "protected", and "setters" are needed for client objects to modify values. an upshot of this is that "setters" can, and normally do, implement the invariants for which eiffel provides syntax.
while eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an "assigner command", such as:
while a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the information hiding principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a "setter" being used. in practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like codice_5 as in the example code above.
unlike other languages, having notions of "public", "protected", "private" and so on, eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. for example, (below), the "{none}" is similar to "protected" in other languages. scope applied this way to a "feature set" (e.g. everything below the 'feature' keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the "export" keyword.
feature {none} -- initialization
alternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {any} and is similar to the "public" scoping of other languages.
feature -- constants
finally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the eiffel project universe, such as:
feature {decimal, dcm_ma_decimal_parser, dcm_ma_decimal_handler} -- access
here, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. decimal, dcm_ma_decimal_parser, dcm_ma_decimal_handler).
a programming language's look and feel is often conveyed using a "hello, world!" program. such a program written in eiffel might be:
class
create
feature
end
this program contains the class codice_6. the constructor (create routine) for the class, named codice_7, invokes the codice_8 system library routine to write a codice_9 codice_10 message to the output.
the concept of design by contract is central to eiffel. the contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). class invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.
the eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. eiffelstudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the "workbench mode." when an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ecf file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the auto-test feature found in eiffelstudio.
the design by contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:
in addition, the language supports a "check instruction" (a kind of "assert"), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).
void-safety, like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. void-safe software is protected from run time errors caused by calls to void references, and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. the analogy to static typing is a useful one. in fact, void-safe capability could be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void-safety is integrated into the type system.
the guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). the void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:
the code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether codice_5 will be attached or detached at the point it is used. notably, the codice_12 keyword allows for an "attachment local" (e.g. codice_13), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. codice_13) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void-safe).
the primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or "instances", a feature is an operation on these objects. there are two kinds of features: queries and commands. a query provides information about an instance. a command modifies an instance.
the command-query distinction is important to the eiffel method. in particular:
eiffel does not allow argument overloading. each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. one name, within one class, means one thing. this design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. it also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes eiffel's multiple inheritance mechanism possible.
names can, of course, be reused in different classes. for example, the feature plus (along with its infix alias "+") is defined in several classes: integer, real, string, etc.
a generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. list [phone], a list of phone numbers; account [g->account_type], allowing for account [savings] and account [checking], etc.). classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. generic parameters appear in square brackets:
class list [g] ...
g is known as a "formal generic parameter". (eiffel reserves "argument" for routines, and uses "parameter" only for generic classes.) with such a declaration g represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type g, and a routine can take an argument of that type:
item: g do ... end
put (x: g) do ... end
the codice_17 and codice_18 are "generic derivations" of this class. permitted combinations (with codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22) are:
n := il.item
wl.put (w)
codice_2 and codice_24 are the "actual generic parameters" in these generic derivations.
it is also possible to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the "constraint". for example, in
a derivation codice_25 is valid only if codice_3 inherits from codice_27 (as it indeed does in typical eiffel libraries). within the class, having codice_28 constrained by codice_27 means that for codice_30 it is possible to apply to codice_31 all the features of codice_27, as in codice_33.
to inherit from one or more others, a class will include an codice_34 clause at the beginning:
class c inherit
-- ... rest of class declaration ...
the class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. this must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a codice_35 subclause of the inheritance clause, as in
class c inherit
see for a complete discussion of eiffel inheritance.
classes may be defined with codice_36 rather than with codice_37 to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. non-instantiatable classes are called abstract classes in some other object-oriented programming languages. in eiffel parlance, only an "effective" class can be instantiated (it may be a descendent of a deferred class). a feature can also be deferred by using the codice_38 keyword in place of a codice_39 clause. if a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.
deferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to java's lack of multiple inheritance (which eiffel has).
a class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. it may, however, change their names through codice_40 clauses. this is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.
tuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding "setter" procedure. a typical tuple type reads
and could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. an instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as
components of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if codice_41 has been assigned the above tuple then codice_42 has value 3.5.
thanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in
the tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as codice_43. (in some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ecma standard.)
the precise specification of e.g. codice_44 is that it describes sequences of "at least" three elements, the first three being of types codice_45, codice_46, codice_47 respectively. as a result, codice_44 conforms to (may be assigned to) codice_49, to codice_50 and to codice_51 (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.
eiffel's "agent" mechanism wraps operations into objects. this mechanism can be used for iteration, event-driven programming, and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize functional programming, allow a similar pattern using continuations, closures, or generators; eiffel's agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in smalltalk and ruby.
for example, to execute the codice_52 block for each element of codice_53, one would write:
to execute codice_52 only on elements satisfying codice_55, a limitation/filter can be added:
in these examples, codice_52 and codice_55 are routines. prefixing them with codice_58 yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. so if codice_59 represents that object (for example because codice_59 is the argument to codice_61), the instruction
will call the original routine with the argument codice_31, as if we had directly called the original routine: codice_63. arguments to codice_64 are passed as a tuple, here codice_65.
it is possible to keep some arguments to an agent open and make others closed. the open arguments are passed as arguments to codice_64: they are provided at the time of "agent use". the closed arguments are provided at the time of agent "definition". for example, if codice_67 has two arguments, the iteration
iterates codice_68 for successive values of codice_31, where the second argument remains set to codice_70. the question mark codice_71 indicates an open argument; codice_70 is a closed argument of the agent. note that the basic syntax codice_73 is a shorthand for codice_74 with all arguments open. it is also possible to make the "target" of an agent open through the notation codice_75 where codice_76 is the type of the target.
the distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in lambda calculus. an agent expression such as codice_77 with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation "curried" on the closed operands.
the agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as codice_52, codice_55, codice_67), through inline agents as in
my_list.do_all (agent (s: string)
the inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. this avoids defining routines when all that's needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. this is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:
the current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with "n" arguments is passed to an agent expecting "m" arguments with "m" < "n"). this can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition codice_81 of codice_64. several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by ribet et al.
a routine's result can be cached using the codice_83 keyword in place of codice_39. non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. a common pattern for "once functions" is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. the typical scheme is:
shared_object: some_type
the returned object—codice_85 in the example—can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.
often "once routines" perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. "once routines" are similar in purpose and effect to the singleton pattern in many programming languages, and to the used in python.
by default, a "once routine" is called "once per thread". the semantics can be adjusted to "once per process" or "once per object" by qualifying it with a "once key", e.g. codice_86.
eiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. the mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. to avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:
for example, codice_87 may conform to codice_88, but codice_2 converts to codice_90 (and does not inherit from it).
the conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between codice_2 and codice_90) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. for example, a codice_93 class may be declared to convert to codice_3; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through
as a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:
to make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) codice_95 in a codice_96 clause at the beginning of the class.
as another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from codice_97, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in
exception handling in eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. for example, an exception occurs when a routine's caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. in eiffel, exception handling is not used for control flow or to correct data-input mistakes.
an eiffel exception handler is defined using the rescue keyword. within the rescue section, the retry keyword executes the routine again. for example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:
connect_to_server (server: socket)
this example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. for most programs a routine name like attempt_connecting_to_server would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.
a number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as eiffelnet and eiffelthreads. a concurrency model for eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is scoop, or "simple concurrent object-oriented programming", not yet part of the official language definition but available in eiffelstudio.
cameo is an (unimplemented) variation of scoop for eiffel.
concurrency also interacts with exceptions. asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).
eiffel's view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the "target". so for example an addition such as
a + b
is conceptually understood as if it were the method call
a.plus (b)
with target codice_59, feature codice_99 and argument codice_100.
of course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in codice_2, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):
plus alias "+" (other: integer): integer
the range of operators that can be used as "alias" is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as "+" but also "free operators" made of non-alphanumeric symbols. this makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.
every class may in addition have "one" function aliased to "[]", the "bracket" operator, allowing the notation codice_102 as a synonym for codice_103 where codice_104 is the chosen function. this is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. for example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written
"assigner commands" are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call "setter" procedures. an assignment proper can never be of the form codice_105 as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). for example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure
item alias "[]" (key: string): element [3]
put (e: element; key: string)
then to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:
it is possible to write this equivalently as
(in the same way that codice_106 is a synonym for codice_107), provided the declaration of codice_108 now starts (replacement for [3]) with
this declares codice_109 as the assigner command associated with codice_108 and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (it could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as codice_111.
note: the argument list of a's assigner is constrained to be: (a's return type;all of a's argument list...)
eiffel is not case-sensitive. the tokens codice_7, codice_113 and codice_114 all denote the same identifier. see, however, the "style rules" below.
comments are introduced by codice_115 (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.
the semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. this results in less clutter on the program page.
there is no nesting of feature and class declarations. as a result, the structure of an eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.
it is customary to group features into separate "feature clauses" for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:
class hash_table [element, key -> hashable] inherit table [element]
end
in contrast to most curly bracket programming languages, eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. this is in line with the command-query separation principle of the eiffel method.
much of the documentation of eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.
while the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (codice_116), all-lower-case for feature names (codice_7), and initial capitals for constants (codice_118). the recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in codice_119.
the specification of eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in "codice_120", comments, operators, and punctuation marks in codice_121, with program text in codice_122 as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. for example, the "hello, world!" program given above would be rendered as below in eiffel documentation:
class
create
feature
end
eiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an open architecture for interfacing with "external" software in any other programming language.
it is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in c. eiffel provides a straightforward interface to c routines, including support for "inline c" (writing the body of an eiffel routine in c, typically for short machine-level operations).
although there is no direct connection between eiffel and c, many eiffel compilers (visual eiffel is one exception) output c source code as an intermediate language, to submit to a c compiler, for optimizing and portability. as such, they are examples of transcompilers. the eiffel compiler tecomp can execute eiffel code directly (like an interpreter) without going via an intermediate c code or emit c code which will be passed to a c compiler in order to obtain optimized native code. on .net, the eiffelstudio compiler directly generates cil (common intermediate language) code. the smarteiffel compiler can also output java bytecode.

ezra (; , '; fl. 480–440 bce), also called ezra the scribe (, ') and ezra the priest in the book of ezra, was a jewish scribe ("sofer") and priest ("kohen"). in greco-latin ezra is called esdras (). according to the hebrew bible he was a descendant of sraya () the last high priest to serve in the first temple (), and a close relative of joshua the first high priest of the second temple ( cjb and similar translations only; see also ). he returned from babylonian exile and reintroduced the torah in jerusalem ( and ). according to 1 esdras, a greek translation of the book of ezra still in use in eastern orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood.
several traditions have developed over his place of burial. one tradition says that he is buried in al-uzayr near basra (iraq), while another tradition alleges that he is buried in tadif near aleppo, in northern syria.
his name may be an abbreviation of ', "yah helps". in the greek septuagint the name is rendered ' (), from which the latin name comes.
the book of ezra describes how he led a group of judean exiles living in babylon to their home city of jerusalem () where he is said to have enforced observance of the torah. he was described as exhorting the israelite people to be sure to follow the torah law so as not to intermarry with people of particular different religions, a set of commandments described in the pentateuch.
ezra, known as "ezra the scribe" in chazalic literature, is a highly respected figure in judaism.
the canonical book of ezra and book of nehemiah are the oldest sources for the activity of ezra, whereas many of the other books ascribed to ezra (first esdras, 3–6 ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of ezra and nehemiah.
the book of ezra–nehemiah was always written as one scroll. in late medieval christian bibles, the single book was divided in two, as first and second ezra; and this division became jewish practice in the first printed hebrew bibles. modern hebrew bibles call the two books ezra and nehemiah, as do other modern bible translations. a few parts of the book of ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12–26) were written in aramaic, and the majority in hebrew, ezra himself being skilled in both languages. ezra was living in babylon when in the seventh year bce) of artaxerxes, king of persia, the king sent him to jerusalem to teach the laws of god to any who did not know them. ezra led a large body of exiles back to jerusalem, where he discovered that jewish men had been marrying non-jewish women. he tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of israel before god, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. some years later artaxerxes sent nehemiah (a jewish noble in his personal service) to jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. once this task was completed nehemiah had ezra read the law of moses (the torah) to the assembled israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.
1 esdras, probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries bce, preserves a greek text of ezra and a part of nehemiah distinctly different from that of ezra–nehemiah – in particular it eliminates nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. scholars are divided on whether it is based on ezra–nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of ezra and nehemiah accounts.
the first-century jewish historian josephus deals with ezra in his "antiquities of the jews". he uses the name xerxes for artaxerxes i reserving the name artaxerxes for the later artaxerxes ii whom he identifies as the ahasuerus of esther, thus placing ezra before the events of the book of esther. josephus's account of the deeds of ezra derives entirely from 1 esdras, which he cites as the 'book of ezra' in his numeration of the hebrew bible. contrariwise, josephus does not appear to recognise ezra-nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of nehemiah.
the apocalyptic fourth book of ezra (also sometimes called the 'second book of esdras' or the 'third book of esdras') was written c. ce 100, probably in hebrew-aramaic, but now survives in latin, slavonic and ethiopic. it was one of the most important sources for jewish theology at the end of the 1st century. in this book, ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an angel of god three times and has four visions. ezra, thirty years into the babylonian exile (4 ezra 3:1 / 2 esdras 1:1), recounts the siege of jerusalem and the destruction of solomon's temple. this would place these revelations in the year 557 bce, a full century before the date given in the canonical ezra. the central theological themes are "the question of theodicy, god's justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms, the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on earth of the heavenly jerusalem, the messianic period, at the end of which the messiah will die, the end of this world and the coming of the next, and the last judgment." ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the temple in jerusalem. he dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the hebrew bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works). at the end, he is taken up to heaven like enoch and elijah. ezra is seen as a new moses in this book.
there is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the "greek apocalypse of ezra".
traditionally judaism credits ezra with establishing the great assembly of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. the great assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional judaism in something like their present form, including torah reading, the amidah, and celebration of the feast of purim.
in rabbinic traditions, ezra is metaphorically referred to as the "flowers that appear on the earth" signifying the springtime in the national history of judaism. a disciple of baruch ben neriah, he favored study of the law over the reconstruction of the temple and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to jerusalem in the reign of cyrus. according to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with jeshua ben jozadak for the office of chief priest.
according to jewish tradition, ezra was the writer of the books of chronicles, and is the same prophet known also as malachi. there is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not ezra had served as kohen gadol.
according to the babylonian talmud, ezra the scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders, which are as follows: 1) that the public come together to read from the scroll of the law on sabbath days during the time of the afternoon oblation (minchah), because of those travelling merchants who loiter in the closed shops in the street corners, and who may have missed the biblical lections that were read during the weekdays; 2) that the courts be opened throughout the jewish townships on mondays and thursdays; 3) that women do not wait beyond thursday to launder their clothes, because of the honor due to the sabbath day; 4) that men would accustom themselves to eat [cooked] garlic on the eve of the sabbath (believed to enhance love between a man and his wife); 5) that women would rise up early on friday mornings to bake bread, so that a piece of bread will be available for the poor; 6) that jewish women in every place be girded with a wide belt (waist band), whether from the front or from behind, out of modesty; 7) that jewish women, during their menses, wash and comb their hair three days prior to their purification in a ritual bath; 8) that the travelling merchants make regular rounds into the jewish townships because of the honor due to the daughters of israel; 9) that jewish women and/or girls, as a precautionary measure, be accustomed to conversing with one another while one of their party goes out to relieve herself in the outhouse; 10) that men who may have suffered a seminal emission (especially after accompanying with their wives) be required to immerse themselves in a ritual bath before being permitted to read from the scroll of the law.
in the syrian village of tedef, a synagogue said to be the place where ezra stopped over has been venerated by jews for centuries. another tradition locates his tomb near basra, iraq.
early christian writers occasionally cited ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. clement of alexandria in his "stromata" referred to ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 esdras. where early christian writers refer to the 'book of ezra' it is always the text of 1 esdras that is being cited. no early christian writer cites the book of ezra as a record of the deeds of ezra
in islam he is known as uzair (). he was mentioned in the qur'an. although he was not mentioned as one of the prophets of islam, he is considered as one of them by some muslim scholars, based on islamic traditions. his tomb at al-ʻuzair on the banks of the tigris near basra, iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local marsh arabs. many islamic scholars and modern western academics do not view uzair as "ezra"; for example professor gordon darnell newby associates uzair with enoch and metatron. on this timothy winter (abdal hakim murad) and gordon darnell newby associate uzair again with enoch (ancestor of noah) and by extension metatron the creator-angel or "lesser yahweh".
scholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of ezra and nehemiah. ezra came to jerusalem "in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king". the text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to artaxerxes i (465–424 bce) or to artaxerxes ii (404–359 bce). most scholars hold that ezra lived during the rule of artaxerxes i, though some have difficulties with this assumption: nehemiah and ezra "seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap", however, in nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony. so, they clearly were contemporaries working together in jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint.;." these difficulties have led many scholars to assume that ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of artaxerxes ii, i.e. some 50 years after nehemiah. this assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. the last group of scholars regard "the seventh year" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.
mary joan winn leith in "the oxford history of the biblical world" believes that ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture and given a theological buildup. gosta w. ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that ezra, with his central position as the 'father of judaism' in the jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. those who argue against the historicity of ezra argue that the presentation style of ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of moses. there are also similarities between ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and joshua and zerubbabel on the other hand. the early 2nd-century bce jewish author ben sira praises nehemiah, but makes no mention of ezra.
richard friedman argued in his book "who wrote the bible?" (p. 232 1997 edition) that ezra is the one who redacted the torah, and in fact effectively produced the first torah. it has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the torah together.

elijah (; ; , meaning "my god is yahweh/yhwh") or latinized form elias ( ) was, according to the books of kings in the hebrew bible, a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of israel during the reign of king ahab (9th century bc). in 1 kings 18, elijah defended the worship of the hebrew god over that of the canaanite deity baal. god also performed many miracles through elijah, including resurrection (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and entering heaven alive "by fire". he is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as "the sons of the prophets". following his ascension, elisha, his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school. the book of malachi prophesies elijah's return "before the coming of the great and terrible day of the ", making him a harbinger of the messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the hebrew bible. references to elijah appear in ecclesiasticus, the new testament, the mishnah and talmud, the quran, the book of mormon, the doctrine and covenants, and bahá'í writings.
in judaism, elijah's name is invoked at the weekly havdalah rite that marks the end of shabbat, and elijah is invoked in other jewish customs, among them the passover seder and the brit milah (ritual circumcision). he appears in numerous stories and references in the haggadah and rabbinic literature, including the babylonian talmud.
the christian new testament notes that some people thought that jesus was, in some sense, elijah. but jesus makes it clear that john the baptist is "the elijah" who was promised to come in malachi 3:1 in the septuagint (malachi 4:5). christian doctrine says that elijah appeared with moses during the transfiguration of jesus.
in islam, elijah appears in the quran as a prophet and messenger of god, where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of baal is recounted in a concise form. due to his importance to muslims, catholics and orthodox christians, elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of bosnia and herzegovina since 1752.
according to the bible, by the 9th century bc, the kingdom of israel, once united under solomon, was divided into the northern kingdom of israel and southern kingdom of judah, which retained the historical capital of jerusalem along with its temple. however, scholars today are divided as to whether the united kingdom under solomon ever existed. omri, king of israel, continued policies dating from the reign of jeroboam, contrary to religious law, that were intended to reorient religious focus away from jerusalem: encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices, appointing priests from outside the family of the levites, and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to baal, an important deity in ancient canaanite religion. omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son ahab and princess jezebel, a priestess of baal and the daughter of the king of sidon in phoenicia. these solutions brought security and economic prosperity to israel for a time, but did not bring peace with the israelite prophets, who were interested in a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law.
under ahab's kingship, these tensions were exacerbated. ahab built a temple for baal, and his wife jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of baal and asherah into the country. it is in this context that elijah is introduced in as elijah "the tishbite". he warns ahab that there will be years of catastrophic drought so severe that not even dew will form, because ahab and his queen stand at the end of a line of kings of israel who are said to have "done evil in the sight of the lord."
no background for the person of elijah is given except for his brief description as being a "tishbite." his name in hebrew means "my god is yahweh", and may be a title applied to him because of his challenge to worship of baal.
as told in the hebrew bible, elijah's challenge is bold and direct. baal was the canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.
elijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges baal on behalf of god himself, but he also challenges jezebel, her priests, ahab and the people of israel.
after elijah's confrontation with ahab, god tells him to flee out of israel, to a hiding place by the brook chorath, east of the jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. when the brook dries up, god sends him to a widow living in the town of zarephath in phoenicia. when elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. elijah tells her that god will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, "do not be afraid...for thus says the lord the god of israel: the jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the lord sends rain on the earth." she feeds him the last of their food, and elijah's promise miraculously comes true. god gave her "manna" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land. some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, "you have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!" elijah prays that god might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of god's word might be demonstrated. 1 kings 17:22 relates how god "listened to the voice of elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived." this is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in scripture. this widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. the widow cried, "the word of the lord in your mouth is truth."
after more than three years of drought and famine, god tells elijah to return to ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in israel but by the command of the lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. while on his way, elijah meets obadiah, the head of ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred jewish prophets from jezebel's violent purge. obadiah fears that when he reports to ahab about elijah's whereabouts, elijah would disappear, provoking ahab to execute him. elijah reassures obadiah and sends him to ahab.
when ahab confronts elijah, he denounces him as being the "troubler of israel" but elijah takes notice of his hypocrisy and tells ahab that he is the one who troubled israel by allowing the worship of false gods. elijah then berates both the people of israel and ahab for their acquiescence in baal worship. "how long will you go limping with two different opinions? if the lord is god, follow him; but if baal, then follow him." and the people were silent. the hebrew for this word, "go limping" or "waver", is the same as that used for "danced" in 1 kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of baal frantically dance. elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of israel.
elijah proposes a direct test of the powers of baal and the jewish god. the people of israel, 450 prophets of baal, and 400 prophets of asherah are summoned to mount carmel. an altar is built for baal. wood is laid on the altar. an ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. elijah then invites the priests of baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. they pray from morning to noon without success. elijah ridicules their efforts. "at noon elijah mocked them, saying, 'cry aloud! surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'" they respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the mosaic law). they continue praying until evening without success.
elijah builds an altar from twelve stones, he digs a huge trench around it, he lays the wood on it, slaughters the ox cuts it up and lays it on the wood, he now orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from "four large jars" poured three times, filling also the trench. he asks god to accept the sacrifice. fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of baal. elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.
jezebel, enraged that elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill elijah. later elijah would prophesize about jezebel's death, because of her sin. elijah flees to beersheba in judah, continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. he falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the lord touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. when he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. he eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. the angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.
elijah travels for forty days and forty nights to mount horeb, where moses had received the ten commandments. elijah is the only person described in the bible as returning to horeb, after moses and his generation had left horeb several centuries before. he seeks shelter in a cave. god again speaks to elijah: "what doest thou here, elijah?". elijah did not give a direct answer to the lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. unlike moses, who tried to defend israel when they sinned with the golden calf, elijah bitterly complains over the israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the "only one left". up until this time elijah has only the word of god to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and "stand before the lord." a terrible wind passes, but god is not in the wind. a great earthquake shakes the mountain, but god is not in the earthquake. then a fire passes the mountain, but god is not in the fire. then a "still small voice" comes to elijah and asks again, "what doest thou here, elijah?" elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. god then sends him out again, this time to damascus to anoint hazael as king of aram, jehu as king of israel, and elisha as his replacement.
elijah encounters ahab again in , after ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. ahab desires to have the vineyard of naboth of jezreel. he offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. but naboth tells ahab that god has told him not to part with the land. ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. she sends letters, in ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near naboth. they are to arrange a feast and invite naboth. at the feast, false charges of cursing god and ahab are to be made against him. the plot is carried out and naboth is stoned to death. when word comes that naboth is dead, jezebel tells ahab to take possession of the vineyard.
god again speaks to elijah and sends him to confront ahab with a question and a prophecy: "have you killed, and also taken possession?" and, "in the place where dogs licked up the blood of naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood." ahab begins the confrontation by calling elijah his enemy. elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of god by his own actions. elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that jezebel will be eaten by dogs within jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). when ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that god relents in punishing ahab but will punish jezebel and their son: ahaziah.
elijah's story continues now from ahab to an encounter with ahaziah. the scene opens with ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. he sends to the priests of baalzebub in ekron, outside the kingdom of israel, to know if he will recover. elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to ahaziah with a message "is it because there is no god in israel that you are sending to inquire of baal-zebub, the god of ekron?" ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. they tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as elijah the tishbite.
ahaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest elijah. the first two are destroyed by fire which elijah calls down from heaven. the leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. elijah agrees to accompany this third group to ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with elijah's word.
according to , elisha (eliseus) and "the sons of the prophets" knew beforehand that elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. elisha asked elijah to "let a double portion" of elijah's "spirit" be upon him. elijah agreed, with the condition that elisha would see him be "taken".
elijah, in company with elisha, approaches the jordan. he rolls up his mantle and strikes the water. the water immediately divides and elijah and elisha cross on dry land. suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. as elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and elisha picks it up.
elijah is mentioned once more in , which will be his final mention in the hebrew bible. a letter is sent under the prophet's name to jehoram of judah. it tells him that he has led the people of judah astray in the same way that israel was led astray. the prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death. this letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. first, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of israel. second, the message begins with "thus says yhvh, god of your father david..." rather than the more usual "...in the name of yhvh the god of israel." also, this letter seems to come after elijah's ascension into the whirlwind. michael wilcock, formerly of trinity college, bristol, suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet. john van seters, however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the elijah tradition. however, wilcock argues that elijah's letter, 'does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom', and thus is authentic.
while the final mention of elijah in the hebrew bible is in the book of chronicles, the christian bible's ordering of the books of the septuagint places the book of malachi, which prophesies a messiah, before the gospels and means that elijah's final old testament appearance is in the book of malachi, where it is written, "lo, i will send you the prophet elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord comes." that day is described as the burning of a great furnace, "... so that it will leave them neither root nor branch." in christianity it is traditionally believed that elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of jesus fulfilled this prophecy. moreover, in the gospel of matthew, jesus identifies john the baptist as the spiritual successor to elijah: "and if you are willing to accept it, he is elijah who is to come." members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints believe that elijah visited earth at the dedication of the kirtland temple.
according to susanne otto, the elijah stories were added to the deuteronomistic history in four stages. the first stage dates from the final edition of the history, about 560 bc, when the three stories of naboth's vineyard, the death of ahaziah, and the story of jehu's coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of god's word and the cycle of baal worship and religious reform in the history of the northern kingdom. the narratives about the omride wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards god determines the fate of israel. according to otto, was added in early post-exilic times (after 538 bc) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with god after the time of judgment. additionally, otto suggests that in the fifth century bc, and the remaining elisha stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of israel. the foregoing otto analysis is heavily disputed amongst biblical scholars.
jewish legends about elijah abound in the aggadah, which is found throughout various collections of rabbinic literature, including the babylonian talmud. this varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death or "translation" ends only with the close of the history of the human race. the volume of references to elijah in jewish tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. as in the case of most figures of jewish legend, so in the case of elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. elijah the precursor of the messiah, elijah zealous in the cause of god, elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the elijah legends. his career is extensive, colorful, and varied. he has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.
from the time of malachi, who says of elijah that god will send him before "the great and dreadful day" (mal. 3:23), down to the later stories of the chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the jewish consciousness with elijah.
three different theories regarding elijah's origin are presented in the aggadah literature:
(1) he belonged to the tribe of gad,
(2) he was a benjamite from jerusalem, identical with the elijah mentioned in i chronicles 8:27, and
(3) he was a priest.
many christian church fathers also have stated that elijah was a priest. some rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with phinehas.
according to later kabbalistic literature, elijah was really an angel in human form, so that he had neither parents nor offspring.
the midrash rabbah exodus 4:2 states "elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the zarephathite" indicating he surely had parents.
the talmud states "said he [rabbah] to him (elijah): art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?"
in spite of elijah's many miracles, the mass of the jewish people remained as godless as before. a midrash tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as israel's accuser before god.
in the same cave where god once appeared to moses and revealed himself as gracious and merciful, elijah was summoned to appear before god. by this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to god's mercy, instead of becoming israel's accuser. the prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that god commanded him to appoint his successor.
the vision in which god revealed himself to elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through "four worlds." this world was shown to the prophet by god through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.
three years after this vision, elijah was "translated." concerning the place to which elijah was transferred, opinions differ among jews and christians, but the old view was that elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.
but as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by christian theologians, the assertion was made that elijah never entered into heaven proper. in later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of elijah, but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.
in the wisdom of jesus ben sira () his tasks are altered to: 1) herald the eschaton, 2) calm god's fury, 3) restore familial peace, and 4) restore the 12 tribes.
at jewish circumcision ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet elijah. elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child. this custom stems from the incident at mount horeb (): elijah had arrived at mount horeb after the demonstration of god's presence and power on mount carmel. () god asks elijah to explain his arrival, and elijah replies: "i have been very jealous for the lord, the god of hosts; for the people of israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and i, even i only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away" (). according to rabbinic tradition, elijah's words were patently untrue ( and ), and since elijah accused israel of failing to uphold the covenant, god would require elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.
in the talmudic literature, elijah would visit rabbis to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. malachi had cited elijah as the harbinger of the eschaton. thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision "until elijah comes."
one such decision was whether the passover seder required four or five cups of wine. each serving of wine corresponds to one of the "four expressions of redemption" in the book of exodus:
i am the lord, and "i will bring you out" from under the burdens of the egyptians, and "i will deliver you" from their bondage, and "i will redeem you" with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and "i will take you" for my people, and i will be your god; and you shall know that i am the lord your god, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the egyptians" ().
the next verse, "and "i will bring you" into the land which i swore to give to abraham, to isaac, and to jacob; i will give it to you for a possession. i am the lord." () was not fulfilled until the generation following the passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). thus, a cup was left for the arrival of elijah.
in practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for elijah. during the seder, the door of the house is opened and elijah is invited in. traditionally, the cup is viewed as elijah's and is used for no other purpose.
havdalah is the ceremony that concludes the sabbath day (saturday evening in jewish tradition). as part of the concluding hymn, an appeal is made to god that elijah will come during the following week. "elijah the prophet, elijah the tishbite. let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of david."
the volume of references to elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. louis ginzberg equates him with phinehas the grandson of aaron (). because of phinehas' zealousness for god, he and his descendants were promised, "a covenant of lasting priesthood" (). therefore, elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. elijah is also equated with the archangel sandalphon, whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. when forced to choose between death and dishonor, rabbi kahana chose to leap to his death. before he could strike the ground, elijah/sandalphon had appeared to catch him. yet another name for elijah is "angel of the covenant"
references to elijah in jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. it is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because elijah is in the neighborhood) to lengthy parables on the nature of god's justice.
one such story is that of rabbi joshua ben levi. the rabbi, a friend of elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. the rabbi answered only that he be able to join elijah in his wanderings. elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. he agreed and they began their journey. the first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. the old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. the next morning, as the travelers left, elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. the second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. he had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. as they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. they were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. when they left, elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.
finally, they came to a very poor synagogue. here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. when they left, elijah prayed that god might give them a single wise leader. at this rabbi joshua could no longer hold back. he demanded of elijah an explanation of his actions. at the house of the old couple, elijah knew that the angel of death was coming for the old woman. so he prayed that god might have the angel take the cow instead. at the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. the story ends with a moral: a synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. a town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. "know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not god is unjust."
the elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. the case of rabbi eliezer son of rabbi simon ben yohai is illustrative. once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. the man greeted him courteously, "peace be with thee, rabbi." instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, "how ugly you are! is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?" elijah responded with, "i don't know. perhaps you should tell the master architect how ugly is this, his construction." the rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. but elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.
elijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. this was found in the person of lilith. lilith in legend was the first wife of adam. she rebelled against adam, the angels, and even god. she came to be seen as a demon and a witch.
elijah encountered lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, "unclean one, where are you going?" unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.
elijah pronounced his malediction, "i curse you in the name of the lord. be silent as a stone!" but, lilith was able to make a bargain with elijah. she promises to "forsake my evil ways" if elijah will remove his curse. to seal the bargain she gives elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. lilith promises, "where i see those names, i shall run away at once. neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me."
in the new testament, jesus would say for those who believed, john the baptist was elijah, who would come before the "great and terrible day" as predicted by malachi.
some english translations of the new testament use elias, a latin form of the name. in the king james version, "elias" appears only in the texts translated from greek.
john the baptist preached a message of repentance and baptism. he predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of malachi. he also preached that the messiah was coming. all of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of elijah to his audience. he wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle (, ). he also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the jordan river.
in the gospel of john, when john the baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) "art thou elias", he replied "i am not" (). and however, make it clear that john was the spiritual successor to elijah. in the nativity of st. john the baptist in luke, gabriel appears to zechariah, john's father, and told him that john "will turn many of the sons of israel to the lord their god," and that he will go forth "in the spirit and power of elijah" ().
in the gospel of luke, herod antipas hears some of the stories surrounding jesus christ. some tell herod that jesus is john the baptist (whom herod had executed) come back to life. others tell him that jesus is elijah. later in the same gospel, jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. the apostles' answer includes elijah among others.
however jesus' ministry had little in common with that of elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while elijah killed his. miracle stories similar to those of elijah were associated with jesus (e. g. raising of the dead, miraculous feeding). jesus implicitly separates himself from elijah when he rebukes james and john for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming samaritan village in a similar manner to elijah. likewise, jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas elijah permitted this of his replacement elisha.
during jesus' crucifixion, some of the onlookers wonder if elijah will come to rescue him, as by the time of jesus, elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of jews in distress.
elijah makes an appearance in the new testament during an incident known as the transfiguration.
at the summit of an unnamed mount, jesus' face begins to shine. the disciples who are with him hear the voice of god announce that jesus is "my beloved son." the disciples also see moses and elijah appear and talk with jesus. peter is so struck by the experience that he asks jesus if they should build three "tabernacles": one for elijah, one for jesus and one for moses.
there is agreement among some christian theologians that elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to jesus as the woman by the well said to jesus (john 4:19) "i perceive thou art a prophet." moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced son of god.
elijah is mentioned four more times in the new testament: in luke, romans, hebrews, and james. in , jesus uses elijah as an example of rejected prophets. jesus says, "no prophet is accepted in his own country," and then mentions elijah, saying that there were many widows in israel, but elijah was sent to one in phoenicia. in , paul cites elijah as an example of god's never forsaking his people (the israelites). ("women received their dead raised to life again...") refers to both elijah raising the son of the widow of zarephath and elisha raising the son of the woman of shunem, citing both elijah and elisha as old testament examples of faith. in , james says, "the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," and then cites elijah's prayers which started and ended the famine in israel as examples.
in western christianity, the prophet elijah is commemorated as a saint with a feast day on 20 july by the roman catholic church and the lutheran church–missouri synod. catholics believe that he was unmarried and celibate.
in the eastern orthodox church and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite, he is commemorated on the same date (in the 21st century, julian calendar 20 july corresponds to gregorian calendar 2 august). he is greatly revered among the orthodox as a model of the contemplative life. he is also commemorated on the orthodox liturgical calendar on the sunday of the holy fathers (the sunday before the nativity of the lord).
elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of bosnia and herzegovina since 26 august 1752, replacing george of lydda at the request of bishop pavao dragičević. the reasons for the replacement are unclear. it has been suggested that elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in bosnia and herzegovina—catholics, muslims and orthodox christians. pope benedict xiv is said to have approved bishop dragičević's request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron.
elijah is revered as the spiritual father and traditional founder of the catholic religious order of carmelites. in addition to taking their name from mt. carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the calced carmelite and discalced carmelite traditions pertaining to elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life. the medieval carmelite book of the first monks offers some insight into the heart of the orders' contemplative vocation and reverence for the prophet.
in the 17th century the bollandist society, whose declared aim was to search out and classify materials concerning the saints venerated by the church, and to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information entered into controversy with the carmelites on this point. in writing of st. albert, patriarch of jerusalem and author of the carmelite rule, the bollandist daniel papebroch stated that the attribution of carmelite origin to elijah was insufficiently grounded. the carmelites reacted strongly. from 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. the carmelites were supported by a spanish tribunal, while the bollandists had the support of jean de launoy and the sorbonne. in november 1698, pope innocent xii ordered an end to the controversy.
since most eastern churches either use greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the greek, "elias" (or its modern iotacized form "ilias") is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the eastern orthodox church and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite.
the feast day of saint elias falls on july 20 of the orthodox liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar, july 20 currently falls on august 2 of the modern gregorian calendar). this day is a major holiday in lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. the full name of st. elias in lebanon translates to st. elias the living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. the reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.
elias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the old testament, on the sunday of the holy fathers (the sunday before the nativity of the lord).
the apolytikion in the fourth tone for st. elias:
the incarnate angel, the cornerstone of the prophets, the second forerunner of the coming of christ, the glorious elias, who from above, sent down to elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.
the kontakion in the second tone for st. elias:
o prophet and foreseer of the great works of god, o greatly renowned elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only loving one.
starting in the fifth century, elias is often connected with helios, the sun. the two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical greek; elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven () just as helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the holocaust sacrifice offered by elijah and burned by fire from heaven () corresponds to the sun warming the earth.
sedulius writes poetically in the fifth century that the "bright path to glittering heaven" suits elias both "in merits and name", as changing one letter makes his name "helios"; but he does not identify the two. a homily entitled "de ascensione heliae", misattributed to chrysostom, claims that poets and painters use the ascension of elijah as a model for their depictions of the sun, and says that "elijah is really helios". saint patrick appears to conflate helios and elias. in modern times, much greek folklore also connects elias with the sun.
in greece, chapels and monasteries dedicated to prophet elias (προφήτης ηλίας) are often found on mountaintops, which themselves are often named after him. since wachsmuth (1864), the usual explanation for this has been that elias was identified with helios, who had mountaintop shrines. but few shrines of helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by apollo-worship by christian times, and so could not be confused with elias. the modern folklore is not good evidence for the "origin" of the association of the sun, elias, and mountaintops. perhaps elias is simply a "natural patron of high places".
the association of elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with zeus, especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind. when elias prevailed over the priests of baal, it was on mount carmel (), which later became known as mount st. elias. when he spent forty days in a cave, it was on mount horeb (). when elias confronted ahab, he stopped the rains for three years ().
a map of mountain-cults of zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to elias, including mount olympus, mount lykaion, mount arachnaion, and mount taleton on the mainland, and mount kenaion, mount oche, and mount kynados in the islands. of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a helios cult is mount taleton.
elias is associated with pre-christian lightning gods in many other european traditions.
among albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. one such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 august pilgrimage to ljuboten on the sharr mountains. muslims refer to this day as "aligjyn" ("ali day"), and it is believed that ali becomes elias at midday.
as elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the christian missionaries who converted slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for perun, the supreme slavic god of storms, thunder and lightning bolts. in many slavic countries elijah is known as elijah the thunderer ("ilija gromovnik"), who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow, thus actually taking the place of perun in popular beliefs. perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero elijah of murom. the feast of st. elias is known as "ilinden" in south slavic, and was chosen as the day of the ilinden-preobrazhenie uprising in 1903; it is now the holiday of republic day in north macedonia.
in estonian folklore elijah is considered to be the successor of ukko, the lightning spirit.
in georgian mythology, he replaces elwa. a georgian story about elijah:
once jesus, the prophet elijah, and st. george were going through georgia. when they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. they saw a georgian shepherd and decided to ask him to feed them. first, elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. after the shepherd asked his identity elijah said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. the shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (after elijah, jesus and st. george attempt to get help and eventually succeed).
elias has other pagan associations: a modern legend about elias mirrors precisely the legend of odysseus seeking a place where the locals would not recognize an oar—hence the mountaintops.
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints acknowledges elijah as a prophet. the church teaches that the malachi prophecy of the return of elijah was fulfilled on april 3, 1836, when elijah visited the prophet and founder of the church, joseph smith, along with oliver cowdery, in the kirtland temple as a resurrected being. this event is chronicled in . this experience forms the basis for the church's focus on genealogy and family history and belief in the eternal nature of marriage and families.
in latter-day saint theology, the name-title elias is not always synonymous with elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet. according to joseph smith,
the spirit of elias is first, elijah second, and messiah last. elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of elijah is to come after, holding the keys of power, building the temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the melchizedek priesthood upon the house of israel, and making all things ready; then messiah comes to his temple, which is last of all.
people to whom the title elias is applied in mormonism include noah, the angel gabriel (who is considered to be the same person as noah in mormon doctrine), elijah, john the baptist, john the apostle, and an unspecified man who was a contemporary of abraham.
detractors of mormonism have often alleged that smith, in whose time and place the king james version was the only available english translation of the bible, simply failed to grasp the fact that the elijah of the old testament and the elias of the new testament are the same person. latter-day saints deny this and say that the difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic. the names elias and elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the lord. this is applicable to john the baptist coming to prepare the way for the lord and his baptism; it also refers to elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for jesus by restoring keys of sealing power. jesus then gave this power to the twelve saying, "verily i say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
elijah ( or ; "ilyas" or "ilya") is also mentioned as a prophet in the qur'an, al-an'am 85. elijah's narrative in the qur'an and later muslim tradition resembles closely that in the hebrew bible and muslim literature records elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of ahab and jezebel as well as ahaziah. he is seen by muslims to be the prophetic predecessor to elisha. while neither the bible nor the qur'an mentions the genealogy of elijah, some scholars of islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet aaron. elijah is rarely associated with islamic eschatology and islam views jesus as the messiah. however, elijah is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure known as khidr during the last judgment. elijah's figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints, including idris, which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for elijah, and khidr. islamic legend later developed the figure of elijah, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave elijah the status of a half-human, half-angel. elijah also appears in later works of literature, including the "hamzanama".
elijah is mentioned in the quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. the quran narrates that elijah told his people to come to the worship of god and to leave the worship of baal, the primary idol of the area. the quran states, "verily elijah was one of the apostles. when he said to his people: "will you not fear god? "will ye call upon ba'al and leave the best of creators, god, your and cherisher and the and cherisher of your fathers of old?" as-saaffat 123–126
the quran makes it clear that the majority of elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. however, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of god among them followed elijah and believed in and worshiped god. the quran states, "they denied him (elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, except the sincere and devoted servants of god (among them). and we left his (memory) for posterity." as-saaffat 127–128
in the quran, god praises elijah in two places:
numerous commentators, including abdullah yusuf ali, have offered commentary on vi: 85 saying that elijah, zechariah, john the baptist and jesus were all spiritually connected. abdullah yusuf ali says, "the third group consists not of men of action, but preachers of truth, who led solitary lives. their epithet is: "the righteous." they form a connected group round jesus. zachariah was the father of john the baptist, who is referenced as "elias, which was for to come" (matt 11:14); and elias is said to have been present and talked to jesus at the transfiguration on the mount (matt. 17:3)."
muslim literature and tradition recounts that elijah preached to the kingdom of israel, ruled over by ahab and later his son ahaziah. he is believed to have been a "prophet of the desert—like john the baptist". elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to ahab and his wife jezebel, who according to muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to elijah that elisha had to continue preaching the message of god to israel after him.
elijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with khidr, and in one legend, with muhammad himself. in islamic mysticism, elijah is associated closely with the sage khidr. one hadith reported that elijah and khidr met together every year in jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to mecca. elijah appears also in the "hamzanama" numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of khidr as well as one who drank from the fountain of youth.
further, it is narrated in kitab al-kafi that imam ja'far al-sadiq was reciting the prostration of ilyas (elijah) in the syrian language and began to weep. he then translated the supplication in arabic to a group of visiting scholars:
<poem>
"o lord, will i find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? will i find that you punish me although you know that i rub my face on earth to worship you? will i find that you punish me although you know that i give up sins for you? will i find that you punish me although you know that i stay awake all night just for you?" to which allah then inspired to ilyas, "raise your head from the earth for i will not punish you" .
</poem>
although most muslim scholars believed that elijah preached in israel, some early commentators on the qur'an stated that elijah was sent to baalbek, in lebanon. modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of "baal", which was the deity that elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. scholars who reject identification of elijah's town with baalbek further argue that the town of baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of elijah in either the qur'an or the hebrew bible.
in the bahá'í faith, the báb, founder of the bábí faith, is believed to be the return of elijah and john the baptist. both elijah and john the baptist are considered to be lesser prophets, whose stations are below that of a manifestation of god like jesus christ, buddha, the báb or bahá'u'lláh. the báb is buried on mount carmel, where elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of baal.
that "ravens" fed elijah by the brook chorath has been questioned. the hebrew text at uses the word "`ōrvīm", which means "ravens", but with a different vocalization might equally mean "arabs". the septuagint has , "ravens", and other traditional translations followed.
alternatives have been proposed for many years; for example adam clarke (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing. objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean (see ) as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. the parallelism with the incident that follows, where elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.
prof. john gray chooses "arabs", saying "we adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where elijah is fed by an alien phoenician woman." his translation of the verses in question is:
and the word of jehovah came to elijah saying, go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the wadi chorath east of the jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and i have commanded the arabs to feed thee there. and he went and did according to the word of jehovah and went and dwelt in the wadi chorath east of the jordan. and the arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.
the challenge to the priests of baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the god of israel was greater than baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain. according to j. robinson, "some scholars have suggested that the pouring of water was a piece of sympathetic magic."
hugo gressmann suggested that the fire that destroyed the offering and altar was lightning, while ferdinand hitzig and others thought the water poured on the sacrifice and into the ditch might have been flammable naphtha. baptist scholar h. h. rowley rejects both views. robinson dismisses the suggestion of naphtha with the view that the priests of baal would have been aware of the properties of naphtha. julian morgenstern rejects the idea of sympathetic magic, but supports the interpretation of white naphtha possibly ignited by a glass or mirror to focus the sun's rays, citing other mentions of sacred fire, as in 2 maccabees 1:18-22.
in the gospel of john, jesus says: "and no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, "[even]" the son of man which is in heaven." (john 3:13)
traditionally christianity interprets the "son of man" as a title of jesus, but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations. further interpreting this quote, some christians believe that elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven or with king jehoram of judah. the prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away, and not simply straight up ().
the question of whether elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter jehoram received from elijah in 2 chronicles 21 after elijah had ascended. some have suggested that the letter was written before elijah ascended, but only delivered later. the rabbinical seder olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension. this is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of josephus' "antiquities of the jews" when dealing with this issue. others have argued that elijah was only "caught away" such as philip in acts 8:39 john lightfoot reasoned that it must have been a different elijah.
elijah's name typically occurs in jewish lists of those who have entered heaven alive.
centuries after his departure the jewish nation awaits the coming of elijah to precede the coming of the messiah. for many christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the transfiguration alongside moses (). commentators have said that moses' appearance represented the law, while elijah's appearance represented the prophets.
the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints believes that elijah returned on april 3, 1836 in an appearance to joseph smith and oliver cowdery, fulfilling the prophecy in malachi.
the bahá'í faith believes elijah returned as the biblical prophet john the baptist and as the báb who founded the bábí faith in 1844.
the nation of islam believes elijah returned as elijah muhammad, black separatist religious leader (who claimed to be a "messenger", not a prophet). this is considered less important than their belief that allah himself showed up in the person of fard muhammad, the founder of the group. it differs notably from most beliefs about elijah, in that his re-appearance is usually the precursor to a greater one's appearance, rather than an afterthought.

expressive aphasia, also known as broca's aphasia, is a type of aphasia characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual, or written), although comprehension generally remains intact. a person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. speech generally includes important content words, but leaves out function words that have only grammatical significance and not real-world meaning, such as prepositions and articles. this is known as "telegraphic speech". the person's intended message may still be understood but his or her sentence will not be grammatically correct. in very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances. typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.
it is caused by acquired damage to the anterior regions of the brain, such as the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus or inferior frontal operculum, also described as broca's area (brodmann area 44 and brodmann area 45). it is one subset of a larger family of disorders known collectively as aphasia. expressive aphasia contrasts with receptive aphasia, in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance, and generally also have trouble with comprehension. expressive aphasia differs from dysarthria, which is typified by a patient's inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. expressive aphasia also differs from apraxia of speech which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for speech.
broca's (expressive) aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia in which an individual’s speech is halting and effortful. misarticulations or distortions of consonants and vowels, namely phonetic dissolution, are common. individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three. long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable. the prosody of a person with broca's aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies. intonation and stress patterns are also deficient.
for example, in the following passage, a patient with broca's aphasia is trying to explain how he came to the hospital for dental surgery and it may look like this:yes... ah... monday... er... dad and peter h... (his own name), and dad... er... hospital... and ah... wednesday... wednesday, nine o'clock... and oh... thursday... ten o'clock, ah doctors... two... an' doctors... and er... teeth... yah.the speech of a person with expressive aphasia contains mostly content words such as nouns, verbs, and some adjectives. however, function words like conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are rarely used except for “and” which is prevalent in the speech of most patients with aphasia. the omission of function words makes the person's speech agrammatic. a communication partner of a person with aphasia may say that the person's speech sounds telegraphic due to poor sentence construction and disjointed words. for example, a person with expressive aphasia might say "smart... university... smart... good... good..."
self-monitoring is typically well preserved in patients with broca's aphasia. they are usually aware of their communication deficits, and are more prone to depression and outbursts from frustration than are patients with other forms of aphasia.
in general, word comprehension is preserved, allowing patients to have functional receptive language skills. individuals with broca's aphasia understand most of the everyday conversation around them, but higher-level deficits in receptive language can occur. because comprehension is substantially impaired for more complex sentences, it is better to use simple language when speaking with an individual with expressive aphasia. this is exemplified by the difficulty to understand phrases or sentences with unusual structure. a typical patient with broca's aphasia will misinterpret "the man is bitten by the dog" by switching the subject and object to “the dog is bitten by the man.”
typically, people with expressive aphasia can understand speech and read better than they can produce speech and write. the person's writing will resemble his or her speech and will be effortful, lacking cohesion, and containing mostly content words. letters will likely be formed clumsily and distorted and some may even be omitted. although listening and reading are generally intact, subtle deficits in both reading and listening comprehension are almost always present during assessment of aphasia.
because broca's area is anterior to the primary motor cortex which is responsible for movement of the face, hands, and arms, a lesion affecting broca's areas may also result in hemiparesis (weakness of both limbs on the same side of the body) or hemiplegia (paralysis of both limbs on the same side of the body). the brain is wired contralaterally, which means the limbs on right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere and vice versa. therefore, when broca's area or surrounding areas in the left hemisphere are damaged, hemiplegia or hemiparesis often occurs on the right side of the body in individuals with broca's aphasia.
severity of expressive aphasia varies among patients. some people may only have mild deficits and detecting problems with their language may be difficult. in the most extreme cases, patients may be able to produce only a single word. even in such cases, over-learned and rote-learned speech patterns may be retained- for instance, some patients can count from one to ten, but cannot produce the same numbers in novel conversation.
in deaf patients who use manual language (such as american sign language), damage to the left hemisphere of the brain leads to disruptions in their signing ability. paraphasic errors similar to spoken language have been observed; whereas in spoken language a phonemic substitution would occur (e.g. "tagle" instead of "table"), in asl case studies errors in movement, hand position, and morphology have been noted. agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of american sign language who have left hemisphere damage. the lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather are a manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain. similar symptoms have been seen in a patient with left hemisphere damage whose first language was british sign language, further showing that damage to the left hemisphere primarily hinders linguistic ability, not motor ability. in contrast, patients who have damage to non-linguistic areas on the left hemisphere have been shown to be fluent in signing, but are unable to comprehend written language.
in addition to difficulty expressing oneself, individuals with expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly have trouble with comprehension in certain linguistic areas. this agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia. the most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic at the beginning of the sentence). these three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence. this is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many people with aphasia rely heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.
the most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke. a stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by thrombosis or embolism. some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients. expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.
in most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in broca's area or the surrounding vicinity. broca's area is in the lower part of the premotor cortex in the language dominant hemisphere and is responsible for planning motor speech movements. however, cases of expressive aphasia have been seen in patients with strokes in other areas of the brain. patients with classic symptoms of expressive aphasia in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as global aphasia or left unclassified.
expressive aphasia can also be caused by trauma to the brain, tumor, cerebral hemorrhageand by extradural abscess.
understanding lateralization of brain function is important for understanding which areas of the brain cause expressive aphasia when damaged. in the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. if this were true, damage to the homologous region of broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. more recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. however, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.
less common causes of expressive aphasia include primary autoimmune phenomenon and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a paraneoplastic syndrome) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits. many case reports exist describing paraneoplastic aphasia, and the reports that are specific tend to describe expressive aphasia. although most cases attempt to exclude micrometastasis, it is likely that some cases of paraneoplastic aphasia are actually extremely small metastasis to the vocal motor regions.
neurdegenerative diseases may present with aphasia. alzheimer's disease may present with either fluent aphasia or expressive aphasia. there are case reports of creutzfeldt-jakob disease presenting with expressive aphasia.
expressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia. diagnosis is done on a case by case basis, as lesions often affect the surrounding cortex and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.
a physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and computed tomography (ct) scans. the physician will complete a brief assessment of the patient's ability to understand and produce language. for further diagnostic testing, the physician will refer the patient to a speech-language pathologist, who will complete a comprehensive evaluation.
in order to diagnose a patient who is suffering from broca’s aphasia, there are certain commonly used tests and procedures. the western aphasia battery (wab) classifies individuals based on their scores on the subtests; spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. the boston diagnostic aphasia examination (bdae) can inform users what specific type of aphasia they may have, infer the location of lesion, and assess current language abilities. the porch index of communication ability (pica) can predict potential recovery outcomes of the patients with aphasia. quality of life measurement is also an important assessment tool. tests such as the assessment for living with aphasia (ala) and the satisfaction with life scale (swls) allow for therapists to target skills that are important and meaningful for the individual.
in addition to formal assessments, patient and family interviews are valid and important sources of information. the patient’s previous hobbies, interests, personality, and occupation are all factors that will not only impact therapy but may motivate them throughout the recovery process. patient interviews and observations allow professionals to learn the priorities of the patient and family and determine what the patient hopes to regain in therapy. observations of the patient may also be beneficial to determine where to begin treatment. the current behaviors and interactions of the patient will provide the therapist with more insight about the client and his or her individual needs. other information about the patient can be retrieved from medical records, patient referrals from physicians, and the nursing staff.
in non-speaking patients who use manual languages, diagnosis is often based on interviews from the patient's acquaintances, noting the differences in sign production pre- and post- damage to the brain. many of these patients will also begin to rely on non-linguistic gestures to communicate, rather than signing since their language production is hindered.
currently, there is no standard treatment for expressive aphasia. most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient's condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.
in the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases. mechanisms are also taught in traditional treatment to compensate for lost language function such as drawing and using phrases that are easier to pronounce.
emphasis is placed on establishing a basis for communication with family and caregivers in everyday life. treatment is individualized based on the patient's own priorities, along with the family's input.
a patient may have the option of individual or group treatment. although less common, group treatment has been shown to have advantageous outcomes. some types of group treatments include family counseling, maintenance groups, support groups and treatment groups.
melodic intonation therapy was inspired by the observation that individuals with non-fluent aphasia sometimes can sing words or phrases that they normally cannot speak. "melodic intonation therapy was begun as an attempt to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere in those with aphasia to help cue retrieval words and expressive language." it is believed that this is because singing capabilities are stored in the right hemisphere of the brain, which is likely to remain unaffected after a stroke in the left hemisphere. however, recent evidence demonstrates that the capability of individuals with aphasia to sing entire pieces of text may actually result from rhythmic features and the familiarity with the lyrics.
the goal of melodic intonation therapy is to utilize singing to access the language-capable regions in the right hemisphere and use these regions to compensate for lost function in the left hemisphere. the natural musical component of speech was used to engage the patients' ability to produce phrases. a clinical study revealed that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech. moreover, evidence from randomized controlled trials is still needed to confirm that melodic intonation therapy is suitable to improve propositional utterances and speech intelligibility in individuals with (chronic) non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.
melodic intonation therapy appears to work particularly well in patients who have had a unilateral, left hemisphere stroke, show poor articulation, are non-fluent or have severely restricted speech output, have moderately preserved auditory comprehension, and show good motivation. mit therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. at the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as "water" and "i love you") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. with increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. the patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.
fmri studies have shown that melodic intonation therapy (mit) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. in mit, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere. the interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. for example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as "thank you", "how are you?" or "i am fine." this type of phrases falls into the category of formulaic language and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.
a pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of mit to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain. a randomized controlled trial was conducted and the study reported benefits of utilizing modified mit treatment early in the recovery phase for people with nonfluent aphasia.
melodic intonation therapy is used by music therapists, board-certified professionals that use music as a therapeutic tool to effect certain non-musical outcomes in their patients. speech language pathologists can also use this therapy for individuals who have had a left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasias such as broca’s or even apraxia of speech.
constraint-induced aphasia therapy (ciat) is based on similar principles as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by dr. edward taub at the university of alabama at birmingham. constraint-induced movement therapy is based on the idea that a person with an impairment (physical or communicative) develops a "learned nonuse" by compensating for the lost function with other means such as using an unaffected limb by a paralyzed individual or drawing by a patient with aphasia. in constraint-induced movement therapy, the alternative limb is constrained with a glove or sling and the patient is forced to use the affected limb. in constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged ("constrained") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.
two important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions. these principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain. constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.
it is believed that ciat works by the mechanism of increased neuroplasticity. by constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.
the strongest results of ciat have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). studies of ciat have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a "plateau" period of recovery. it has also been proven that the benefits of ciat are retained long term. however, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy. recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.
in addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia. this area of study is relatively new and much research continues to be conducted.
the following drugs have been suggested for use in treating aphasia and their efficacy has been studied in control studies.
the most effect has been shown by piracetam and amphetamine, which may increase cerebral plasticity and result in an increased capability to improve language function. it has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. when used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.
bromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone. furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.
donepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.
no study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy. furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery. comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.
in transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified cortical regions. the procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. tms works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain. by suppressing the inhibition of neurons by external factors, the targeted area of the brain may be reactivated and thereby recruited to compensate for lost function. research has shown that patients can demonstrate increased object naming ability with regular transcranial magnetic stimulation than patients not receiving tms. furthermore, research suggests this improvement is sustained upon the completion of tms therapy. however, some patients fail to show any significant improvement from tms which indicates the need for further research of this treatment.
described as the linguistic approach to the treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences. sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. the simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. for example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with wh- sentences. "what" and "who" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. for instance, therapists have used sentences like, "who is the boy helping?" and "what is the boy fixing?" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. in addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. training "who" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained "who" sentences as well as untrained "what" sentences, and vice versa. likewise, "where" and "when" question types are very closely linked. "what" and "who" questions alter placement of arguments, and "where" and "when" sentences move adjunct phrases. training is in the style of: "the man parked the car in the driveway. what did the man park in the driveway?" sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.
results: patients’ use of sentence types used in the tuf treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in tuf, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others. generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fmri mappings. training of wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced. patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy. in terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.
mechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy. fmri studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area. it has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation. it is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a "dead-end" and can lead only to partial recovery.
it has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy. by comparing the length and intensity of various methods of therapies, it was proven that intensity is a better predictor of recovery than the method of therapy used.
in most individuals with expressive aphasia, the majority of recovery is seen within the first year following a stroke or injury. the majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter. however, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. on the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4–8 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.
numerous factors impact the recovery process and outcomes. site and extent of lesion greatly impacts recovery. other factors that may affect prognosis are age, education, gender, and motivation. occupation, handedness, personality, and emotional state may also be associated with recovery outcomes.
studies have also found that prognosis of expressive aphasia correlates strongly with the initial severity of impairment. however, it has been seen that continued recovery is possible years after a stroke with effective treatment. timing and intensity of treatment is another factor that impacts outcomes. research suggests that even in later stages of recovery, intervention is effective at improving function, as well as, preventing loss of function.
unlike receptive aphasia, patients with expressive aphasia are aware of their errors in language production. this may further motivate a person with expressive aphasia to progress in treatment, which would affect treatment outcomes. on the other hand, awareness of impairment may lead to higher levels of frustration, depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal, which have been proven to negatively affect a person's chance of recovery.
expressive aphasia was first identified by the french neurologist paul broca. by examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. one of the most important aspects of paul broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.
the discoveries of paul broca were made during the same period of time as the german neurologist carl wernicke, who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as wernicke's area. discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. while both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was carl wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and receptive aphasia).

ephesus (; "ephesos"; ; may ultimately derive from hittite "apasa") was an ancient greek city on the coast of ionia, three kilometres southwest of present-day selçuk in izmir province, turkey. it was built in the 10th century bc on the site of the former arzawan capital by attic and ionian greek colonists. during the classical greek era it was one of the twelve cities of the ionian league. the city flourished after it came under the control of the roman republic in 129 bc.
the city was famed for the nearby temple of artemis (completed around 550 bc), one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. among many other monumental buildings are the library of celsus, and a theatre capable of holding 25,000 spectators.
ephesos was one of the seven churches of asia that are cited in the book of revelation. the gospel of john may have been written here. the city was the site of several
5th-century christian councils (see council of ephesus).
the city was destroyed by the goths in 263, and although rebuilt, the city's importance as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the küçükmenderes river. it was partially destroyed by an earthquake in ad 614.
the ruins of ephesus are a favourite international and local tourist attraction, partly owing to their easy access from adnan menderes airport or from the cruise ship port of kuşadası, some 30 km to the south.
the area surrounding ephesus was already inhabited during the neolithic age (about 6000 bc), as was revealed by excavations at the nearby "höyük" (artificial mounds known as tells) of arvalya and cukurici.
excavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early bronze age at ayasuluk hill. according to hittite sources, the capital of the kingdom of arzawa (another independent state in western and southern anatolia/asia minor) was apasa (or "abasa"). some scholars suggest that this is the later greek ephesus. in 1954, a burial ground from the mycenaean era (1500–1400 bc) with ceramic pots was discovered close to the ruins of the basilica of st. john. this was the period of the mycenaean expansion when the "achaioi" (as they were called by homer) settled in asia minor during the 14th and 13th centuries bc. the names "apasa" and "ephesus" appear to be cognate, and recently found inscriptions seem to pinpoint the places in the hittite record.
ephesus was founded as an attic-ionian colony in the 10th century bc on a hill (now known as the ayasuluk hill), three kilometers () from the centre of ancient ephesus (as attested by excavations at the seljuk castle during the 1990s). the mythical founder of the city was a prince of athens named androklos, who had to leave his country after the death of his father, king kodros. according to the legend, he founded ephesus on the place where the oracle of delphi became reality ("a fish and a boar will show you the way"). androklos drove away most of the native carian and lelegian inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. he was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of ionia together into the ionian league. during his reign the city began to prosper. he died in a battle against the carians when he came to the aid of priene, another city of the ionian league. androklos and his dog are depicted on the hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century. later, greek historians such as pausanias, strabo and herodotos and the poet kallinos reassigned the city's mythological foundation to ephos, queen of the amazons.
the greek goddess artemis and the great anatolian goddess kybele were identified together as "artemis of ephesus". the many-breasted "lady of ephesus", identified with artemis, was venerated in the temple of artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world and the largest building of the ancient world according to pausanias (4.31.8). pausanias mentions that the temple was built by ephesus, son of the river god caystrus, before the arrival of the ionians. of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.
ancient sources seem to indicate that an older name of the place was alope ().
about 650 bc, ephesus was attacked by the cimmerians who razed the city, including the temple of artemis. after the cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. following a revolt by the people, ephesus was ruled by a council. the city prospered again under a new rule, producing a number of important historical figures such as the elegiac poet callinus and the iambic poet hipponax, the philosopher heraclitus, the great painter parrhasius and later the grammarian zenodotos and physicians soranus and rufus.
about 560 bc, ephesus was conquered by the lydians under king croesus, who, though a harsh ruler, treated the inhabitants with respect and even became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of artemis. his signature has been found on the base of one of the columns of the temple (now on display in the british museum). croesus made the populations of the different settlements around ephesus regroup ("synoikismos") in the vicinity of the temple of artemis, enlarging the city.
later in the same century, the lydians under croesus invaded persia. the ionians refused a peace offer from cyrus the great, siding with the lydians instead. after the persians defeated croesus, the ionians offered to make peace, but cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire. they were defeated by the persian army commander harpagos in 547 bc. the persians then incorporated the greek cities of asia minor into the achaemenid empire. those cities were then ruled by satraps.
ephesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the archaic period there is no definite location for the settlement. there are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the bronze age and the roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbours as well as the movement of the kayster river meant that the location never remained the same.
ephesus continued to prosper, but when taxes were raised under cambyses ii and darius, the ephesians participated in the ionian revolt against persian rule in the battle of ephesus (498 bc), an event which instigated the greco-persian wars. in 479 bc, the ionians, together with athens, were able to oust the persians from the shores of asia minor. in 478 bc, the ionian cities with athens entered into the delian league against the persians. ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support.
during the peloponnesian war, ephesus was first allied to athens but in a later phase, called the decelean war, or the ionian war, sided with sparta, which also had received the support of the persians. as a result, rule over the cities of ionia was ceded again to persia.
these wars did not greatly affect daily life in ephesus. the ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations: they allowed strangers to integrate and education was valued. in later times, pliny the elder mentioned having seen at ephesus a representation of the goddess diana by timarata, the daughter of a painter.
in 356 bc the temple of artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called herostratus. the inhabitants of ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.
when alexander the great defeated the persian forces at the battle of granicus in 334 bc, the greek cities of asia minor were liberated. the pro-persian tyrant syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and alexander was greeted warmly when he entered ephesus in triumph. when alexander saw that the temple of artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. but the inhabitants of ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. after alexander's death in 323 bc, ephesus in 290 bc came under the rule of one of alexander's generals, lysimachus.
as the river cayster (grk. name κάϋστρος) silted up the old harbour, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. lysimachus forced the people to move from the ancient settlement around the temple of artemis to the present site two kilometres () away, when as a last resort the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers. the new settlement was officially called "arsinoea" ( or ἀρσινοΐα) or arsinoe (ἀρσινόη), after the king's second wife, arsinoe ii of egypt. after lysimachus had destroyed the nearby cities of lebedos and colophon in 292 bc, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.
ephesus revolted after the treacherous death of agathocles, giving the hellenistic king of syria and mesopotamia seleucus i nicator an opportunity for removing and killing lysimachus, his last rival, at the battle of corupedium in 281 bc. after the death of lysimachus the town again was named ephesus.
thus ephesus became part of the seleucid empire. after the murder of king antiochus ii theos and his egyptian wife, pharaoh ptolemy iii invaded the seleucid empire and the egyptian fleet swept the coast of asia minor. ephesus came under egyptian rule between 263 and 197 bc.
the seleucid king antiochus iii the great tried to regain the greek cities of asia minor and recaptured ephesus in 196 bc but he then came into conflict with rome. after a series of battles, he was defeated by scipio asiaticus at the battle of magnesia in 190 bc. as a result of the subsequent treaty of apamea, ephesus came under the rule of eumenes ii, the attalid king of pergamon, (ruled 197–159 bc). when his grandson attalus iii died in 133 bc without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the roman republic, on condition that the city of pergamon is kept free and autonomous.

ephesus, as part of the kingdom of pergamon, became a subject of the roman republic in 129 bc after the revolt of eumenes iii was suppressed.
the city felt roman influence at once; taxes rose considerably, and the treasures of the city were systematically plundered. hence in 88 bc ephesus welcomed archelaus, a general of mithridates the great, king of pontus, when he conquered asia (the roman name for western asia minor). from ephesus, mithridates ordered every roman citizen in the province to be killed which led to the asiatic vespers, the slaughter of 80,000 roman citizens in asia, or any person who spoke with a latin accent. many had lived in ephesus, and statues and monument of roman citizens in ephesus were also destroyed. but when they saw how badly the people of chios had been treated by zenobius, a general of mithridates, they refused entry to his army. zenobius was invited into the city to visit philopoemen, the father of monime, the favourite wife of mithridates, and the overseer of ephesus. as the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. however, the greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. when mithridates was defeated in the first mithridatic war by the roman consul lucius cornelius sulla, ephesus came back under roman rule in 86 bc. sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.
king ptolemy xii auletes of egypt retired to ephesus in 57 bc, passing his time in the sanctuary of the temple of artemis when he failed to get restoration of his throne from the roman senate.
mark antony was welcomed by ephesus for periods when he was proconsul and in 33 bc with cleopatra when he gathered his fleet of 800 ships before the battle of actium with octavius.
when augustus became emperor in 27 bc, the most important change was when he made ephesus the capital of proconsular asia (which covered western asia minor) instead of pergamum. ephesus then entered an era of prosperity, becoming both the seat of the governor and a major centre of commerce. according to strabo, it was second in importance and size only to rome.
the city and temple were destroyed by the goths in 263 ad. this marked the decline of the city's splendour. however emperor constantine the great rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths.
until recently the population of ephesus in roman times was estimated to number up to 225,000 people by broughton. more recent scholarship regards these estimates as unrealistic. such a large estimate would require population densities seen in only a few ancient cities, or extensive settlement outside the city walls. this would have been impossible at ephesus because of the mountain ranges, coastline and quarries which surrounded the city.
the wall of lysimachus has been estimated to enclose an area of . not all of this area was inhabited due to public buildings and spaces in the centre and the steep slope of the bülbül dağı mountain, which was enclosed by the wall. ludwig burchner estimated this area with the walls at 1000.5 acres. jerome murphy-o'connor uses an estimate of 345 hectares5 for the inhabited land or 835 acres (murphey cites ludwig burchner). he cites josiah russell using 832 acres and old jerusalem in 1918 as the yardstick estimated the population at 51,068 at 14.85 persons per thousand square meter. using 51 persons per square meter he arrives at a population between 138,000 and 172,500. j. w. hanson estimated the inhabited space to be smaller at . he argues that population densities of 150 or 250 people per hectare (100 per acre) are more realistic which gives a range of 33,600 to 56,000 inhabitants. even with these much lower population estimates, ephesus was one of the largest cities of roman asia minor, ranking it as the largest city after sardis and alexandria troas. by contrast rome within the walls encompassed 1500 hectares = 3,600 acres with a population estimated to between 750,000 to one million (over 1000 built-up acres were left outside the aurelian wall whose construction was begun in 274 and finished in 279) or 208 to 277 inhabitants per acres including open and public spaces.
ephesus remained the most important city of the byzantine empire in asia after constantinople in the 5th and 6th centuries. emperor flavius arcadius raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. the basilica of st. john was built during the reign of emperor justinian i in the 6th century.
the city was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614 ad.
the importance of the city as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the river (today, küçük menderes) despite repeated dredging during the city's history. (today, the harbour is 5 kilometres inland). the loss of its harbour caused ephesus to lose its access to the aegean sea, which was important for trade. people started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. the ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.
sackings by the arabs first in the year 654–655 by caliph muawiyah i, and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.
when the seljuk turks conquered ephesus in 1090, it was a small village. the byzantines resumed control in 1097 and changed the name of the town to hagios theologos. they kept control of the region until 1308. crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. even the temple of artemis was completely forgotten by the local population. the crusaders of the second crusade fought the seljuks just outside the town in december 1147.
the town surrendered, on 24 october 1304, to sasa bey, a turkish warlord of the menteşoğulları principality. nevertheless, contrary to the terms of the surrender the turks pillaged the church of saint john and deported most of the local population to thyrea, greece when a revolt seemed probable. during these events many of the remaining inhabitants were massacred.
shortly afterwards, ephesus was ceded to the aydinid principality that stationed a powerful navy in the harbour of ayasuluğ (the present-day selçuk, next to ephesus). ayasoluk became an important harbour, from which the navy organised raids to the surrounding regions.
the town knew again a short period of prosperity during the 14th century under these new seljuk rulers. they added important architectural works such as the isa bey mosque, caravansaries and turkish bathhouses (hamam).
ephesians were incorporated as vassals into the ottoman empire for the first time in 1390. the central asian warlord tamerlane defeated the ottomans in anatolia in 1402, and the ottoman sultan bayezid i died in captivity. the region was restored to the anatolian beyliks. after a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the ottoman empire in 1425.
ephesus was completely abandoned by the 15th century. nearby ayasuluğ was renamed selçuk in 1914.
ephesus was an important centre for early christianity from the ad 50s. from ad 52–54, the apostle paul lived in ephesus, working with the congregation and apparently organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands. initially, according to the acts of the apostles, paul attended the jewish synagogue in ephesus, but after three months he became frustrated with the stubbornness or hardness of heart of some of the jews, and moved his base to the school of tyrannus (). the jamieson-fausset-brown bible commentary reminds readers that the unbelief of "some" () implies that "others, probably a large number, believed" and therefore there must have been a community of jewish christians in ephesus. paul introduced about twelve men to the 'baptism with the holy spirit' who had previously only experienced the baptism of john the baptist (), and later became embroiled in a dispute with some artisans whose livelihood depended on selling statuettes of artemis () in the temple of artemis (). between 53 and 57 ad paul wrote the letter 1 corinthians from ephesus (possibly from the 'paul tower' near the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). later, paul wrote the epistle to the ephesians while he was in prison in rome (around 62 ad).
roman asia was associated with john, one of the chief apostles, and the gospel of john might have been written in ephesus, "c" 90–100. ephesus was one of the seven cities addressed in the book of revelation, indicating that the church at ephesus was strong.
two decades later, the church at ephesus was still important enough to be addressed by a letter written by bishop ignatius of antioch to the ephesians in the early 2nd century ad, that begins with, "ignatius, who is also called theophorus, to the church which is at ephesus, in asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of god the father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory" ("letter to the ephesians"). the church at ephesus had given their support for ignatius, who was taken to rome for execution.
a legend, which was first mentioned by epiphanius of salamis in the 4th century ad, purported that mary may have spent the last years of her life in ephesus. the ephesians derived the argument from john's presence in the city, and jesus’ instructions to john to take care of mary after his death. epiphanius, however, was keen to point out that, while the bible says john was leaving for asia, it does not say specifically that mary went with him. he later stated that she was buried in jerusalem. since the 19th century, the house of the virgin mary, about from selçuk, has been considered to have been the last home of mary, mother of jesus in the roman catholic tradition, based on the visions of sister anne catherine emmerich. it is a popular place of catholic pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent popes.
the church of mary near the harbour of ephesus was the setting for the third ecumenical council in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of nestorius. a second council of ephesus was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the catholics. it came to be called the robber council of ephesus or robber synod of latrocinium by its opponents.
ephesus is one of the largest roman archaeological sites in the eastern mediterranean. the visible ruins still give some idea of the city's original splendour, and the names associated with the ruins are evocative of its former life. the theatre dominates the view down harbour street, which leads to the silted-up harbour.
the temple of artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, once stood 418' by 239' with over 100 marble pillars each 56' high. the temple earned the city the title "servant of the goddess". pliny tells us that the magnificent structure took 120 years to build but is now represented only by one inconspicuous column, revealed during an archaeological excavation by the british museum in the 1870s. some fragments of the frieze (which are insufficient to suggest the form of the original) and other small finds were removed – some to london and some to the istanbul archaeology museums.
the library of celsus, the façade of which has been carefully reconstructed from original pieces, was originally built c. 125 ad in memory of tiberius julius celsus polemaeanus, an ancient greek who served as governor of roman asia (105–107) in the roman empire. celsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth and is buried in a sarcophagus beneath it. the library was mostly built by his son gaius julius aquila and once held nearly 12,000 scrolls. designed with an exaggerated entrance — so as to enhance its perceived size, speculate many historians — the building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.
at an estimated 25,000 seating capacity, the theatre is believed to be the largest in the ancient world. this open-air theatre was used initially for drama, but during later roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage; the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard was found in may 2007.
there were two agoras, one for commercial and one for state business.
ephesus also had several major bath complexes, built at various times while the city was under roman rule.
the city had one of the most advanced aqueduct systems in the ancient world, with at least six aqueducts of various sizes supplying different areas of the city. they fed a number of water mills, one of which has been identified as a sawmill for marble.
the odeon was a small roofed theatre constructed by publius vedius antoninus and his wife around 150 ad. it was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. there were 22 stairs in the theatre. the upper part of the theatre was decorated with red granite pillars in the corinthian style. the entrances were at both sides of the stage and reached by a few steps.
the temple of hadrian dates from the 2nd century but underwent repairs in the 4th century and has been reerected from the surviving architectural fragments. the reliefs in the upper sections are casts, the originals now being exhibited in the ephesus archaeological museum. a number of figures are depicted in the reliefs, including the emperor theodosius i with his wife and eldest son. the temple was depicted on the reverse of the turkish 20 million lira banknote of 2001–2005 and of the 20 new lira banknote of 2005–2009.
the temple of the sebastoi (sometimes called the temple of domitian), dedicated to the flavian dynasty, was one of the largest temples in the city. it was erected on a pseudodipteral plan with 8 × 13 columns. the temple and its statue are some of the few remains connected with domitian.
the tomb/fountain of pollio was erected in 97 ad in honour of c. sextilius pollio, who constructed the marnas aqueduct, by offilius proculus. it has a concave façade.
a part of the site, basilica of st. john, was built in the 6th century ad, under emperor justinian i, over the supposed site of the apostle's tomb. it is now surrounded by selçuk.
ephesus is believed to be the city of the seven sleepers. the story of the seven sleepers, who are considered saints by catholics and orthodox christians and whose story is also mentioned in the qur'an, tells that they were persecuted because of their monotheistic belief in god and that they slept in a cave near ephesus for centuries.
the history of archaeological research in ephesus stretches back to 1863, when british architect john turtle wood, sponsored by the british museum, began to search for the artemision. in 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. in 1895 german archaeologist otto benndorf, financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by austrian karl mautner ritter von markhof, resumed excavations. in 1898 benndorf founded the austrian archaeological institute, which plays a leading role in ephesus today.
finds from the site are exhibited notably in the ephesos museum in vienna, the ephesus archaeological museum in selçuk and in the british museum.
in october 2016, turkey halted the works of the archeologists, which had been ongoing for more than 100 years, due to tensions between austria and turkey. in may 2018, turkey allowed austrian archeologists to resume their excavations.

javascript (), often abbreviated as js, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ecmascript specification. javascript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
alongside html and css, javascript is one of the core technologies of the world wide web. javascript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. the vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated javascript engine to execute it.
as a multi-paradigm language, javascript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. it has apis for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the dom, but the language itself does not include any i/o, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. it relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, javascript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and pdf software, and in runtime environments that make javascript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
the terms "vanilla javascript" and "vanilla js" refer to javascript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. scripts written in vanilla js are plain javascript code.
although there are similarities between javascript and java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. javascript was influenced by programming languages such as self and scheme. the json serialization format, used to store data structures in files or transmit them across networks, is based on javascript.
in 1993, the national center for supercomputing applications (ncsa), a unit of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, released ncsa mosaic, the first popular graphical web browser, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent world wide web beyond the nextstep niche where the worldwideweb had formed three years earlier. in 1994, a company called mosaic communications was founded in mountain view, california and employed many of the original ncsa mosaic authors to create mosaic netscape. however, it intentionally shared no code with ncsa mosaic. the internal codename for the company's browser was mozilla, a portmanteau of "mosaic and godzilla". the first version of the web browser, mosaic netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. within four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web browser for the 1990s. to avoid trademark ownership problems with the ncsa, the browser was subsequently renamed netscape navigator in the same year, and the company took the name netscape communications. netscape communications realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. marc andreessen, the founder of the company, believed that html needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the web page markup.
in 1995, netscape communications recruited brendan eich with the goal of embedding the scheme programming language into its netscape navigator. before he could get started, netscape communications collaborated with sun microsystems to include sun's more static programming language, java, in netscape navigator so as to compete with microsoft for user adoption of web technologies and platforms. netscape communications then decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement java and should have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as perl, python, tcl, or scheme. to defend the idea of javascript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. eich wrote one in 10 days, in may 1995.
although it was developed under the name mocha, the language was officially called livescript when it first shipped in beta releases of netscape navigator 2.0 in september 1995, but it was renamed javascript when it was deployed in the netscape navigator 2.0 beta 3 in december. the final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by netscape to give javascript the cachet of what was then the hot new web programming language.
there is a common misconception that javascript was influenced by an earlier web page scripting language developed by nombas named cmm (not to be confused with the later c-- created in 1997). brendan eich, however, had never heard of cmm before he created livescript. nombas did pitch their embedded web page scripting to netscape, though web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by the violawww web browser. nombas later switched to offering javascript instead of cmm in their scriptease product and was part of the tc39 group that standardized ecmascript.
in december 1995, soon after releasing javascript for browsers, netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with netscape enterprise server.
since 1996, the iis web-server has supported microsoft's implementation of server-side javascript—jscript—in asp and .net pages.
since the mid-2000s, additional server-side javascript implementations have been introduced, such as node.js in 2009.
microsoft script technologies including vbscript and jscript were released in 1996. jscript, a reverse-engineered implementation of netscape's javascript, was part of internet explorer 3. jscript was also available for server-side scripting in internet information server. internet explorer 3 also included microsoft's first support for css and various extensions to html, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different from that found in netscape navigator at the time. these differences made it difficult for designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers, leading to the use of "best viewed in netscape" and "best viewed in internet explorer" logos that characterized these early years of the browser wars. javascript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a cross-platform and standards-driven web. some developers took on the difficult task of trying to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time. with the release of internet explorer 4, microsoft introduced the concept of dynamic html, but the differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary document object models remained and were obstacles to widespread take-up of javascript on the web.
in november 1996, netscape submitted javascript to ecma international to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at netscape. this led to the official release of the language specification ecmascript published in the first edition of the ecma-262 standard in june 1997, with javascript being the most well known of the implementations. actionscript and jscript were other well-known implementations of ecmascript.
the release of ecmascript 2 in june 1998 continued the standards process cycle, conforming some modifications to the iso/iec 16262 international standard. ecmascript 3 was released in december 1999 and is the modern-day baseline for javascript. the original ecmascript 4 work led by waldemar horwat (then at netscape, now at google) started in 2000. microsoft initially participated and implemented some proposals in their jscript .net language.
over time it was clear that microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper javascript in internet explorer, even though they had no competing proposal and they had a partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the .net server side. so by 2003, the original ecmascript 4 work was mothballed.
the next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in javascript's history. first, brendan eich and mozilla rejoined ecma international as a not-for-profit member and work started on ecmascript for xml (e4x), the ecma-357 standard, which came from ex-microsoft employees at bea systems (originally acquired as crossgain). this led to working jointly with macromedia (later acquired by adobe systems), who were implementing e4x in actionscript 3 (actionscript 3 was a fork of original ecmascript 4).
so, along with macromedia, work restarted on ecmascript 4 with the goal of standardizing what was in actionscript 3. to this end, adobe systems released the actionscript virtual machine 2, code named tamarin, as an open source project. but tamarin and actionscript 3 were too different from web javascript to converge, as was realized by the parties in 2007 and 2008.
alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; douglas crockford—then at yahoo!—joined forces with microsoft in 2007 to oppose ecmascript 4, which led to the ecmascript 3.1 effort. the development of ecmascript 4 was never completed, but that work influenced subsequent versions.
while all of this was happening, the open source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with javascript. this community effort was sparked in 2005 when jesse james garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which javascript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and leading to more dynamic applications. this resulted in a renaissance period of javascript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as prototype, jquery, dojo toolkit, mootools, and others being released.
in july 2008, the disparate parties on either side came together in oslo. this led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to rename ecmascript 3.1 to ecmascript 5 and drive the language forward using an agenda that is known as harmony. ecmascript 5 was finally released in december 2009.
in june 2011, ecmascript 5.1 was released to fully align with the third edition of the iso/iec 16262 international standard. ecmascript 2015 was released in june 2015. ecmascript 2016 was released in june 2016. the current version is ecmascript 2017, released in june 2017.
javascript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the web. however, many professional programmers initially denigrated the language due to the perceived target audience of web authors and other such "amateurs". the advent of ajax returned javascript to the spotlight and brought more professional programming attention. the result was a proliferation of comprehensive frameworks and libraries, improved javascript programming practices, and increased usage of javascript outside web browsers, as seen by the proliferation of server-side javascript platforms.
in january 2009, the commonjs project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard library mainly for javascript development outside the browser.
with the rise of single-page applications and javascript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages.
"javascript" is a trademark of oracle corporation in the united states. it is used under license for technology invented and implemented by netscape communications and current entities such as the mozilla foundation.
the following features are common to all conforming ecmascript implementations, unless explicitly specified otherwise.
all popular modern web browsers support javascript with built-in interpreters.
javascript supports much of the structured programming syntax from c (e.g., codice_1 statements, codice_2 loops, codice_3 statements, codice_4 loops, etc.). one partial exception is scoping: javascript originally had only function scoping with codice_5. ecmascript 2015 added keywords codice_6 and codice_7 for block scoping, meaning javascript now has both function and block scoping. like c, javascript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. one syntactic difference from c is automatic semicolon insertion, which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.
javascript is almost entirely object-based. in javascript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each string key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (codice_9) and bracket notation (codice_10). a property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a codice_11 loop.
javascript has a small number of built-in objects, including codice_12 and codice_13.
a function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object. as such, a function may have properties and methods, such as codice_23 and codice_24. a "nested" function is a function defined within another function. it is created each time the outer function is invoked. in addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes. javascript also supports anonymous functions.
javascript supports implicit and explicit delegation.
javascript is officially managed by mozilla foundation, and new language features are added periodically. however, only some javascript engines support these new features:
variables in javascript can be defined using either the codice_5, codice_6 or codice_7 keywords.
var x; // declares the variable x and assigns to it the special value "undefined" (not to be confused with an undefined value)
var y = 2; // declares the variable y and assigns to it the value 2
var z = "hello, world!"; // declares the variable z and assigns to it a string containing "hello, world!"
note the comments in the example above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.
there is no built-in input/output functionality in javascript; the run-time environment provides that. the ecmascript specification in edition 5.1 mentions:
indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results.
however, most runtime environments have a codice_38 object that can be used to print output. here is a minimalist hello world program in javascript:
console.log("hello world!");
a simple recursive function:
function factorial(n) {
factorial(3); // returns 6
an anonymous function (or lambda):
function counter() {
var closure = counter();
closure(); // returns 1
closure(); // returns 2
closure(); // returns 3
this example shows that, in javascript, function closures capture their non-local variables by reference.
arrow functions were first introduced in 6th edition - ecmascript 2015 . they shorten the syntax for writing functions in javascript. arrow functions are anonymous in nature, a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation.
example of arrow function:
// arrow functions let us omit the `function` keyword. here `long_example`
// points to an anonymous function value.
const long_example = (input1, input2) => {
// arrow functions also let us automatically return the expression to the right
// of the arrow (here `input + 5`), omitting braces and the `return` keyword.
const short_example = input => input + 5;
long_example(2, 3); // prints "hello, world!" and returns 5.
short_example(2); // returns 7.
in javascript, objects are created in the same way as functions; this is known as a function object.
object example:
function ball(r) {
var myball = new ball(5); // creates a new instance of the ball object with radius 5
myball.show(); // this instance of the ball object has the show function performed on it
variadic function demonstration (codice_30 is a special variable):
function sum() {
sum(1, 2); // returns 3
sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
immediately-invoked function expressions are often used to create modules; before ecmascript 2015 there was no built-in module construct in the language. modules allow gathering properties and methods in a namespace and making some of them private:
var counter = (function () {
})(); // module
counter.get(); // shows 0
counter.set(6);
counter.increment(); // shows 7
counter.increment(); // shows 8
exporting and importing modules in javascript
export example:
/* mymodule.js */
// this function remains private, as it is not exported
let sum = (a, b) => {
// export variables
export var name = 'alice';
export let age = 23;
// export named functions
export function add(num1, num2){
// export class
export class multiplication {
import example:
// import one property
import { add } from './mymodule.js';
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
// import multiple properties
import { name, age } from './mymodule.js';
console.log(name, age);
//> "alice", 23
// import all properties from a module
import * from './module.js'
console.log(name, age);
//> "alice", 23
console.log(add(1,2));
//> 3
this sample code displays various javascript features.
/* finds the lowest common multiple (lcm) of two numbers */
function lcmcalculator(x, y) { // constructor function
// the prototype of object instances created by a constructor is
// that constructor's "prototype" property.
lcmcalculator.prototype = { // object literal
};
// define generic output function; this implementation only works for web browsers
function output(x) {
// note: array's map() and foreach() are defined in javascript 1.6.
// they are used here to demonstrate javascript's inherent functional nature.
].map(function(pair) { // array literal + mapping function
function printresult(obj) {
the following output should be displayed in the browser window.
lcmcalculator: a = 28, b = 56, gcd = 28, lcm = 56
lcmcalculator: a = 21, b = 56, gcd = 7, lcm = 168
lcmcalculator: a = 25, b = 55, gcd = 5, lcm = 275
lcmcalculator: a = 22, b = 58, gcd = 2, lcm = 638
94.5% of 10 million most popular web pages used javascript. the most common use of javascript is to add client-side behavior to html pages, also known as dynamic html (dhtml). scripts are embedded in or included from html pages and interact with the document object model (dom) of the page. some simple examples of this usage are:
javascript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server), increasing the application's overall responsiveness to user actions. javascript code can also detect user actions that html alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. applications such as gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface logic is written in javascript, and javascript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. the wider trend of ajax programming similarly exploits this strength.
a javascript engine (also known as javascript interpreter or javascript implementation) is an interpreter that interprets javascript source code and executes the script accordingly. the first javascript engine was created by brendan eich at netscape, for the netscape navigator web browser. the engine, code-named spidermonkey, is implemented in c. it has since been updated (in javascript 1.5) to conform to ecmascript 3. the rhino engine, created primarily by norris boyd (formerly at netscape, now at google) is a javascript implementation in java. rhino, like spidermonkey, is ecmascript 3 compliant.
a web browser is the most common host environment for javascript. however, a web browsers does not have to execute javascript code. (for example, text-based browsers have no javascript engines; and users of other browsers may disable scripts through a preference or extension.)
a web browser typically creates "host objects" to represent the dom in javascript. the web server is another common host environment. a javascript web server would typically expose host objects representing http request and response objects, which a javascript program could then interrogate and manipulate to dynamically generate web pages.
javascript is the only language that the most popular browsers share support for and has inadvertently become a target language for frameworks in other languages. the increasing speed of javascript engines has made the language a feasible compilation target, despite the performance limitations inherent to its dynamic nature.
below is a minimal example of a standards-conforming web page containing javascript (using html 5 syntax) and the dom:
<!doctype html>
<html>
</html>
because javascript runs in widely varying environments, an important part of testing and debugging is to test and verify that the javascript works across multiple browsers.
the dom interfaces are officially defined by the w3c in a standardization effort separate from javascript. the implementation of these dom interfaces differ between web browsers.
javascript authors can deal with these differences by writing standards-compliant code that can be executed correctly by most browsers. failing that, they can write code that behaves differently in the absence of certain browser features. authors may also find it practical to detect what browser is running, as two browsers may implement the same feature with differing behavior. libraries and toolkits that take browser differences into account are also useful to programmers.
furthermore, scripts may not work for some users. for example, a user may:
to support these users, web authors can try to create pages that degrade gracefully on user agents (browsers) that do not support the page's javascript. in particular, the page should remain usable albeit without the extra features that the javascript would have added. some sites use the html codice_40 tag, which contains alt content if js is disabled. an alternative approach that many find preferable is to first author content using basic technologies that work in all browsers, then enhance the content for users that have javascript enabled.
javascript and the dom provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the web. browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. first, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. most javascript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.
there are subsets of general javascript—adsafe, secure ecmascript (ses)—that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). caja is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party javascript and html.
content security policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a web page.
a common javascript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (xss), a violation of the same-origin policy. xss vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to cause a target web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. the script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. a solution to xss vulnerabilities is to use "html escaping" whenever displaying untrusted data.
some browsers include partial protection against "reflected" xss attacks, in which the attacker provides a url including malicious script. however, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other xss attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. only correct design of web applications on the server side can fully prevent xss.
xss vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.
another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (csrf). in csrf, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). when target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. in general, the solution to csrf is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. checking the http referrer header can also help.
"javascript hijacking" is a type of csrf attack in which a codice_29 tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as json or javascript. possible solutions include:
developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. the application author cannot assume that their javascript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. some implications are:
package management systems such as npm and bower are popular with javascript developers. such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. a vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. in a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at-least one known vulnerability. "the median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in alexa, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago." another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. this occurred in march 2016 when azer koçulu removed his repository from npm. this caused all tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.
javascript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. these flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. this code is not by any means limited to another javascript application. for example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's api with superuser privileges.
these flaws have affected major browsers including firefox, internet explorer, and safari.
plugins, such as video players, adobe flash, and the wide range of activex controls enabled by default in microsoft internet explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via javascript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).
in windows vista, microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the internet explorer process with limited privileges. google chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own "sandbox".
web browsers are capable of running javascript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the web.
incorrectly granting privileges to javascript from the web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both internet explorer and firefox. in windows xp service pack 2, microsoft demoted jscript's privileges in internet explorer.
microsoft windows allows javascript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: windows script host). this makes javascript (like vbscript) a theoretically viable vector for a trojan horse, although javascript trojan horses are uncommon in practice.
in 2015, a javascript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.
in 2017, a javascript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass aslr. it's called "aslr⊕cache" or anc.
in addition to web browsers and servers, javascript interpreters are embedded in a number of tools. each of these applications provides its own object model that provides access to the host environment. the core javascript language remains mostly the same in each application.
within javascript, access to a debugger becomes invaluable when developing large, non-trivial programs. there can be implementation differences between the various browsers (particularly within the dom), so it is useful to have access to a debugger for each of the browsers that a web application targets.
script debuggers are integrated within many mainstream browsers such as internet explorer, firefox, safari, google chrome, opera and node.js.
in addition to the native internet explorer developer tools, three other debuggers are available for internet explorer: microsoft visual studio has the most features of the three, closely followed by microsoft script editor (a component of microsoft office), and finally the free microsoft script debugger. the free microsoft visual web developer express provides a limited version of the javascript debugging functionality in microsoft visual studio.
in comparison to internet explorer, firefox has a more comprehensive set of developer tools, which includes a debugger as well. old versions of firefox without these tools used a firefox addon called firebug, or the older venkman debugger. webkit's web inspector includes a javascript debugger, which is used in safari. a modified version called blink devtools is used in google chrome. node.js has node inspector, an interactive debugger that integrates with the blink devtools. opera includes a set of tools called dragonfly.
in addition to the native computer software, there are online javascript integrated development environment (ides), which has debugging aids that are themselves written in javascript and built to run on the web. an example is the program jslint, developed by douglas crockford who has written extensively on the language. jslint scans javascript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. many libraries for javascript, such as three.js, provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. demonstration codes are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as khan academy to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a web browser.
javascript's increased usage in web development warrants further considerations about performance. frontend code has inherited many responsibilities previously handled by the backend. mobile devices in particular may encounter problems rendering poorly optimized frontend code.
a library for doing benchmarks is benchmark.js. a benchmarking library that supports high-resolution timers and returns statistically significant results.
another tool is jsben.ch. an online javascript benchmarking tool, where code snippets can be tested against each other.
javascript was initially developed in 1996 for use in the netscape navigator web browser. in the same year microsoft released an implementation for internet explorer. this implementation was called jscript due to trademark issues. in 1997, the first standardized version of the language was released under the name ecmascript in the first edition of the ecma-262 standard.
the explicit versioning and opt-in of language features was mozilla-specific and has been removed in later firefox versions (at least by firefox 59). firefox 4 was the last version which referred to an explicit javascript version (1.8.5). with new editions of the ecma-262 standard, javascript language features are now often mentioned with their initial definition in the ecma-262 editions.
the following table of explicitly versioned javascript versions is based on information from multiple sources.
as javascript is the most widely supported client-side language that can run within a web browser, it has become an intermediate language for other languages (also called "transpilers") to target. this has included both newly created languages and ports of existing languages. some of these include:
as javascript has unusual limitations – such as no explicit integer type, only double-precision binary floating point – languages that compile to javascript and do not take care to use the integer-converting shift and bitwise logical operators may have slightly different behavior than in other environments.
a common misconception is that javascript is similar or closely related to java. it is true that both have a c-like syntax (the c language being their most immediate common ancestor language). they also are both typically sandboxed (when used inside a browser), and javascript was designed with java's syntax and standard library in mind. in particular, all java keywords were reserved in original javascript, javascript's standard library follows java's naming conventions, and javascript's and objects are based on classes from java 1.0, but the similarities end there.
java and javascript both first appeared in 1995, but java was developed by james gosling of sun microsystems, and javascript by brendan eich of netscape communications.
the differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. java has static typing, while javascript's typing is dynamic. java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while javascript is loaded as human-readable source code. java's objects are class-based, while javascript's are prototype-based. finally, java did not support functional programming until java 8, while javascript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by scheme.
starting in 2017, web browsers began supporting webassembly, a technology standardized by the w3c. the webassembly standard specifies a binary format, which can be produced by a compiler toolchain such as llvm, to execute in the browser at near native speed. webassembly allows programming languages such as c, c++, c# and java to be used as well as javascript to author client-side code for the world wide web.

elbing is the german name of elbląg, a city in northern poland which until 1945 was a german city in the province of east prussia.
elbing may also refer to:

to be in exile means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.
in roman law, "exsilium" denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.
the terms diaspora and refugee describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and "government in exile" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.
article 9 of the universal declaration of human rights states that "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."
in some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.
a wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a "tax exile". creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. examples include the british-canadian writer arthur hailey, who moved to the bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels "hotel" and "airport", and the english rock band the rolling stones who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left britain before the government could seize their assets. members of the band all moved to france for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called "exile on main street", the main street of the title referring to the french riviera. in 2012, eduardo saverin, one of the founders of facebook, made headlines by renouncing his u.s. citizenship before his company's ipo. the dual brazilian/u.s. citizen's decision to move to singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the u.s. senate, the ex-patriot act, which would have forced such wealthy "tax exiles" to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the united states.
in some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. an example of this is asil nadir, who fled to the turkish republic of northern cyprus for 17 years rather than face prosecution in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company polly peck in the united kingdom.
examples include:
it is an alternative theory recently developed by a young anthropologist, balan in 2018. according to him, comfortable exile is a "social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society. such people are considered 'aliens' or internal 'others' on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture."
when a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the jews, who were deported by babylonian king nebuchadnezzar ii in 586 bc and again following the destruction of the second temple in jerusalem in ad 70. many jewish prayers include a yearning to return to jerusalem and the jewish homeland.
after the partitions of poland in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like kościuszko uprising, november uprising and january uprising) against the partitioning powers (russian empire, prussia and austro-hungary), many poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as polonia), especially in france and the united states. the entire population of crimean tatars (200,000) that remained in their homeland crimea was exiled on 18 may 1944 to central asia as a form of ethnic cleansing and collective punishment on false accusations. at diego garcia, between 1967 and 1973 the british government forcibly removed some 2,000 chagossian resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the us and uk.
since the cuban revolution over one million cubans have left cuba. most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. it is to be noted that at the time of the cuban revolution, cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be cuban exiles. it is to be noted that under cuban law, children of cubans born abroad are considered cuban citizens.
during a foreign occupation or after a coup d'état, a "government in exile" of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. one of the most well-known instances of this is the polish government-in-exile, a government in exile that commanded polish armed forces operating outside poland after german occupation during world war ii. other examples include the free french forces government of charles de gaulle of the same time, and the central tibetan administration, commonly known as the tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th dalai lama.
exile is an early motif in ancient greek tragedy. in the ancient greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. the motif reaches its peak on the play "medea", written by euripides in the fifth century bc, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of greek mythology. euripides’ medea has remained the most frequently performed greek tragedy through the 20th century.
after medea was abandoned by jason and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to athens and married king aigeus there, and became the stepmother of the hero theseus. due to a conflict with him, she must leave the polis and go away into exile. john william waterhouse (1849–1917), the english pre-raphaelite painter’s famous picture "jason and medea" shows a key moment before, when medea tries to poison theseus.
in ancient rome, the roman senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. one of the roman victims was the poet ovid, who lived during the reign of augustus. he was forced to leave rome and move away to the city of tomis on the black sea, now constanta. there he wrote his famous work "tristia" (sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.
another, at least in a temporary exile, was dante.
the german-language writer franz kafka describes the exile of karl rossmann in the posthumously published novel "amerika".
during the period of national socialism in the first few years after 1933, many jews, as well as a significant number of german artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors klaus mann and anna seghers. so germany's own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit. klaus mann finished his novel "" ("the volcano. a novel among emigrants") in 1939 describing the german exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form", as he wrote in his literary balance sheet. at the same place and in the same year, anna seghers published her famous novel "das siebte kreuz" ("the seventh cross", published in the united states in 1942).
important exile literatures in recent years include that of the caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to europe or the united states for political or economic reasons. these writers include nobel prize winners v. s. naipaul and derek walcott as well as the novelists edwidge danticat and sam selvon.

elbląg (; ; old prussian: "elbings") is a city in northern poland on the eastern edge of the żuławy region with 120,142 inhabitants (december 2018). it is the capital of elbląg county and has been assigned (since 1999) to the warmian-masurian voivodeship. previously it was the capital of elbląg voivodeship (1975–1998) and a county seat within gdańsk voivodeship (1945–1975).
elbląg is one of the oldest cities in the province. its history dates back to 1237, when the teutonic order constructed their fortified stronghold on the banks of a nearby river. the castle subsequently served as the official seat of the teutonic order masters.
elbląg became part of the hanseatic league, which contributed much to the city's wealth. through the hansa agreement, the city was linked to other major ports like gdańsk, lübeck and amsterdam. elbląg joined poland in 1454 and after the defeat of the teutonic knights in the thirteen years’ war was recognized as part of poland in the second peace of thorn in 1466. it then flourished and turned into a significant trading point, but its growth was eventually hindered by the second northern war and the swedish deluge.
the city was transferred to prussia after the first partition of poland in 1772. its trading role greatly weakened, until the era of industrialization, which occurred in the 19th century. it was then that the famous elbląg canal was commissioned.
after world war ii the city again became part of poland. the war casualties were catastrophic, especially the severe destruction of the old town district, one of the grandest and most beautiful in east prussia.
today, elbląg has over 120,000 inhabitants and is a "vibrant city with an attractive tourist base". it serves as an academic and financial center and among its numerous historic monuments is the market gate from 1309 and st. nicholas cathedral. elbląg is also known for its archaeological sites, museums and the largest brewery in the country.
the elbląg canal, built in 1825–44 under prussia, is a tourist site of elbląg. the canal is believed to be one of the most important monuments related to the history of engineering and has been named one of the seven wonders of poland. the canal was also named one of poland's official national historic monuments ("pomnik historii") in 2011. its listing is maintained by the national heritage board of poland.
"elbląg" derives from the earlier german-language "elbing", which is the name by which the teutonic knights knew both the river here and the citadel they established on its banks in 1237. the purpose of the citadel was to prevent the old prussian settlement of truso from being reoccupied, the german crusaders being at war with the pagan prussians. the citadel was named after the river, itself of uncertain etymology. one traditional etymology connects it to the name of the helveconae, a germanic tribe mentioned in ancient greek and latin sources, but the etymology or language of the tribal name remains unknown. the oldest known mention of the river or town elbing is in the form "ylfing" in the report of a sailor wulfstan from the end of the 9th century, in "" which was written in anglo-saxon in king alfred's reign.
elbing was almost completely destroyed at the end of world war ii. the city became the polish elbląg after the war, when the area was ceded to poland under border changes promulgated at the potsdam conference. parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt, and around 2000 rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture, in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls. the western suburbs of the old city have not been reconstructed.
the modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between lake drużno and elbląg bay ("zatoka elbląska", an arm of the vistula lagoon), and spreads out on both banks, though mainly on the eastern side. to the east is the elbląg upland ("wysoczyzna elbląska"), a dome pushed up by glacial compression, 390 km in diameter and high at its greatest elevation. it gives the appearance of ridges and parkland.
views to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon; this part of the vistula delta ("żuławy wiślane") is used mainly for agricultural purposes. to the south are the marshes and swamps of drużno. the elbląg river has been left in a more natural state through the city, but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches. one of them, the jagiellonski channel ("kanał jagielloński"), leads to the nogat river, along which navigation to gdańsk is common. the elbląg canal ("kanał elbląski") connecting lake drużno with drwęca river and lake jeziorak is a popular tourist site.
elbląg is not a deep-water port. the draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than by law. the turning area at elbląg is diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels. deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, elbląg has become a subsidiary port of gdańsk. traffic of smaller vessels at elbląg is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels cannot reach the open baltic sea because the channel, once built in east-prussia to go through the peninsula, has belonged to russia since 1945. the city features three quay complexes, movable cranes, and railways.
elbląg is located about south-east of gdańsk and south-west of kaliningrad, russia.
the city is a port on the river elbląg, which flows into the vistula lagoon about to the north, thus giving the city access to the baltic sea via the russian-controlled strait of baltiysk. the old town () is located on the river elbląg connecting lake drużno to the vistula lagoon, about from the lagoon and from gdańsk.
the settlement was first mentioned as "ilfing" in "", an anglo-saxon chronicle written in king alfred's reign using information from a viking who had visited the area.
during the middle ages, the viking settlement of truso was located on lake drużno, near the current site of elbląg in historical pogesania; the settlement burned down in the 10th century. early in the 13th century the teutonic knights conquered the region, built a castle, and founded elbing on the lake, with a population mostly from lübeck (today the lake, now much smaller, no longer reaches the city). after the uprising against the teutonic knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants, the city successively came under the sovereignty of the polish crown (1454), the kingdom of prussia (1772), and germany (1871). elbing was heavily damaged in world war ii, and its german citizens were expelled upon the war's end. the city became part of poland in 1945 and was repopulated with polish citizens.
the seaport of truso was first mentioned ca. 890 by wulfstan of hedeby, an anglo-saxon sailor, travelling on the south coast of the baltic sea at the behest of king alfred the great of england. the exact location of truso was not known for a long time, as the seashore has significantly changed, but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern elbląg on lake drużno. truso was located at territory already known to the roman empire and earlier.
it was an important seaport serving the vistula river bay on the early medieval baltic sea trade routes which led from birka in the north to the island of gotland and to visby in the baltic sea. from there, traders continued further south to carnuntum along the amber road. the ancient amber road led further southwest and southeast to the black sea and eventually to asia. the east-west trade route went from truso, along the baltic sea to jutland, and from there inland by river to hedeby, a large trading center in jutland. the main goods of truso were amber, furs, and slaves.
archaeological finds in 1897 and diggings in the 1920s placed truso at gut hansdorf. a large burial field was also found at elbing. recent polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about 20 hectares. many of these artifacts are now displayed at the muzeum w elblągu.
attempts to conquer prussian land began in 997, when bolesław i the brave, at the urging of the pope, sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary (adalbert of prague) to the pagan prussians, a non-slavic people, on a crusade of conquest and conversion. the crusade encompassed much of the baltic sea coast, including danzig (present day gdańsk), and other areas of the coast up to sambia. starting in 1209 additional crusades were called for by konrad of masovia, who mainly sought to conquer prussian territory, rather than actually convert the indigenous prussians. despite heroic efforts, old prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by pope honorius iii and his frequent calls for crusade.
before the prussians and their neighbors to the west, the pomeranians, were finally brought to heel, polish rulers and the duchy of masovia, both by then christianised peoples, would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion. aside from minor border raids, major campaigns against the prussians would be launched in 1219, 1220, and 1222. after a particularly sound defeat by prussian forces in 1223, polish forces in chełmno, the seat of christian of oliva and the duchy of masovia, were forced onto the defensive.
in 1226 duke konrad i of masovia summoned the teutonic knights for assistance; by 1230 they had secured chełmno (culm) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the holy roman empire, although these claims were rejected by the poles, whose ambition had been to conquer prussia all along. the teutonic order's strategy was to move down the vistula and secure the delta, establishing a barrier between the prussians and danzig. the victorious teutonic knights built a castle at elbing.
the chronicon terrae prussiae describes the conflict in the vicinity of lake drusen (now drużno) shortly before the founding of elbing:
truso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of elbing during the prussian crusade. it had already burned down in the tenth century, with the population dispersed in the area.
the chronicon terrae prussiae describes the founding of elbing under the leadership of hermann balk. after building two ships, the pilgerim (pilgrim) and the vridelant (friedland), with the assistance of margrave henry iii of margraviate of meissen, the teutonic knights used them to clear the vistula lagoon ("frisches haff") and the vistula spit of prussians:
apparently the river was in pomesania, which the knights had just finished clearing, but the bay was in pogesania. the first elbing was placed in pogesania:
both landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships. the "chronicon" relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in lake drusen. in 1238 the dominican order was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land. pomesania was not secured, however, and from 1240-1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement. it may be significant that elbing's first industry was the same as truso's had been: manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export. in 1243 william of modena created the diocese of pomesania and three others. they were at first only ideological constructs, but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century.
the foundation of elbing was perhaps not the end of the old prussian story in the region. in 1825 a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the baltic old prussian language, named the elbing-prussian dictionary (), or more commonly in english just elbing vocabulary, was found among some manuscripts from a merchant's house. it contained 802 words in a dialect now termed pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of german.
the origin of the vocabulary remains unknown. its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries; i.e., it may have been used by german speakers to communicate with old prussians, but the specific circumstances are only speculative. the manuscript became the codex neumannianus. it disappeared after a british bombing raid destroyed the library at elbing but before then facsimiles had been made. the date of the mss was estimated at ca. 1400, but it was a copy. there is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original, except that it must have been in pomesanian.
in 1246 the town was granted a constitution under lübeck law, used in maritime circumstances, instead of magdeburg rights common in other cities in central europe. this decision of the order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the trade association that in 1358 would become the hanseatic league. the order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the baltic. the order's involvement in the league was somewhat contradictory. in whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town, who kept office in the citadel, typically used as a prison. lübeck law, on the other hand, provided for self-government of the town.
membership in the hanseatic league meant having important trading contacts with england, flanders, france, and the netherlands. the city received numerous merchant privileges from the rulers of england, poland, pomerania, and the teutonic order. for instance, the privilege of the old town was upgraded in 1343, while in 1393 it was granted an emporium privilege for grains, metals, and forest products.
except for the citadel and churches, elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards. its area was . it featured a wharf, a marketplace and five streets, as well as a number of churches. the castle was completed in 1251. in 1288 fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches, which were of brick. a new circuit wall was started immediately. from 1315 to 1340 elbląg was rebuilt. a separate settlement called new town was founded ca. 1337 and received lübeck rights in 1347. in 1349 the black death struck the town, toward the end of the european plague. after the population recovered it continued building up the city and in 1364 a crane was built for the port.
the german-language "elbinger rechtsbuch", written in elbing, prussia documented among other laws for the first time polish common law. the german-language polish laws are based on the sachsenspiegel and were written down to aid the judges. it is thus the oldest source for documented polish common law and is in polish referred to as the "księga elbląska" (book of elbląg). it was written down in the second half of the 13th century.
in 1440 several western and eastern prussian towns formed the prussian confederation, which led the revolt of prussia against the rule of the teutonic knights in 1454. for assistance against the order, the confederation asked for help from king casimir iv of poland. the burghers of elbląg recognized casimir as rightful ruler. after paying homage to the king, the city was granted great privileges, similar to those of toruń and gdańsk. casimir's incorporation of prussia led to the thirteen years' war.
after the polish victory over the teutonic order, the city became part of the malbork voivodeship in the newly established autonomous province of royal prussia under the suzerainty of the polish crown in the second peace of thorn. the city was known to the polish crown by its polish name elbląg. with the creation of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1569, the city was brought under direct control of the polish crown. as one of the largest and most influential cities of poland, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period in poland.
with the 16th century protestant reformation the burghers became lutherans and the first lutheran gymnasium was established in elbląg in 1535.
from 1579 elbląg had close trade relations with england, to which the city accorded free trade. english, scottish, and irish merchants settled in the city. they formed the scottish reformed church of elbląg and became elbląg citizens, aiding lutheran sweden in the thirty years' war. the rivalry of nearby danzig interrupted trading links several times. by 1618 elbląg had left the hanseatic league owing to its close business dealings with england.
famous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons hans von bodeck and samuel hartlib. during the thirty years' war, swedish chancellor axel oxenstierna brought the moravian brethren refugee john amos comenius to elbląg for six years (1642–1648). in 1642 johann stobäus, who composed with johann eccard, published the " preussische fest-lieder", a number of evangelical prussian songs. in 1646 the city recorder daniel barholz noted that the city council employed "bernsteindreher", or "paternostermacher", licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on prayer beads, rosaries, and many other items made of amber. members of the barholz family became mayors and councillors.
during the thirty years' war, the vistula lagoon was the main southern baltic base of king gustavus adolphus of sweden, who was hailed as the protector of the protestants. by 1660 the vistula lagoon had gone to elector frederick william of brandenburg-prussia, but was returned in 1700.
the poet christian wernicke was born in 1661 in elbląg, while gottfried achenwall became famous for his teachings in natural law and human rights law. in 1700–1710 it was occupied by swedish troops. in 1709 it was besieged, taken by storm on february 2, 1710 by russian troops with support of prussian artillery. the city was handed over to polish king augustus ii in 1712.
the imperial cartographer johann friedrich endersch completed a map of warmia in 1755 and also made a copper etching of the galley named "the city of elbing" .
during the war of the polish succession in 1734, elbląg wasplaced under military occupation by russia and saxony. the town came again under occupation by russia from 1758-1762 during the seven years' war.
during the first partition of poland in 1772 elbląg was annexed by king frederick the great of the kingdom of prussia. elbing became part of the new prussian province of west prussia in 1773. in the 1815 provincial reorganization following the napoleonic wars, elbing and its hinterland were included within regierungsbezirk danzig in west prussia.
elbing industrialized under the sovereignty of the hohenzollern kings in berlin. in 1828 the first steamship was built by ignatz grunau. in 1837 ferdinand schichau started the schichau-werke company in elbing as well as another shipyard in danzig later on. schichau constructed the "borussia", the first screw-vessel in germany. schichau-werke built hydraulic machinery, ships, steam engines, and torpedoes. after the inauguration of the railway to königsberg in 1853, elbing's industry began to grow. schichau worked together with his son-in-law carl h. zise, who continued the industrial complex after schichau's death. schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers.
georg steenke, an engineer from königsberg, connected elbing near the baltic sea with the southern part of prussia by building the oberländischer kanal (elbląg canal).
elbing became part of the prussian-led german empire in 1871 during the unification of germany. as elbing became an industrial city, the social democratic party of germany (spd) frequently received the majority of votes; in the 1912 reichstag elections the spd received 51% of the vote. after world war i, most of west prussia became part of the second polish republic. elbing was joined to german east prussia, and was separated from weimar germany by the so-called polish corridor.
during the nazi germany era (1933–1945), three subcamps of the stutthof concentration camp were located near the town: "elbing", "elbing (org. todt)", and "elbing (schinau)". these were closed and many of the german inhabitants of elbing forced to flee as the soviet red army approached the city toward the end of world war ii (see evacuation of east prussia). laid under siege since january 23, 1945,about 65% of the city infrastructure was destroyed, including most of the historical city center. the town was captured by the soviet red army during the night of february 9/10, 1945. during the first days of the siege most of the population of approximately 100,000 persons fled. after the end of war, in spring 1945, the region together with the town of elbing became part of poland as a result of the potsdam conference and the area was settled by poles after remaining germans were either transferred or fled to germany.
the city was repopulated and given the polish name "elbląg". elbląg' was part of the recovered territories and out the inhabitants, 98% were poles expelled from polish areas annexed by the soviet union from central poland. parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished, with the bricks being used to rebuild warsaw and gdańsk. the communist authorities had originally planned that the old town, utterly destroyed during the fighting since january 23, 1945, would be built over with blocks of flats; however, economic difficulties thwarted this effort. two churches were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s.
along with tricity and szczecin, elbląg was the scene of rioting in the coastal cities in 1970 (see also polish 1970 protests). since 1990 the german minority population has had a modest resurgence, with the elbinger deutsche minderheit organization counting around 450 members in 2000.
restoration of the old town began after 1989. since the beginning of the restoration, an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out. most of the city's heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the 19th century or during world war ii, but the backyards and latrines of the houses remained largely unchanged, and have provided information on the city's history. in some instances, private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture. by 2006, approximately 75% of the old town had been reconstructed. the city museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use, including the only 15th century binoculars preserved in europe.
elbląg is also home to the elbrewery, poland's largest brewery, which belongs to the żywiec group (heineken). the history of the elblag brewing tradition dates back to 1309, when teutonic master siegfried von leuchtwangen granted brewing privileges to the town of elbing. the present brewery was founded in 1872 as the elbinger aktien-brauerei. in the early 1900s, the brewery was the exclusive supplier of pilsner beer to the court of german emperor wilhelm ii.
until world war ii there were many gothic, renaissance and baroque houses in elbląg's old town; some of them are reconstructed. other preserved buildings are:

europe of democracies and diversities (edd) was a eurosceptic political group with seats in the european parliament between 1999 and 2004. following the 2004 european elections, the group reformed as independence/democracy (ind/dem).

the european free alliance (efa) is a european political party that consists of various regionalist political parties in europe. member parties advocate either for full political independence and sovereignty, or some form of devolution or self-governance for their country or region. the alliance has generally limited its membership to progressive parties; therefore, only a fraction of european regionalist parties are members of the efa.
since 1999 the efa and the european green party (egp) have joined forces within greens–european free alliance (greens/efa) group in the european parliament, albeit some efa members have joined other groups from time to time.
the efa's youth wing is the european free alliance youth (efay), founded in 2000.
as of 2019, three european regions are led by efa politicians: corsica with gilles simeoni of together for corsica, flanders with geert bourgeois of the new flemish alliance and scotland with nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party.
regionalists have long been represented in the european parliament. in the 1979 election four regionalist parties obtained seats: the scottish national party (snp), the flemish people's union (vu), the brussels-based democratic front of francophones (fdf) and the south tyrolean people's party (svp). the snp, although being predominantly social-democratic, joined the european progressive democrats, a conservative group led by the french rally for the republic. the vu and the fdf joined the heterogeneous technical group of independents, while the svp joined the european people's party group.
in 1981 six parties (vu, the frisian national party, independent fianna fáil, the party of german-speaking belgians, the party for the organization of a free brittany and the alsace-lorraine national association), plus three observers (the union of the corsican people, upc, the occitan party and the democratic convergence of catalonia, cdc), joined forces to form the european free alliance. regionalist meps continued, however, to sit in different groups also after the 1984 election: the snp in the gaullist-dominated european democratic alliance; the vu, the sardinian action party (psd'az) and basque solidarity (ea) in the rainbow group, together with green parties; the svp in the european people's party group; the cdc with the liberal democrats; and batasuna among non-inscrits.
only after the 1989 european parliament election did efa members form a united group, called rainbow like its green predecessor. it consisted of three italian meps (two for lega lombarda and one for the psd'az), two spanish meps (one each for the pnv and the andalusian party, pa), one belgian mep (for vu), one french mep (upc), one british mep (snp) and one independent mep from ireland. they were joined by 4 meps from the danish left-wing eurosceptic people's movement against the eu, while the other regionalist parties, including the svp, batasuna and the convergence and union of catalonia (ciu) declined to join.
in the 1994 european parliament election the regionalists lost many seats. moreover, the efa had suspended its major affiliate, lega nord, for having joined forces in government with the post-fascist national alliance. also, the pnv chose to switch to the european people's party (epp). the three remaining efa meps (representing the snp, the vu and the canarian coalition) formed a group with the french "énergie radicale" list and the italian pannella list: the european radical alliance.
following the 1999 european parliament election, in which efa parties did quite well, efa elected meps formed a joint group with the european green party, under the name greens–european free alliance (greens/efa). in the event the efa supplied ten members: two each from the scottish snp, the welsh plaid cymru, and the flemish vu, and one each from the basque pnv and ea, the andalusian pa and the galician nationalist bloc (bng).
in the 2004 european parliament election, the efa, which had formally become a european political party, was reduced to four meps: two from the snp (ian hudghton and alyn smith), one from plaid cymru (jill evans) and one from the republican left of catalonia (erc; bernat joan i marí, replaced at the mid-term by mep mikel irujo of the basque ea). they were joined by two associate members: tatjana ždanoka of for human rights in united latvia (pctvl) and lászló tőkés, an independent mep and former member of the democratic alliance of hungarians in romania (umdr). co-operation between the efa and the greens continued.
following the 2008 revision of the eu regulation that governs european political parties allowing the creation of european foundations affiliated to european political parties, the efa established its official foundation/think tank, the coppieters foundation (cf), in september 2007.
in the 2009 european parliament election, six meps were returned for the efa: two from the snp (ian hudghton and alyn smith), one from plaid cymru (jill evans), one from the party of the corsican nation (pnc; françois alfonsi), one from the erc (oriol junqueras), and tatjana ždanoka, an individual member of the efa from latvia. after the election, the new flemish alliance (n-va) also joined the efa. the efa subgroup thus counted seven meps.
in the 2014 european parliament election, efa-affiliated parties returned twelve seats to the parliament: four for the n-va, two for the snp, two for "left for the right to decide" (an electoral list primarily composed of the erc), one for "the peoples decide" (an electoral list maily comprising eh bildu, a basque coalition including ea), one for "european spring" (an electoral list comprising the valencian nationalist bloc, bnv, and the aragonese union, cha), one from plaid cymru, and one from the latvian russian union (lks). due to ideological divergences with the flemish greens, the n-va defected to the european conservatives and reformists (ecr) group and the eh bildu mep joined the european united left–nordic green left (gue/ngl) group. thus, efa had seven members in the greens/efa group and four within ecr.
in the 2019 european parliament election the efa gained a fourth seat in the united kingdom, due to the snp gaining a third seat to add to plaid cymru's one. however, the efa is expected to suffer the loss of these seats later in 2019 due to brexit.
in the brussels declaration of 2000 the efa codified its political principles. the efa stands for "a europe of free peoples based on the principle of subsidiarity, which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world." the efa sees itself as an alliance of stateless peoples, striving towards recognition, autonomy, independence or wanting a proper voice in europe. it supports european integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. it believes also that europe should move away from further centralisation and works towards the formation of a "europe of regions". it believes that regions should have more power in europe, for instance participating in the council of the european union, when matters within their competence are discussed. it also wants to protect the linguistic and cultural diversity within the eu.
the efa broadly stands on the left-wing of the political spectrum. the brussels declaration emphasises the protection of human rights, sustainable development and social justice. in 2007 the efa congress in bilbao added several progressive principles to the declaration, including a commitment to fight against racism, antisemitism, discrimination, xenophobia and islamophobia, and a commitment to get full citizenship for immigrants, including voting rights.
efa members are generally progressive, although there are some notable exceptions as the conservative new flemish alliance, bavaria party, schleswig party and future of åland, the christian-democratic slovene union, the centre-right liga veneta repubblica and the far-right south tyrolean freedom.
the main organs of the efa organisation are the general assembly, the bureau and the secretariat.
in the general assembly, the supreme council of the efa, every member party has one vote.
the bureau takes care of daily affairs. it is chaired by lorena lopez de lacalle (basque solidarity), president of the efa, while jordi solé (republican left of catalonia) is secretary-general and anke spoorendonk (south schleswig voters' association) treasurer.
the bureau is completed by ten vice-presidents: marta bainka (silesian autonomy movement), olrik bouma (frisian national party), (future of åland), jill evans (plaid cymru), fernando fuente cortina (valencian nationalist bloc), victor gallou (breton democratic union), david grosclaude (occitan party), wouter patho (new flemish alliance), nelida pogagcic (list for rijeka) and anne tomasi (party of the corsican nation).
before becoming a member party, an organization needs to have been an observer of the efa for at least one year. only one member party per region is allowed. if a second party from a region wants to join the efa, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. the efa also recognises friends of the efa, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the european union.
the following is the list of efa members and former members.

the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe party (alde party) is a european political party composed of 60 national-level liberal parties from across europe, mainly active in the european union. on 26 march 1976, it was founded in stuttgart as a confederation of national political parties under the name federation of liberal and democrat parties in europe and renamed european liberals and democrats (eld) in 1977 and european liberal democrats and reformists (eldr) in 1986. on 30 april 2004, the eldr was reformed as an official european party, the european liberal democrat and reform party (eldr party). the alde party is affiliated with the liberal international and a recognised european political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under belgian law.
on 10 november 2012, the party chose its current name of alde party, taken from its then-european parliament group, the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe (alde), which had been formed on 20 july 2004 in conjunction with the european democratic party (edp). prior to the 2004 european election the european party had been represented through its own group, the european liberal democrat and reform party (eldr) group. in june 2019, the alde group was succeeded by renew europe.
, alde is represented in european union institutions, with 68 meps and 5 members of the european commission. of the 28 eu member states, there are seven with alde-affiliated prime ministers: mark rutte (vvd) in the netherlands, xavier bettel (dp) in luxembourg, jüri ratas (estonian centre party) in estonia, charles michel (mr) in belgium, marjan šarec (lms) in slovenia, andrej babiš (ano) in the czech republic and lars løkke rasmussen (venstre) in denmark. liberals are also in government in four other eu member states: croatia, romania, latvia and lithuania.
alde's think tank is the european liberal forum. the youth wing of alde is the european liberal youth (lymec), which is predominantly based upon youth and student liberal organisations but contains also a small number of individual members. lymec is led by vedrana gujic (hns, croatia), who was elected for a two-year term as lymec president in may 2014, and counts 200,000 members.
the day-to-day management of the alde party is handled by the bureau, the members of which are:
pan-european liberalism has a long history dating back to the foundation of liberal international in april 1947. on 26 march 1976, the federation of liberal and democrat parties in europe was established in stuttgart. the founding parties of the federation were the free democratic party of germany, radical party of france, liberal party of denmark, italian liberal party, dutch people's party for freedom and democracy and democratic party of luxembourg. observer members joining later in 1976 were the danish social liberal party, french radical party of the left and independent republicans, british liberal party, and italian republican party. in 1977, the federation was renamed european liberals and democrats, in 1986, european liberal democrats and reformists.
it evolved into the european liberal democrat and reform party (eldr party) in 2004, when it was founded as an official european party under that name and incorporated under belgian law at an extraordinary congress in brussels, held on 30 april 2004 the day before the enlargement of the european union. at the same time the matching group in the european parliament, the european liberal democrats and reformists group allied with the members of the newly elected european democratic party, forming the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe (alde) with a matching alde group in the european parliament.
on 10 november 2012, the eldr party adopted the name of the alliance between the two parties, in order to match the parliamentary group and the alliance.
on 12 june 2019, the alde group was succeeded by a new, enlarged group renew europe.
alde member parties contribute 5 out of the 28 members of the european commission:

the european people's party group (epp group) is the political group in the european parliament consisting of deputies (meps) from the member parties of the european people's party (epp), other unaffiliated national parties and independent deputies. in this respect, there is a distinction between the european people's party itself (a european-level party of centre-right national political parties from across europe) and the epp group in the european parliament, which is not limited to deputies that belong to epp's member parties. the epp mostly comprises politicians of christian democratic, conservative and liberal-conservative orientation.
the european people's party was officially founded as a european political party in 1976. however, the european people's party group in the european parliament has existed in one form or another since june 1953, from the common assembly of the european coal and steel community, making it one of the oldest european level political groups. its size has given it influence in all the eu's institutions. it has been the largest political group in the european parliament since 1999. in the european council, 9 out of 28 heads of state and government belong to the epp family and in the european commission, 13 out of 27 commissioners come from epp parties.
the common assembly of the european coal and steel community (the predecessor of the present day european parliament) first met on 10 september 1952 and the first christian democratic group was unofficially formed the next day, with maan sassen as president. the group held 38 of the 78 seats, two short of an absolute majority. on 16 june 1953 the common assembly passed a resolution enabling the official formation of political groups, and on 23 june 1953 the constituent declaration of the group was published and the group was officially formed.
the christian democrat group was the biggest group at formation, but as time wore on it lost support and was the second-biggest group by the time of the 1979 elections. as the european community expanded into the european union, the dominant centre-right parties in the new member states were not necessarily christian democratic, and the epp (european people's party, the pan-continental political party founded in 1976 which all group members are now affiliated to) feared being sidelined. to counter this, the epp expanded its remit to cover the centre-right regardless of tradition and pursued a policy of integrating liberal-conservative parties.
this policy led to greek new democracy and spanish people's party meps joining the epp group. the british conservative party and danish conservative people's party tried to maintain a group of their own called the "european democrats" (ed), but lack of support and the problems inherent in maintaining a small group forced ed's collapse in the 1990s, and its members crossed the floor to join the epp group. the parties of these meps also became full members of the epp (with the exception of the british conservatives who did not join the party) and this consolidation process of the european centre-right throughout the 1990s with the acquisition of members from the italian party forza italia. however, the consolidation was not unalloyed and a split emerged with the eurosceptic meps who congregated in a subgroup within the group, also called the "european democrats" (ed).
nevertheless, the consolidation held through the 1990s, assisted by the group being renamed to the "european people's party – european democrats" (epp-ed) group, and after the 1999 european elections the epp-ed reclaimed its position as the largest group in the parliament from the party of european socialists (pes) group.
size was not enough, however: the group did not have a majority. it continued therefore to engage in the "grand coalition" (a coalition with the pes group, or occasionally the liberals) to generate the majorities required by the cooperation procedure under the single european act. this coalition has held, although occasionally the group adopts a government-opposition dynamic with the other groups, notably during the budget crisis when it opposed the pes and brought about the resignation of the santer commission.
meanwhile, the parties in the european democrats subgroup were growing restless and finally left following the 2009 elections, when the czech civic democratic party and british conservative party formed their own right-wing european conservatives and reformists (ecr) group on 22 june 2009, abolishing the european democrats subgroup from that date. the epp-ed group reverted to its original name – the epp group – immediately.
in the 7th european parliament the epp group remains the largest parliamentary group with 275 meps. it is currently the only political group in the european parliament to fully represent its corresponding european political party, i.e. the european people's party. the united kingdom was the only member to not be represented in the group until 28 february 2018, when two meps suspended from the conservative party left the european conservatives and reformists and joined the epp. the two meps later joined a breakaway political party in the uk, the independent group.
after 12 member parties in the epp called for fidesz's expulsion or suspension, fidesz's membership was suspended, leaving the epp group without representation from hungary.
the 38 members in the group on 11 september 1952 were as follows:
the epp group is governed by a collective (referred to as the "presidency") that allocates tasks. the presidency consists of the group chair and a maximum of ten vice-chairs, including the treasurer. the day-to-day running of the epp group is performed by its secretariat in the european parliament, led by its secretary-general. the group runs its own think-tank, the european ideas network, which brings together opinion-formers from across europe to discuss issues facing the european union from a centre-right perspective.
the epp group presidency includes:
the chairs of the group and its predecessors from 1952 to 18 september 2008 are as follows:
the national parties that have members of the epp group are as follows:
the national parties that are currently suspended from the epp group are as follows:
activities performed by the group in the period between june 2004 and june 2008 include monitoring elections in palestine and the ukraine; encouraging transeuropean rail travel, telecoms deregulation, energy security, a common energy policy, the accession of bulgaria and romania to the union, partial reform of the cap and attempts to tackle illegal immigration; denouncing russian involvement in south ossetia; supporting the constitution treaty and the lisbon treaty; debating globalisation, relations with china, and taiwan; backing plans to outlaw holocaust denial; nominating anna politkovskaya for the 2007 sakharov prize; expelling daniel hannan from the group; the discussion about whether ed meps should remain within epp-ed or form a group of their own; criticisms of the group's approach to tackling low turnout for the 2009 elections; the group's use of the two-president arrangement; and the group's proposal to ban the islamic burka dress eu wide.
the debates and votes in the european parliament are tracked by its website and categorized by the groups that participate in them and the rule of procedure that they fall into. the results give a profile for each group by category and the total indicates the group's level of participation in parliamentary debates. the activity profile for each group for the period 1 august 2004 to 1 august 2008 in the sixth parliament is given on the diagram on the right. the group is denoted in blue.
the website shows the group as participating in 659 motions, making it the third most active group during the period.
the group produces many publications, which can be found on its website. documents produced in 2008 cover subjects such as dialogue with the orthodox church, study days, its strategy for 2008-09, euro-mediterranean relations, and the treaty of lisbon. it also publishes a yearbook and irregularly publishes a presentation, a two-page summary of the group.
along with the other political groups, the group has been analysed by academics on its positions regarding various issues. those positions are summarised in this article. that article characterizes the group as a three-quarter male group that, prior to ed's departure, was only 80% cohesive and split between centre-right europhiles (the larger epp subgroup) and right-wing eurosceptics (the smaller ed subgroup). that article characterized the group as a whole as ambiguous on hypothetical eu taxes, against taxation, green issues, social liberal issues (lgbt rights, abortion, euthanasia) and full turkish accession to the european union, and for a deeper federal europe, deregulation, the common foreign and security policy and controlling migration into the eu.

the european united left/nordic green left (, gue/ngl) is a left-wing political group in the european parliament established in 1995.
the group comprises political parties of socialist and communist orientation.
in 1995, the enlargement of the european union led to the creation of the nordic green left group of parties. the nordic green left (ngl) merged with the confederal group of the european united left (gue) on 6 january 1995, forming the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left. the ngl suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of swedish and finnish meps. the group initially consisted of meps from the finnish left alliance, the swedish left party, the danish socialist people's party, the united left of spain (including the spanish communist party), the synaspismos of greece, the french communist party, the portuguese communist party, the communist party of greece and the communist refoundation party of italy.
in 1999, the german party of democratic socialism (pds) and the greek democratic social movement (dikki) joined as full members while the five meps elected from the list of the french trotskyist alliance lo–lcr joined as associate members.
in 2002, four meps from the french citizen and republican movement also joined the group.
in 2004, no meps were elected from lo–lcr and dikki—which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution—did not put forward candidates. meps from the portuguese left bloc, the irish sinn féin, the progressive party of working people of cyprus and the communist party of bohemia and moravia joined the group.
in 2019, no meps were elected from the french communist party or from the italian parties the left and communist refoundation party.
according to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present european union political structure, but it is committed to integration. that declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another european union, namely the total change of institutions to make them fully democratic, breaking with neo-liberal monetarist policies, and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. the group wants to disband the north atlantic treaty organisation (nato) and strengthen the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce).
the group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. as such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as insiders within the european institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision; and as outsiders by its willingness to seek another europe which would abolish the maastricht treaty.
the gue/ngl is a confederal group who is composed of meps from national parties. those national parties must share common political objectives with the group as specified in the group's constituent declaration. nevertheless, those national parties and not the group retain control of their meps, therefore the group may be divided on certain issues.
members of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions. the group also publishes reports on various topics.
meps may be full or associate members.
national parties may be full or associate members.
the initial member parties for the 9th european parliament was determined at the first meeting on the 29th of may 2019.

the european democrats was a loose association of conservative political parties in europe. it was a political group in the european parliament from 1979 until 1992, when it became a subgroup of the european people's party–european democrats (epp-ed) group. the european democrats continued to exist as a political group in the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe (pace) until 2014, when it became the european conservatives group.
the european democratic group (ed) was formed on 17 july 1979 by british conservative party, danish conservative people's party and other meps after their success in the 1979 elections. it supplanted the earlier european conservative group.
in the late seventies and early eighties, the ed was the third-largest political group in the european parliament.
however, the group saw its membership fall sharply in the late 1980s, as many centre-right members moved to the rival european people's party (epp), dominated by the christian democratic union of germany (cdu), italian christian democrats and the ideology of christian democracy in general. the ed had been somewhat further from the political centre and less pro-european than the epp. largely isolated, even hardline eurosceptics like margaret thatcher conceded that the british conservatives could not be effectively heard from such a peripheral group.
on 1 may 1992, the ed (now largely composed of uk conservative party members) dissolved, and its remaining members were accorded "associated party" status in the european people's party group; that is, being part of the parliamentary group without retaining actual membership in the epp europarty organisation. this was considered essential for the conservatives, as the epp was generally seen as quite favourable to european integration, a stance at odds with their core ideology. the conservatives' relationship to the epp would become a sore point in the following years, particularly for the eurosceptic general membership in britain. then-leader of the british conservative party william hague hoped to put the issue to rest by negotiating a new arrangement in 1999 by which the epp's parliamentary group would rebrand itself as the european people's party–european democrats (epp-ed), with the "european democrat" nomenclature returning after a seven-year hiatus. this was intended to nominally underscore the conservatives' status apart from the rest of epp, and it was hoped that with the coming enlargement of the european union numerous newly involved right-wing parties, averse to the epp proper for its perceived european federalism, would be willing to instead enter the ed subgroup, growing the overall alignment.
the arrangement proved to do little to appease opposition. hague's successor, iain duncan smith, made a concerted drive at one point to resurrect the european democratic group, but backed off when it became clear that conservative meps would not move voluntarily. the hope that multiple central and european parties would join ed also proved to be dubious, as only the czech civic democratic party took up the offer, with the remainder joining epp proper or other groups such as union for europe of the nations (uen) or independence and democracy (ind/dem). meanwhile, the ed remained a more eurosceptic subgroup within the broader epp-ed bloc that contributed slightly more than 10% of its total meps. it resisted the trend of incorporating as a european political party.
during the 2005 conservative leadership contest, eventual winner david cameron pledged to withdraw the conservatives from the epp-ed group, while opponent david davis argued in a letter to the editor of the daily telegraph that the current ed arrangement allowed the conservatives to maintain suitable distance from epp while still having influence in the largest parliamentary grouping. conservative/epp-ed mep martin callanan responded in that paper the following day:
the czech civic democratic party (ods), the law and justice (pis) of poland and the rally for france party were among the first to discuss forming a breakaway group under the movement for european reform. sir reg empey, leader of the ulster unionist party (uup) has committed his party thereunto its position would be that the european union should exist, but as a looser supranational organisation than at present, making the group less eurosceptic than the uen and ind/dem groups. some members from the above parties founded a new organization, the alliance for an open europe, in the midst of this debate, with broadly similar objectives.
cameron initially intended to form the new group in 2006, though this aspiration had to be cancelled due to their main prospective partners, the ods and pis, being unable or unwilling to break away from their then-groupings; the new grouping was put on hiatus until the 2009 european elections. by then, new factors—including the collapse of the uen group—made conditions for forming a new political grouping much more favourable. on 22 june 2009, the founder members of the european conservatives and reformists (ecr) group, all signatories of the prague declaration announced that they were to leave the epp-ed, and in virtue of that fact, the european democrats movement. this announcement ended the 30-year existence of the european democrats in the european parliament.
the following political parties were associated with the european democrats at some point:
the european democrat group in the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe was founded as the group of independent representatives in 1970 by british and scandinavian members of pace, having about 35–40 members from the uk, ireland, norway, denmark, turkey, sweden and switzerland. it adopted the european democrats group name in september 1980, later becoming the european conservatives group in 2014.

the epistle to the ephesians, also called the letter to the ephesians and often shortened to ephesians, is the tenth book of the new testament. its authorship has traditionally been attributed to paul the apostle but starting in 1792, this has been challenged as deutero-pauline, that is, written in paul's name by a later author strongly influenced by paul's thought, probably "by a loyal disciple to sum up paul’s teaching and to apply it to a new situation fifteen to twenty-five years after the apostle’s death.
according to new testament scholar daniel wallace, the theme may be stated pragmatically as "christians, get along with each other! maintain the unity practically which christ has effected positionally by his death."
another major theme in ephesians is the keeping of christ's body (that is, the church) pure and holy.
in the second part of the letter, ephesians 4:17–6:20, the author gives practical advice in how to live a holy, pure, and christ-inspired lifestyle.
according to tradition, the apostle paul wrote the letter while he was in prison in rome (around ad 62). this would be about the same time as the epistle to the colossians (which in many points it resembles) and the epistle to philemon. however, many critical scholars have questioned the authorship of the letter and suggest that it may have been written between ad 80 and 100.
the first verse in the letter identifies paul as its author. while early lists of new testament books, including marcion's canon and the muratorian fragment, attribute the letter to paul, more recently there have been challenges to pauline authorship on the basis of the letter's characteristically non-pauline syntax, terminology, and eschatology.
biblical scholar harold hoehner, surveying 279 commentaries written between 1519 and 2001, found that 54% favored pauline authorship, 39% concluded against pauline authorship and 7% remained uncertain. norman perrin and dennis c. duling found that of six authoritative scholarly references, "four of the six decide for pseudonymity, and the other two (pcb and jbc) recognize the difficulties in maintaining pauline authorship. indeed, the difficulties are insurmountable." bible scholar raymond e. brown asserts that about 80% of critical scholarship judges that paul did not write ephesians.
there are four main theories in biblical scholarship that address the question of pauline authorship.
while most english translations indicate that the letter was addressed to "the saints who are in ephesus" (1:1), the words "in ephesus" do not appear in the best and earliest manuscripts of the letter, leading most textual critics, like bart ehrman, to regard the words as an interpolation. this lack of any internal references to ephesus in the early manuscripts may have led marcion, a second-century heresiarch who created the first new testament canon, to believe that the letter was actually addressed to the church at laodicea, for details see epistle to the laodiceans. the view is not uncommon in later traditions either, considering that the content of the letter seems to suggest a similar socio-critical context to the laodicean church mentioned in the revelation of john.
furthermore, if paul is regarded as the author, the impersonal character of the letter, which lacks personal greetings or any indication that the author has personal knowledge of his recipients, is incongruous with the account in acts of paul staying more than two years in ephesus. for these reasons, most regard ephesians to be a circular letter intended for many churches. the jerusalem bible notes that some critics think the words "who are ..." would have been followed by a blank to be filled in with the name of "whichever church was being sent the letter".
if paul was the author of the letter, then it was probably written from rome during paul's first imprisonment (; ; ), and probably soon after his arrival there in the year 62, four years after he had parted with the ephesian elders at miletus. however, scholars who dispute paul's authorship date the letter to between 70–80 ad. in the latter case, the possible location of the authorship could have been within the church of ephesus itself. ignatius of antioch himself seemed to be very well versed in the epistle to the ephesians, and mirrors many of his own thoughts in his own epistle to the ephesians.
the major theme of the letter is the unity and reconciliation of the whole of creation through the agency of the church and, in particular, its foundation in christ as part of the will of the father.
in the epistle to the romans, the author writes from the point of view of the demonstration of the righteousness of god—his covenant faithfulness and saving justice—in the gospel; the author of ephesians writes from the perspective of union with christ, who is the head of the true church.
ephesians contains:
paul's first and hurried visit for the space of three months to ephesus is recorded in . the work he began on this occasion was carried forward by apollos and aquila and priscilla. on his second visit early in the following year, he remained at ephesus "three years", for he found it was the key to the western provinces of asia minor. here "a great door and effectual" was opened to him, and the church was established and strengthened by his diligent labours there. from ephesus the gospel spread abroad "almost throughout all asia." the word "mightily grew and prevailed" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.
on his last journey to jerusalem, the apostle landed at miletus and, summoning together the elders of the church from ephesus, delivered to them a farewell charge, expecting to see them no more.
the following parallels between this epistle and the milesian charge may be traced:
the purpose of the epistle, and to whom it was written, are matters of much speculation. it was regarded by c.h. dodd as the "crown of paulinism." in general, it is born out of its particular socio-historical context and the situational context of both the author and the audience. originating in the circumstance of a multicultural church (primarily jewish and hellenistic), the author addressed issues appropriate to the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds present in the community.
the author exhorts the church repeatedly to embrace a specific view of salvation, which he then explicates. it seems most likely that the author's christology of sacrifice is the manner in which he intends to effect an environment of peace within the church. in short: "if christ was sacrificed for your sake, be like him and be in submission to one another." the author addresses hostility, division, and self-interest more than any other topic in the letter, leading many scholars to believe that his primary concern was not doctrinal, but behavioral.
some theologians, such as frank charles thompson, agree the main theme of ephesians is in response to the newly converted jews who often separated themselves from their gentile brethren. the unity of the church, especially between jew and gentile believers, is the keynote of the book. this is shown by the recurrence of such words and phrases as:
together: made alive together; raised up together, sitting together; built together.
one, indicating unity: one new man, one body, one spirit, one hope, one lord, one faith, one baptism, one god and father of all.
the pauline theme of unity based on a sacrificial christology may also be noted in the epistle to the philippians.
ephesians is notable for its domestic code treatment in , covering husband-wife, parent-child, and master-slave relationships. in , wives are urged to submit to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives "as christ loved the church." christian egalitarian theologians, such as katharine bushnell and jessie penn-lewis, interpret these commands in the context of the preceding verse, for all christians to "submit to one another." thus, it is two-way, mutual submission of both husbands to wives and wives to husbands. but according to peter o'brien, professor emeritus at moore theological college, this would be the only instance of this meaning of submission in the whole new testament, indeed in any extant comparable greek texts; by o'brien's account, the word simply does not connote mutuality. dallas theological seminary professor daniel wallace understands it to be an extension of on being filled by the holy spirit.
in the period leading up to the american civil war (1861–65), on master-slave relationships was one of the bible verses used by confederate slaveholders in support of a slaveholding position.

electric bus is a bus powered by electric energy. "electric bus" can also refer to:

an exploit (from the english verb "to exploit", meaning "to use something to one’s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (dos or related ddos) attack.
there are several methods of classifying exploits. the most common is by how the exploit communicates to the vulnerable software.
a "remote exploit" works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.
a "local exploit" requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application.
exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples.
many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. however, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches the highest administrative level (often called "root").
after an exploit is made known to the authors of the affected software, the vulnerability is often fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes unusable. that is the reason why some black hat hackers as well as military or intelligence agencies hackers do not publish their exploits but keep them private.
exploits unknown to everyone but the people that found and developed them are referred to as "zero day exploits".
exploitations are commonly categorized and named by the type of vulnerability they exploit (see vulnerabilities for a list), whether they are local/remote and the result of running the exploit (e.g. eop, dos, spoofing).
pivoting refers to a method used by penetration testers that uses the compromised system to attack other systems on the same network to avoid restrictions such as firewall configurations, which may prohibit direct access to all machines. for example, if an attacker compromises a web server on a corporate network, the attacker can then use the compromised web server to attack other systems on the network. these types of attacks are often called multi-layered attacks. pivoting is also known as "island hopping".
pivoting can further be distinguished into proxy pivoting and vpn pivoting. proxy pivoting generally describes the practice of channeling traffic through a compromised target using a proxy payload on the machine and launching attacks from the computer. this type of pivoting is restricted to certain tcp and udp ports that are supported by the proxy.
vpn pivoting enables the attacker to create an encrypted layer to tunnel into the compromised machine to route any network traffic through that target machine, for example, to run a vulnerability scan on the internal network through the compromised machine, effectively giving the attacker full network access as if they were behind the firewall.
typically, the proxy or vpn applications enabling pivoting are executed on the target computer as the payload (software) of an exploit.
pivoting is usually done by infiltrating a part of a network infrastructure (as an example, a vulnerable printer or thermostat) and using a scanner to find other devices connected to attack them. by attacking a vulnerable piece of networking, an attacker could infect most or all of a network and gain complete control.

the erg is a unit of energy and work equal to 10 joules. it originated in the centimetre–gram–second (cgs) system of units. it has the symbol "erg". the erg is not an si unit. its name is derived from (), a greek word meaning "work" or "task".
an erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimeter. in the cgs base units, it is equal to one gram centimeter-squared per second-squared (g⋅cm/s). it is thus equal to 10 joules or 100 nanojoules (nj) in si units. an erg is approximately the amount of work done (or energy consumed) by one common house fly performing one "push up", the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up.
in 1864, rudolf clausius proposed the greek word () for the unit of energy, work and heat. in 1873, a committee of the british association for the advancement of science, including british physicists james clerk maxwell and william thomson recommended the general adoption of the centimetre, the gramme, and the second as fundamental units (c.g.s. system of units). to distinguish derived units, they recommended using the prefix ""c.g.s. unit of ..."" and requested that the word "erg" or "ergon" be strictly limited to refer to the "c.g.s. unit of energy".
in 1922, chemist william draper harkins proposed the name micri-erg as a convenient unit to measure the surface energy of molecules in surface chemistry. it would equate to 10 erg, the equivalent to 10 joule.
the erg has not been a valid unit since 1 january 1978 when the eec ratified a directive of 1971 which implemented the international system (si) as agreed by the general conference of weights and measures. it is still widely used in astrophysics and sometimes in mechanics.

everway is a fantasy role-playing game first published by wizards of the coast under their alter ego brand in the mid-1990s. its lead designer was jonathan tweet. marketed as a "visionary roleplaying game", it has often been characterized as an innovative piece with a limited commercial success. wizards later abandoned the line, and rubicon games purchased it, and published several supplements. the line was sold again to gaslight press in february 2001.
the game has a fantasy setting of the multiverse type, with many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. it appears to have been heavily influenced by divinatory tarot, the four classical elements of ancient greece, and mythologies from around the world.
everway was first with implementing, in a commercial game, several new concepts including much more picture-based/visual source material and character creation than usual. like other works by jonathan tweet, the rules are very simple and flexible. it is also one of a few diceless role-playing games. the fortune deck works as a randomizer and inspirational tool, and the results obtained by it are highly subjective. in order to clarify their use, tweet coined some new vocabulary to describe and formalize methods of gamemaster adjudication; these terms have been adopted by the wider tabletop rpg community. tweet's adjudication terms are: karma (making a decision based on character abilities, tactics, and the internal logic of a fictional situation), drama (making a decision based on what moves the story along), and fortune (letting a randomizer — drawing a card in "everway", but could also refer to rolling dice in other games — determine the outcome). the original edition contained the "fortune" deck of thirty-six cards, used for "divination" and action-resolution, as well as ninety "vision" cards used as source material. each vision card depicts a fantastic scene of some sort and is backed with a series of leading questions such as, "what does this person most enjoy?" or "what's the worst thing that could happen in this situation?" the game's box also had three books of source material and game-playing tips: a player's guide, game master's guide, and guide to the fortune deck.
the fortune cards were illustrated by scott kirschner and jeff miracola.
the official setting for everway revolves around heroes with the power of "spherewalking," traveling between worlds called "spheres." spheres typically consist of many "realms." the city of everway is located in a realm called roundwander, in the sphere called fourcorner. roundwander is the only realm in fourcorner that is described. there is some detail on the sphere's main city, everway, which contains a stone pyramid, a set of family-oriented guilds, and various exotic events related to the city's position as an inter-dimensional trading center. several dozen other spheres are described as one-sentence blurbs, a few as page-long summaries, and one in detail as the setting for a sample adventure, "journey to stonekeep." the theme is strongly fantasy-oriented as opposed to science fictional, with advanced technology explicitly forbidden in the character creation rules. the authors gave significant thought to anthropology by describing how the people of various spheres live, including many similarities across cultures. some of these common features are entirely realistic (language, art), and others plainly related to the game's fantasy elements (magic, knowledge of the fortune deck). nearly all spheres are inhabited by humans, with mostly realistic physics.
character design is abstract and simple by most role-playing games' standards. each character begins with twenty points to divide between four element scores roughly equivalent to statistics for strength (fire), perception (water), intelligence (air) and endurance (earth). scores range from 1 (pathetic) to 3 (average) to 10 (godlike), so a generic hero would have scores of 5. each element also has a specialty for which a character can get a 1-point bonus; e.g., a 5-air hero with an air specialty of "writing" could write as though their air score were 6. as a general rule a statistic of n is twice as capable as a level of n-1, where this makes sense. (a 5-fire, 5-earth hero can typically defeat two 4-fire, 5-earth enemies, or handily defeat a 3-fire, 5-earth character in foot race, but cannot necessarily run twice as fast even though speed is governed by fire.)
each character also has powers representing unusual abilities. these cost from 0 to 3 or more points depending on whether they should be considered frequent, major (or even "twice major", for especially powerful abilities that significantly affect gameplay) and/or versatile. for instance, a "cat familiar," a slightly intelligent cat, is arguably worth 2 points for being frequent (usually around and often useful) and versatile (able to scout, carry messages, and fight). a "winning smile" that makes the hero likable is worth 0 points because of its trivial effect, while a "charming song" that inspires one emotion when played might be useful enough to count as frequent (1 point). there is no strict rule for deciding what a power is worth. each hero can have one 0-point power for free; additional powers that would otherwise cost 0 points instead cost 1.
magic is also abstract. a hero wanting access to magic, as opposed to a few specific powers, must design their own magic system. this is done by choosing an element for its basis, which affects its theme; e.g., air is associated with speech and intellect and would be suitable for a system of spoken spells gained through study. the new magic statistic has a 1–10 rating and point cost, and can be no higher than the element on what it is based. the game's rules suggest listing examples of what the magic system can do at each power level, working these out with the gm. it is suggested that most characters do not need magic and that it is not suitable for new players.
finally, each hero has personality traits based on the game's fortune and vision cards. players are to choose one or more vision cards and base a backstory on them, and to have three fortune cards representing a virtue, fault, and fate (a challenge they will face). these three cards can change to represent new phases in the hero's life. there is a list of suggested motives for why the hero is adventuring, such as "adversity" or "wanderlust", but this feature has no gameplay effect.
equipment such as weaponry is handled completely abstractly, with no specific rules for item cost, carrying capacity, or combat statistics. however, a particularly powerful piece of equipment—for example, a cloak that renders its wearer invisible for a brief period—may be treated as a power that the hero must spend their initial element points on.
to decide what happens, the gm considers the rules of karma (characters' abilities, tactics, logic), drama (the needs of the plot), and fortune, the result of a card drawn from the fortune deck. many of these cards are based on the "major arcana" of tarot divination, such as "the fool" and "death", but the deck includes original cards such as "drowning in armor" and "law." as with the tarot deck there is symbolic art and each card has two complementary meanings when upright or reversed (while face up). the meanings are printed on the cards (e.g., "protective measures turn dangerous" vs. "true prudence" for "drowning in armor") and explained more fully in the game's books. the rules are flexible about how often the gm should consult the fortune deck, whether the cards should be shown to players, and how much influence the draw should have—it is entirely acceptable for the gm to never use the deck at all, if she so desires. though cards sometimes have obvious interpretations for the context in which they are drawn, the rules explain that sometimes they are best read simply as "a positive (or negative) result."
although the fortune deck resembles (and can be used as) a fortune-telling device, everway treats the deck only as a storytelling device and an element of the fictional setting. it does not in any way endorse "real" fortune-telling or other supernatural concepts.

eurocard is a european standard format for printed circuit board (pcb) cards that can be plugged together into a standard chassis which, in turn, can be mounted in a 19-inch rack. the chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. at the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis.
as the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: a card might be 233.35 mm "high", but only 20 mm "wide". height is measured in rack units, "u", with 1 u being . this dimension refers to the subrack in which the card is to be mounted, rather than the card itself.
enclosure heights are multiples of 3u, with the cards always shorter than the enclosure. two common heights are 3u (a 100 mm card in a subrack) and 6u (a 233.35 mm card in a high subrack). as two 3u cards are shorter than a 6u card (by 33.35 mm), it is possible to install two 3u cards in one slot of a 6u subrack, with a mid-height structure for proper support.
card widths are specified in horizontal pitch units "hp", with 1 hp being .
card depths start at and increase in increments. the most common today is , but standard hardware is available for depths of , , , , , and .
the eurocard mechanical architecture was defined originally under iec-60297-3. today, the most widely recognized standards for this mechanical structure are ieee 1101.1, ieee 1101.10 (also known commonly as "dot ten") and ieee 1101.11. ieee 1101.10 covers the additional mechanical and electromagnetic interference features required for vita 1.1-1997(r2002), which is the vme64 extensions standard, as well as picmg 2.0 (r3.0), which is the compactpci specification.
the ieee 1101.11 standard covers rear plug-in units that are also called rear transition modules or rtms.
the eurocard is a mechanical system and does not define the specific connector to be used or the signals that are assigned to connector contacts.
the connector systems that are commonly used with eurocard architectures include the original din 41612 connector that is also standardized as iec 60603.2. this is the connector that is used for the vmebus standard, which was ieee 1014. the connector known as the 5-row din, which is used for the vme64 extensions standard is iec 61076-4-113. the vme64 extension architecture defined by vita 1.1-1997 (r2002).
another popular computer architecture that utilizes the 6u-160 eurocard is compactpci and compactpci express. these are defined by picmg 2.0r3 and picmg exp0 r1 respectively. other computer architectures that utilize the eurocard system are vme extensions for instrumentation (vxi), pci extensions for instrumentation (pxi), and pxi express.
a computer architecture that used the 6u-220 eurocard format was multibus-ii, which was ieee 1296.
because the eurocard system provided for so many modular card sizes and because connector manufacturers have continued to create new connectors that are compatible with this system, it is a popular mechanical standard that is also used for innumerable "one-off" applications.
conduction-cooled eurocards are used in military and aerospace applications. they are defined by the ieee 1101.2-1992 (2001) standard.
the eurocard standard is also the basis of the "eurorack" format for modular electronic music synthesizers, popularized by doepfer and other manufacturers.

electron counting is a formalism used for classifying compounds and for explaining or predicting electronic structure and bonding. many rules in chemistry rely on electron-counting:
atoms are called "electron-deficient" when they have too few electrons as compared to their respective rules, or "hypervalent" when they have too many electrons. since these compounds tend to be more reactive than compounds that obey their rule, electron counting is an important tool for identifying the reactivity of molecules.
two methods of electron counting are popular and both give the same result.
it is important, though, to be aware that most chemical species exist between the purely covalent and ionic extremes.
the numbers of electrons "donated" by some ligands depends on the geometry of the metal-ligand ensemble. an example of this complication is the m–no entity. when this grouping is linear, the no ligand is considered to be a three-electron ligand. when the m–no subunit is strongly bent at n, the no is treated as a pseudohalide and is thus a one electron (in the neutral counting approach). the situation is not very different from the "η" versus the "η" allyl. another unusual ligand from the electron counting perspective is sulfur dioxide.
these examples show the methods of electron counting, they are a "formalism", and don't have anything to do with "real life" chemical transformations. most of the 'fragments' mentioned above do not exist as such; they cannot be kept in a bottle: e.g. the neutral c, the tetraanionic c, the neutral ti, and the tetracationic ti are not "free" species, they are always bound to something, for neutral c, it is commonly found in graphite, charcoal, diamond (sharing electrons with the neighboring carbons), as for ti which can be found as its metal (where it shares its electrons with neighboring ti atoms), c and ti 'exist' only with appropriate counterions (with which they probably share electrons). so these formalisms are only used to predict stabilities or properties of compounds!

in statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. it is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy formula_1 is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the boltzmann constant . formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),
macroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations. for example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules . the number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly (the avogadro number). at equilibrium, each of the configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely.
the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. in the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.
because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. for this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. the concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory.
boltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have dimensions of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (j⋅k) in the international system of units (or kg⋅m⋅s⋅k in terms of base units). the entropy of a substance is usually given as an intensive property—either entropy per unit mass (si unit: j⋅k⋅kg) or entropy per unit amount of substance (si unit: j⋅k⋅mol).
the french mathematician lazare carnot proposed in his 1803 paper "fundamental principles of equilibrium and movement" that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of "moment of activity". in other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. building on this work, in 1824 lazare's son sadi carnot published "reflections on the motive power of fire" which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever "caloric" (what is now known as heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. he made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel. this was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century "newtonian hypothesis" that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of count rumford who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined. carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state at the end of a complete engine cycle, that "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".
the first law of thermodynamics, deduced from the heat-friction experiments of james joule in 1843, expresses the concept of energy, and its conservation in all processes; the first law, however, is unable to quantify the effects of friction and dissipation.
in the 1850s and 1860s, german physicist rudolf clausius objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body, and gave this "change" a mathematical interpretation by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done, e.g. heat produced by friction. clausius described entropy as the "transformation-content", i.e. dissipative energy use, of a thermodynamic system or working body of chemical species during a change of state. this was in contrast to earlier views, based on the theories of isaac newton, that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass.
later, scientists such as ludwig boltzmann, josiah willard gibbs, and james clerk maxwell gave entropy a statistical basis. in 1877 boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. henceforth, the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics, i.e. according to erwin schrödinger, has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy "e" over "n" identical systems.
carathéodory linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.
there are two related definitions of entropy: the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition. historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. in the classical thermodynamics viewpoint, the system is composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) and the state of the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. the early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. the classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. later, the thermodynamic properties, including entropy, were given an alternative definition in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modeled at first classically, e.g. newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). the statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics becomes an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of a system that is subject to some process.
there are many thermodynamic properties that are functions of state. this means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. for instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific volume that is determined by those values. as another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy. the fact that entropy is a function of state is one reason it is useful. in the carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the line integral of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.
entropy is conserved for a reversible process. a reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible. in these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost. more specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process. for example, in the carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the "total" entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. an irreversible process increases entropy.
the concept of entropy arose from rudolf clausius's study of the carnot cycle. in a carnot cycle, heat is absorbed isothermally at temperature from a 'hot' reservoir and given up isothermally as heat to a 'cold' reservoir at . according to carnot's principle, work can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed (). carnot did not distinguish between and , since he was using the incorrect hypothesis that caloric theory was valid, and hence heat was conserved (the incorrect assumption that and were equal) when, in fact, is greater than . through the efforts of clausius and kelvin, it is now known that the maximum work that a heat engine can produce is the product of the carnot efficiency and the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:
to derive the carnot efficiency, which is (a number less than one), kelvin had to evaluate the ratio of the work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion with the help of the carnot–clapeyron equation which contained an unknown function, known as the carnot function. the possibility that the carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by joule in a letter to kelvin. this allowed kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale. it is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:
since the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle. the state function was called the internal energy and it became the first law of thermodynamics.
now equating () and () gives
or
this implies that there is a function of state which is conserved over a complete cycle of the carnot cycle. clausius called this state function "entropy". one can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. it is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. this makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.
clausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by carnot's principle. the right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality
when the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get
so more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the carnot cycle. if we denote the entropies by for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy
the entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the carnot equation.
the carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system. other cycles, such as the otto cycle, diesel cycle and brayton cycle, can be analyzed from the standpoint of the carnot cycle. any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. for very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. the efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.
the thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by rudolf clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the carnot cycle. heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). this relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.
while clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases for irreversible processes. the difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may "not" flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.
according to the clausius equality, for a reversible cyclic process:
formula_10
this means the line integral formula_11 is path-independent.
so we can define a state function called entropy, which satisfies
formula_12
clausius coined the name "entropy" () for in 1865. he gives "transformational content" () as a synonym, paralleling his "thermal and ergonal content" () as the name of , but preferring the term "entropy" as a close parallel of "energy", formed by replacing the root of "work" by that of "transformation".
to find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states. since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states. however, the entropy change of the surroundings will be different.
we can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. to obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the third law of thermodynamics, which states that "s" = 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals.
from a macroscopic perspective, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. in any process where the system gives up energy δ"e", and its entropy falls by δ"s", a quantity at least "t" δ"s" of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat ("t" is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). otherwise the process cannot go forward. in classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.
the statistical definition was developed by ludwig boltzmann in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor which has since been known as boltzmann's constant. in summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.
the interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or "mixedupness" in the phrase of gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. for a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. in contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. the more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. in statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of "disorder" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). this definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. the constant of proportionality is the boltzmann constant.
specifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:
or, equivalently, the expected value of the logarithm of the probability that a microstate will be occupied
where "k" is the boltzmann constant, equal to .
the summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and "p" is the probability that the system is in the "i"-th microstate. this definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases. in a different basis set, the more general expression is
where formula_16 is the density matrix, formula_17 is trace and formula_18 is the matrix logarithm. this density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. for most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for "s" can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.
in what has been called "the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics" or "the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics", the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. "p" = 1/ω, where ω is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium. then the previous equation reduces to
in thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the microcanonical ensemble).
the most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. the equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system. this uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.
the interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. the qualifier "for a given set of macroscopic variables" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. for example, if observer a uses the variables "u", "v" and "w", and observer b uses "u", "v", "w", "x", then, by changing "x", observer b can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer a. in other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!
entropy can be defined for any markov processes with reversible dynamics and the detailed balance property.
in boltzmann's 1896 "lectures on gas theory", he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.
entropy arises directly from the carnot cycle. it can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. entropy is a fundamental function of state.
in a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.
as an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. in other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.
however, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. in an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. thus, when the "universe" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. the entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.
thermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. for isolated systems, entropy never decreases. this fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits "perpetual motion" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.
unlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (j/k) in the international system of units. while these are the same units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. the second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.
one dictionary definition of entropy is that it is "a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work". for instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. a substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.
a special case of entropy increase, the entropy of mixing, occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. if the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work – the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances. at a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing.
the second law of thermodynamics requires that, in general, the total entropy of any system can't decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system. hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. it follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. as a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual motion system. it follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.
it follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. an air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. the heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.
in mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the fundamental thermodynamic relation places limits on a system's ability to do useful work. the entropy change of a system at temperature "t" absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat "δq"
in a reversible way, is given by "δq"/"t". more explicitly, an energy is not available to do useful work, where "t" is the temperature of the coldest accessible reservoir or heat sink external to the system. for further discussion, see "exergy".
statistical mechanics demonstrates that entropy is governed by probability, thus allowing for a decrease in disorder even in an isolated system. although this is possible, such an event has a small probability of occurring, making it unlikely.
the applicability of a second law of thermodynamics is limited to systems which are near or in equilibrium state. at the same time, laws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are still debatable. one of the guiding principles for such systems is the maximum entropy production principle. it claims that non-equilibrium systems evolve such as to maximize its entropy production.
the entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters, such as its volume. in the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy "u" to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. this relation is known as the "fundamental thermodynamic relation". if external pressure "p" bears on the volume "v" as the only external parameter, this relation is:
since both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature "t", implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).
the fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. important examples are the maxwell relations and the relations between heat capacities.
thermodynamic entropy is central in chemical thermodynamics, enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system – the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings – increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. the clausius equation of δ"q"/"t" = δ"s" introduces the measurement of entropy change, δ"s". entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems – always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.
the thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit joule per kelvin (j/k) in the international system of units (si).
thermodynamic entropy is an extensive property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. in many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an intensive property independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the kilogram (unit: j⋅kg⋅k). alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one mole of substance, in which case it is called the "molar entropy" with a unit of j⋅mol⋅k.
thus, when one mole of substance at about is warmed by its surroundings to , the sum of the incremental values of "q"/"t" constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at . entropy change also measures the mixing of substances as a summation of their relative quantities in the final mixture.
entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. for such applications, δ"s" must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings, δ"s" = δ"s" + δ"s" . this expression becomes, via some steps, the gibbs free energy equation for reactants and products in the system: δ"g" [the gibbs free energy change of the system] = δ"h" [the enthalpy change] − "t" δ"s" [the entropy change].
in chemical engineering, the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to "open systems", i.e. those in which heat, work, and mass flow across the system boundary. flows of both heat (formula_21) and work, i.e. formula_22 (shaft work) and "p"("dv"/"dt") (pressure-volume work), across the system boundaries, in general cause changes in the entropy of the system. transfer as heat entails entropy transfer formula_23 where "t" is the absolute thermodynamic temperature of the system at the point of the heat flow. if there are mass flows across the system boundaries, they also influence the total entropy of the system. this account, in terms of heat and work, is valid only for cases in which the work and heat transfers are by paths physically distinct from the paths of entry and exit of matter from the system.
to derive a generalized entropy balanced equation, we start with the general balance equation for the change in any extensive quantity θ in a thermodynamic system, a quantity that may be either conserved, such as energy, or non-conserved, such as entropy. the basic generic balance expression states that dθ/dt, i.e. the rate of change of θ in the system, equals the rate at which θ enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which θ leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which θ is generated within the system. for an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter, using this generic balance equation, with respect to the rate of change with time "t" of the extensive quantity entropy "s", the entropy balance equation is:
where
note, also, that if there are multiple heat flows, the term formula_29 is replaced by formula_30 where formula_31 is the heat flow and formula_32 is the temperature at the "j"th heat flow port into the system.
for certain simple transformations in systems of constant composition, the entropy changes are given by simple formulas.
for the expansion (or compression) of an ideal gas from an initial volume formula_33 and pressure formula_34 to a final volume formula_35 and pressure formula_36 at any constant temperature, the change in entropy is given by:
here formula_38 is the number of moles of gas and formula_39 is the ideal gas constant. these equations also apply for expansion into a finite vacuum or a throttling process, where the temperature, internal energy and enthalpy for an ideal gas remain constant.
for heating or cooling of any system (gas, liquid or solid) at constant pressure from an initial temperature formula_40 to a final temperature formula_41, the entropy change is
provided that the constant-pressure molar heat capacity (or specific heat) "c" is constant and that no phase transition occurs in this temperature interval.
similarly at constant volume, the entropy change is
where the constant-volume heat capacity c is constant and there is no phase change.
at low temperatures near absolute zero, heat capacities of solids quickly drop off to near zero, so the assumption of constant heat capacity does not apply.
since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of any process in which temperature and volume both vary is the same as for a path divided into two steps – heating at constant volume and expansion at constant temperature. for an ideal gas, the total entropy change is
similarly if the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas both vary,
reversible phase transitions occur at constant temperature and pressure. the reversible heat is the enthalpy change for the transition, and the entropy change is the enthalpy change divided by the thermodynamic temperature. for fusion (melting) of a solid to a liquid at the melting point "t", the entropy of fusion is
similarly, for vaporization of a liquid to a gas at the boiling point "t", the entropy of vaporization is
as a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics and physics, several different approaches to entropy beyond that of clausius and boltzmann are valid.
the following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:
in boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. consistent with the boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.
entropy has often been loosely associated with the amount of order or disorder, or of chaos, in a thermodynamic system. the traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of "molecular disorder" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another. in this direction, several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies. one of the simpler entropy order/disorder formulas is that derived in 1984 by thermodynamic physicist peter landsberg, based on a combination of thermodynamics and information theory arguments. he argues that when constraints operate on a system, such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states, as contrasted with its forbidden states, the measure of the total amount of "disorder" in the system is given by:
similarly, the total amount of "order" in the system is given by:
in which "c" is the "disorder" capacity of the system, which is the entropy of the parts contained in the permitted ensemble, "c" is the "information" capacity of the system, an expression similar to shannon's channel capacity, and "c" is the "order" capacity of the system.
the concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature. similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics, and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory, entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or "spreading" of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels.
ambiguities in the terms "disorder" and "chaos", which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students. as the second law of thermodynamics shows, in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. a recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section). physical chemist peter atkins, for example, who previously wrote of dispersal leading to a disordered state, now writes that "spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy".
following on from the above, it is possible (in a thermal context) to regard lower entropy as an indicator or measure of the "effectiveness" or "usefulness" of a particular quantity of energy. this is because energy supplied at a high temperature (i.e. with low entropy) tends to be more useful than the same amount of energy available at a lower temperature. mixing a hot parcel of a fluid with a cold one produces a parcel of intermediate temperature, in which the overall increase in entropy represents a "loss" which can never be replaced.
thus, the fact that the entropy of the universe is steadily increasing, means that its total energy is becoming less useful: eventually, this will lead to the "heat death of the universe".
a definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by e.h.lieb and j. yngvason in 1999. this approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of constantin carathéodory from 1909 and the monograph by r. giles. in the setting of lieb and yngvason one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states formula_50 and formula_51 such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. defining the entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state formula_52 is defined as the largest number formula_53 such that formula_52 is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount formula_53 in the state formula_51 and a complementary amount, formula_57, in the state formula_50. a simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: it is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.
in quantum statistical mechanics, the concept of entropy was developed by john von neumann and is generally referred to as "von neumann entropy",
where ρ is the density matrix and tr is the trace operator.
this upholds the correspondence principle, because in the classical limit, when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,
i.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.
von neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work "mathematische grundlagen der quantenmechanik". he provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von neumann or projective measurement). using this concept, in conjunction with the density matrix he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.
when viewed in terms of information theory, the entropy state function is simply the amount of information (in the shannon sense) that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system. this is left unspecified by the macroscopic description.
in information theory, "entropy" is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as "shannon entropy". shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as thermodynamics. it was originally devised by claude shannon in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. the definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities "p so that
in the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. for the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.
the question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic. while most authors argue that there is a link between the two, a few argue that they have nothing to do with each other.
the expressions for the two entropies are similar. if "w" is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same "a priori" probability, then that probability is . the shannon entropy (in nats) is:
and if entropy is measured in units of "k" per nat, then the entropy is given by:
which is the famous boltzmann entropy formula when "k" is boltzmann's constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat. there are many ways of demonstrating the equivalence of "information entropy" and "physics entropy", that is, the equivalence of "shannon entropy" and "boltzmann entropy". nevertheless, some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the "h" function of information theory and using shannon's other term "uncertainty" instead.
entropy of a substance can be measured, although in an indirect way. the measurement uses the "definition of temperature" in terms of entropy, while limiting energy exchange to heat (formula_64).
the resulting relation describes how entropy changes formula_66 when a small amount of energy formula_67 is introduced into the system at a certain temperature formula_41.
the process of measurement goes as follows. first, a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible. at such temperatures, the entropy approaches zero—due to the definition of temperature. then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25°c). the obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. this value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.
although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including information theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics/ecological economics, and evolution.
for instance, an entropic argument has been recently proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders in choosing a suitable area for laying their eggs.
entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time. as time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.
entropy has been proven useful in the analysis of dna sequences. many entropy-based measures have been shown to distinguish between different structural regions of the genome, differentiate between coding and non-coding regions of dna and can also be applied for the recreation of evolutionary trees by determining the evolutionary distance between different species.
since a finite universe is an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing. it has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.
if the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then – as roger penrose has pointed out – gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon. jacob bekenstein and stephen hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. this makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. however, the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity (see hawking radiation).
the role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of ludwig boltzmann. recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer. this results in an "entropy gap" pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium. other complicating factors, such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects, are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models, making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.
current theories suggest the entropy gap to have been originally opened up by the early rapid exponential expansion of the universe.
romanian american economist nicholas georgescu-roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on "the entropy law and the economic process". due to georgescu-roegen's work, the laws of thermodynamics now form an integral part of the ecological economics school. although his work was blemished somewhat by mistakes, a full chapter on the economics of georgescu-roegen has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics.
in economics, georgescu-roegen's work has generated the term 'entropy pessimism'. since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly — a student of georgescu-roegen — has been the economics profession's most influential proponent of the entropy pessimism position.
in hermeneutics, arianna béatrice fabbricatore has used the term entropy relying on the works of umberto eco, to identify and assess the loss of meaning between the verbal description of dance and the choreotext (the moving silk engaged by the dancer when he puts into action the choreographic writing) generated by inter-semiotic translation operations..
this use is linked to the notions of logotext and choreotext. in the transition from logotext to choreotext it is possible to identify two typologies of entropy: the first, called "natural", is related to the uniqueness of the performative act and its ephemeral character. the second is caused by "voids" more or less important in the logotext ("i.e." the verbal text that reflects the action danced ).

an expert is someone who has a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in a particular field. informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. an expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. an expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (sophos). the individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.
in specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic qualification for them to be accepted as an expert. in this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. another example from computer science is that an expert system may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. in law, an expert witness must be recognized by argument and authority.
research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. the fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.
expertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. in many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert medical specialists are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.
the word expertise is used to refer also to expert determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. the decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.
there are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. the first understands expertise as an emergent property of communities of practice. in this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.
in the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. in many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience deliberate practice are common. recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the nature and nurture argument. some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.
in the field of education there is a potential "expert blind spot" (see also dunning–kruger effect) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. this is based on the "expert blind spot hypothesis" researched by mitchell nathan and andrew petrosino (2003: 906). newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.
the blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. this expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices’ cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts’ and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (borko & livingston, 1989: 474). essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (borko, eisenhart, brown, underhill, jones, & agard, 1992: 195). pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. the expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators’ experience with instructing learners over time.
in line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of power; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. by a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. in earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. the introduction of the printing press in europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. the subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.
plato's "noble lie", concerns expertise. plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, plato said, must tell the people of the city "the noble lie" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.
in contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman. however, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries , despite not understanding it.
a number of computational models have been developed in cognitive science to explain the development from novice to expert. in particular, herbert a. simon and kevin gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called mapp (memory-aided pattern recognizer). based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 chunks (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. more recently, the chrest model (chunk hierarchy and retrieval structures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.
an important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. they recognize situations because they have meaning. it is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. work on "skilled memory and expertise" by anders ericsson and james j. staszewski confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.
work on expert systems (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. however, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. they are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.
in a critique of the expert systems literature suggest:
the role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by chase and simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. they asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. this research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.
skilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. for example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. when unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.
the first principle of skilled memory, the "meaningful encoding principle," states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. the elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.
the second principle, the "retrieval structure principle" states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. these mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.
the third principle, the "speed up principle" states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.
examples of skilled memory research described within the ericsson and stasewski study include:
much of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems (chi, m. t. h., glasser r., & rees, e.,1982). mathematics (sweller, j., mawer, r. f., & ward, m. r., 1983) and physics (chi, feltovich, & glaser, 1981) are common domains for these studies.
one of the most cited works in this area, chi et al. (1981), examines how experts (phd students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. they found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).
their findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts’ schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices’ schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.
relative to a specific field, an expert has:
marie-line germain (germain, 2006) developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the generalized expertise measure (gem). she defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by swanson and holton (2001). her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. objective items were named evidence-based items. subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named self-enhancement items because of their behavioral component.
(condensed from germain, 2006).
scholars in rhetoric have also turned their attention to the concept of the expert. considered an appeal to ethos or "the personal character of the speaker", established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. in other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience’s judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.
in the rhetoric of expertise, e. johanna hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. while an autonomous expert can "possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people," attributed expertise is "a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge." with these two categories, hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. the problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?
hartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. in "wikipedia and the emergence of dialogic expertise", she highlights wikipedia as an example of the "dialogic expertise" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. predicated upon the notion that "truth emerges from dialogue", wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. in other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. the production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.
hartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: “network norms of dialogic collaboration” and “deferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism”; wikipedia being evidence of the first. drawing on a bakhtinian framework, hartelius posits that wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals’ ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively. hartelius compares wikipedia’s methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of bakhtin’s theory of speech communication, where genuine dialogue is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants. hartelius acknowledges that knowledge, experience, training, skill, and qualification are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest. arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, hartelius explains that expertise: “(...) is not simply about one person’s skills being different from another’s. it is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.”. effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary. hartelius further suggests that wikipedia’s dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges traditional encyclopedias and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production. going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. wikipedia’s use of hyperlinks to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that wikipedia’s way of knowing is dialogic. dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the discourse community. the ongoing dialogue between contributors on wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. as hartelius explains: “the very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.”. while wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue. according to hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site’s hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias. by wikipedia’s hortative discourse, hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site. one further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on wikipedia is the site’s , which function as a techne; explicating wikipedia’s expert methodology.
building on hartelius, damien pfister developed the concept of "networked expertise". noting that wikipedia employs a "many to many" rather than a "one to one" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. with the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. as he puts it, "with the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the web means that what and how to information is readily available." the rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.
an expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to "be able to solve" a problem and an expert has to "know its solution". the opposite of an expert is generally known as a layperson, while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a technician and often employed to assist experts. a person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. the concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of epistemology under the general heading of expert knowledge. in contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a generalist or polymath.
the term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no objective criteria for their expertise is available. the term crank is likewise used to disparage opinions. academic elitism arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.
in contrast to an expert, a novice (known colloquially as a newbie or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.
"expert" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term "authority" in new media. an expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. however, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. in new media, users are being misled by the term "authority". many sites and search engines such as google and technorati use the term "authority" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. however, this authority only measures populist information. it in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.
some characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include
mark twain defined an expert as "an ordinary fellow from another town". will rogers described an expert as "a man fifty miles from home with a briefcase." danish scientist and nobel laureate niels bohr defined an expert as "a person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field."
malcolm gladwell describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours.

the economy of afghanistan has had significant improvement in the last decade due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and remittances from afghan expatriates. the assistance that came from expatriates and outside investors saw this increase when there was more political reliability after the fall of the taliban regime. the nation's gdp stands at about $70 billion with an exchange rate of $20 billion (2017), and the gdp per capita is about $2,000. it imports over $6 billion worth of goods but exports nearly $1 billion only, mainly fruits and nuts.
despite holding over $1 trillion in proven untapped mineral deposits, afghanistan remains one of the least developed countries on the planet. about 25% of its population is unemployed and lives below the poverty line. many of the unemployed men join the foreign-funded militant groups or the world of crime, particularly as smugglers. the afghan government has long been pleading for foreign investment in order to improve afghanistan's economy.
ancient afghanistan was one of the most prosperous countries in the world owing to its vibrant trade with greater india that extended till bangladesh and beyond.
in the early modern period under the rule of kings abdur rahman khan (1880–1901) and habibullah khan (1901–1919), a great deal of afghan commerce was centrally controlled by the afghan government. the afghan monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. this slowed the long-term development of afghanistan during that period. western technologies and manufacturing methods were slowly introduced during these eras at the command of the afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of the growing army. an emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and other military material. this process was in the hands of a small number of western experts invited to kabul by the afghan kings. otherwise, it was not possible for outsiders, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale enterprises in afghanistan during that period.
the first prominent plan to develop afghanistan's economy in modern times was the helmand valley authority project, modeled on the tennessee valley authority in the united states, which was expected to be of primary economic importance. the country began facing severe economic hardships during the 1970s when neighboring pakistan, under zulfikar ali bhutto, began closing the pakistan-afghanistan border crossings. this move resulted in afghanistan increasing political and economic ties with its northern neighbor, the powerful soviet union of that time.
the 1979 soviet invasion and ensuing civil war destroyed much of the country's limited infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity. eventually, afghanistan went from a traditional economy to a centrally planned economy up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy. gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. continuing internal strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide ways for the international community to help.
according to the international monetary fund, the afghan economy grew 20% in the fiscal year ending in march 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. the growth is attributed to international aid and to the end of droughts. an estimated $100 billion of aid entered the nation from 2002 to 2017. a gdp of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the imf to $6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from opium products. mean graduate pay was $0.56 per man-hour in 2010.
afghanistan currently produces roughly 1.5 million tons of fresh fruits annually, which could be increased significantly. it is known for producing some of the finest fruits, especially apples, apricots, cherries, figs, grapes, melons, sweet mulberries, peaches, and pomegranates. building and using greenhouses is a fast-growing industry in the country.
the northern afghan provinces are famous for pistachio cultivation. in recent years, farmers in the southern and western provinces have also began cultivating pistachios. provinces in the east of the country are famous for pine nuts. the northern and central provinces are also famous for almonds and walnuts. the bamyan province in central afghanistan is known for growing superior potatoes, which on an average produces 140,000 to 170,000 tonnes. nangarhar province is known for oranges, olives, peanuts, and dates. cultivation of these fruits are now spreading to other provinces in the south of the country.
wheat and cereal production is afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. national wheat production in 2015 was 5 million tons. afghanistan is nearing self-sufficiency in grain production. it requires an additional 1 million ton of wheat to become self-sufficient, which is predicted to be accomplished in 2020. the overall agricultural production sometimes declines following droughts.
livestock in afghanistan mainly include cattle, sheep, and goats. building and using modern poultry farms is also a fast-growing industry. the availability of land suitable for grazing has traditionally made animal husbandry an important part of the economy. there are two main types of animal husbandry: sedentary, practiced by farmers who raise both animals and crops; and nomadic, practiced by animal herders known as kuchis. natural pastures cover some but are being overgrazed. the northern regions around mazar-i-sharif and maymana were the home range for about six million karakul sheep in the late 1990s. most flocks move to the highlands in the summer to pastures in the north.
arable land in afghanistan is around 8 million hectares. wheat production stands at about 5 million tonnes, nurseries hold 119,000 hectares of land, and grape production is at 615,000 tonnes. almond production has jumped to 56,000 tonnes and cotton to 45,000 tonnes. it was reported in 2019 that about 10,000 acres of land in afghanistan is used to cultivate saffron.
according to the world bank’s report published in april 2019, afghanistan’s economy suffered from the consequences of a severe drought that affected the agriculture production in 2018. while the wheat production declined by 24%, milk production declined by 30%.
the country has plenty of reservoirs, rivers and streams, which make it a suitable climate for fish farming. fishing takes place in the lakes and rivers, particularly in nangarhar province and in the helmand river in southern afghanistan. fish constitute a smaller part of the afghan diet today because fish farmers are unable to produce enough fish to keep up with the demands of customers. most fish and seafood are imported from neighboring pakistan, iran, and the united arab emirates. there are hundreds of fish farms throughout the country and the largest one is at the qargha, which supplies fish eggs to the other fish farms. fish farming has also been launched in the salma dam.
afghanistan's timber has been greatly depleted, and since the mid-1980s, only about 3% of the land area has been forested, mainly in the east. significant stands of trees have been destroyed by the ravages of the war in the late 20th century. exploitation has been hampered by insecurity and access roads. moreover, the distribution of the forest is uneven, and most of the remaining woodland is only found in the kunar, nuristan and the paktia regions in the east of the country. some steps have been taken in recent years in planting trees across afghanistan. even the taliban leaders have recently called for planting more trees.
the natural forests in afghanistan are mainly of two types: dense forests of oak trees, walnut trees, and many other species of nuts that grow in the southeast, and on the northern and northeastern slopes of the sulaiman ranges; and sparsely distributed short trees and shrubs on all other slopes of the hindu kush. the dense forests of the southeast cover only 2.7% of the country. roundwood production in 2003 was 3,148,000 cubic metres, with 44% used for fuel.
the destruction of the forests to create agricultural land, logging, forest fires, plant diseases, and insect pests are all causes of the reduction in forest coverage. illegal logging and clear-cutting by timber smugglers have exacerbated this destructive process. there is currently a ban on cutting new timber in afghanistan. prior to 2001 and under taliban rule, massive deforestation of the country side was permitted and afghans moved large quantities of logs into storage centers for profit, where the trees wait for processing on an individual tree by tree request.
afghanistan's trade with other countries is steadily increasing. afghan handwoven rugs are one of the most popular products for exportation. other products include hand crafted antique replicas as well as leather and furs. afghanistan is the third largest exporter of cashmere.
afghanistan is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, including extensive deposits of natural gas, petroleum, coal, marble, gold, copper, chromite, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, precious and semi-precious stones, and many rare earth elements. in 2006, a u.s. geological survey estimated that afghanistan has as much as of natural gas, of oil and condensate reserves. according to a 2007 assessment, afghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral resources. geologists also found indications of abundant deposits of colored stones and gemstones, including emerald, ruby, sapphire, garnet, lapis, kunzite, spinel, tourmaline and peridot.
in 2010, u.s. pentagon officials along with american geologists have revealed the discovery of nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in afghanistan. a memo from the pentagon stated that afghanistan could become the "saudi arabia of lithium". some believe, including former afghan president hamid karzai, that the untapped minerals are worth up to $3 trillion.
another us geological survey estimate from september 2011 showed that the khanashin carbonatites in the helmand province of the country have an estimated 1 million metric tonnes of rare earth elements. regina dubey, acting director for the department of defence "task force for business and stability operations (tfbso)" stated that "this is just one more piece of evidence that afghanistan's mineral sector has a bright future."
afghanistan signed a copper deal with china (metallurgical corp. of china ltd.) in 2008, which is to a large-scale project that involves the investment of $2.8 billion by china and an annual income of about $400 million to the afghan government. the country's ainak copper mine, located in logar province, is one of the biggest in the world and is expected to provide jobs to 20,000 afghans. it is estimated to hold at least 11 million tonnes or us$33 billion worth of copper.
experts believe that the production of copper could begin within two to three years and the iron ore in five to seven years as of 2010. the country's other recently announced treasure is the hajigak iron ore mine, located 130 miles west of kabul and is believed to hold an estimated 1.8 billion to 2 billion metric tons of the mineral used to make steel. afisco, an indian consortium of seven companies, led by the steel authority of india limited (sail), and canada's kilo goldmines ltd are expected to jointly invest $14.6 billion in developing the hajigak iron mine. the country has several coal mines but need to be modernized.
afghanistan's important resource in the past has been natural gas, which was first tapped in 1967. during the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a year in export revenues (56% of the total). 90% of these exports went to the soviet union to pay for imports and debts. however, during the withdrawal of soviet troops in 1989, afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage by the mujahideen. gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2 million cubic metres per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 cubic meters in 2001. after the formation of the karzai administration, production of natural gas was once again restored.
a locally owned company, azizi hotak general trading group, is currently the main supplier of diesel fuel, gasoline, jet fuel and lpg in afghanistan. in december 2011, afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with china national petroleum corporation (cnpc) for the development of three oil fields along the amu darya river. the state will have its first oil refineries within the next three years, after which it will receive very little of the profits from the sale of the oil and natural gas. cnpc began afghan oil production in late october 2012, with extracting 1.5 million barrels of oil annually.
trade in goods smuggled into pakistan once constituted a major source of revenue for afghanistan. many of the goods that were smuggled into pakistan have originally entered afghanistan from pakistan, where they fell under the 1965 afghanistan–pakistan transit trade agreement. this permitted goods bound for afghanistan to transit through pakistani seaports free of duty. once in afghanistan, the goods were often immediately smuggled back into pakistan over the porous border that the two countries share, often with the help of corrupt officials. additionally, items declared as afghanistan-bound were often prematurely offloaded from trucks and smuggled into pakistani markets without paying requisite duty fees. this resulted in the creation of a thriving black market, with much of the illegal trading occurring openly, as was common in peshawar's bustling karkhano market, which was widely regarded as a smuggler's bazaar.
in 2010, afghanistan and pakistan signed into law a new afghanistan–pakistan transit trade agreement (aptta), which allows their shipping trucks to transit goods within both nations. this revised us-sponsored aptta agreement also allows afghan trucks to transport exports to india via pakistan up to the wagah crossing point. afghanistan's main land ports are shir khan bandar, hairatan, islam qala, towraghondi, torkham, wesh–chaman, and zaranj.
afghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s. the government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent students abroad for education. in 1952 it created the helmand valley authority to manage the economic development of the helmand and arghandab valleys through irrigation and land development, a scheme which remains one of the country's most important capital resources.
in 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious development plans. by the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.
da afghanistan bank serves as the central bank of the nation. the "afghani" (afn) is the national currency, which has an exchange rate of nearly 70 afghanis to 1 us dollar. there are over 16 different banks operating in the country, including afghanistan international bank, kabul bank, azizi bank, pashtany bank, standard chartered bank, and first micro finance bank. cash is still widely used for most transactions. a new law on private investment provides three to seven-year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports tariffs and duties. according to a un report in 2007, afghanistan has received over $3.3 billion from its expatriate community in 2006. un officials familiar with the issue said remittances to afghanistan could have been more if the banking regulations are more convenient. additionally, improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.
afghanistan is a member of world trade organization, saarc, eco, oic, and has an observer status in the sco. it seeks to complete the so-called "new silk road" trade project, which is aimed to connecting south asia with central asia and the middle east. this way afghanistan will be able to collect large fees from trade passing through the country, including from the trans-afghanistan pipeline. foreign minister zalmai rassoul has stated that the "goal is to achieve an afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment". experts believe that this will revolutionize the economy of the region.
as part of an attempt to modernize the city and boost the economy, a number of new high rise buildings are under construction by various developers. some of the national development projects include the new kabul city next to the capital, the aino mena in kandahar, and the ghazi amanullah khan city east of jalalabad. similar development projects are also found in herat in the west, mazar-e-sharif in the north and in other cities.
as a competitor of the coca-cola company, the pepsi-cola company is said to be establishing itself in afghanistan. this not only promotes foreign investment but also makes the country less dependent on imports from neighboring countries and helps provide employment opportunity to many afghans. watan group is a company based in afghanistan that provides telecommunications, logistics and security services.
in february 2019, it was reported that the world bank granted $235 million to the government of afghanistan for the country's development and growth. the acting minister of finance humayon qayoumi said that out of the total amount granted, $75 million will finance "the tackling afghanistan's government hrm (human resource management) and institutional reforms (taghir) project, which will strengthen the capacity of selected line ministries. the grant also includes 25 million u.s. dollars from ida (international development association) and 50 million u.s. dollars from artf (afghanistan reconstruction trust fund)."
afghanistan’s economy grew by only 1% in 2018, which has been the slowest growth rate since 2001, the world bank 2019 report stated. however, the economy is expected to recover by 2.5% in 2019.
tourism in afghanistan was at its peak in 1977. many tourists from around the world came to visit afghanistan, including from as far away as europe and north america. all of that ended with the start of the april 1978 saur revolution. however, it is again gradually increasing despite the insecurity. each year about 20,000 foreign tourists visit afghanistan. tourists should avoid areas where armed criminals operate in the name of taliban. as a policy, the taliban are known not to harm tourists. distinguishing the two groups is very difficult.
the country has four international airports, including the hamid karzai international airport, mazar-e sharif international airport, kandahar international airport and herat international airport. it also has several smaller airports throughout the country. the city of kabul has many guest houses and hotels, including the serena hotel, the hotel inter-continental kabul, and the safi landmark hotel. guest houses and hotels can also be found in the other cities, including in bamyan.

an elf (plural: "elves") is a type of human-shaped supernatural being in germanic mythology and folklore. in medieval germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. however, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-christian and christian cultures.
the word "elf" is found throughout the germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'. reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by christians, in old and middle english, medieval german, and old norse. these associate elves variously with the gods of norse mythology, with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction.
after the medieval period, the word "elf" tended to become less common throughout the germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like "zwerc" ("dwarf") in german and "huldra" ("hidden being") in scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like "fairy" (borrowed from french into most of the germanic languages). still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in scotland and scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. they continued to be associated with causing illness and with sexual threats. for example, a number of early modern ballads in the british isles and scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters.
with urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). however, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. these literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with william shakespeare's "a midsummer night's dream" being a key development of this idea. in the eighteenth century, german romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the english word "elf" into the german language.
from this romanticist elite culture came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. the "christmas elves" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the united states. elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as j. r. r. tolkien; these re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and human-like beings. elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games nowadays.
from a scientific viewpoint, elves are not considered objectively real.
however, elves have in many times and places been believed to be real beings. where enough people have believed in the reality of elves that those beliefs then had real effects in the world, they can be understood as part of people's world view, and as a social reality: a thing which, like the exchange-value of a dollar bill or the sense of pride stirred up by a national flag, is real because of people's beliefs rather than as an objective reality. accordingly, beliefs about elves and their social functions have varied over time and space.
even in the twenty-first century, fantasy stories about elves have been argued both to reflect and shape their audiences' understanding of the real world, and traditions about santa claus and his elves relate to christmas.
over time, people have attempted to demythologise or rationalise beliefs in elves in various ways.
beliefs about elves have their origins before the conversion to christianity and associated christianization of north-west europe. for this reason, belief in elves has, from the middle ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled "pagan" and a "superstition". however, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by christians (whether anglo-saxon monks, medieval icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of germanic-speakers' christian culture and not merely relic of their pre-christian religion. accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and christian cosmology has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.
historically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into christian cosmology, all of which are found widely across time and space:
some nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars attempted to rationalise beliefs in elves as folk-memories of lost indigenous peoples. since belief in supernatural beings is so ubiquitous in human cultures, however, scholars no longer believe that such explanations are valid. research has shown, however, that stories about elves have often been used as a way for people to think metaphorically about real-life ethnic others.
scholars have at times also tried to explain away beliefs in elves as being inspired by people suffering certain kinds of illness (such as williams syndrome). elves were certainly often seen as a cause of illness, and indeed the english word "oaf" seems to have originated as a form of the "elf": the word "elf" came to mean 'changeling left by an elf' and then, because changelings were noted for their failure to thrive, to its modern sense 'a fool, a stupid person; a large, clumsy man or boy'. however, it again seems unlikely that the origin of beliefs in elves itself is to be explained by people's encounters with objectively real people affected by disease.
the english word "elf" is from the old english word most often attested as "ælf" (whose plural would have been *"ælfe"). although this word took a variety of forms in different old english dialects, these converged on the form "elf" during the middle english period. during the old english period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as "ælfen", putatively from common germanic *"ɑlβ(i)innjō"), but during the middle english period the word "elf" came routinely to include female beings.
the main medieval germanic cognates are old norse "alfr", plural "alfar", and old high german "alp", plural "alpî", "elpî" (alongside the feminine "elbe"). these words must come from common germanic, the ancestor-language of english, german, and the scandinavian languages: the common germanic forms must have been *"ɑlβi-z" and "ɑlβɑ-z".
germanic "*ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z" is generally agreed to be cognate with the latin "albus" ('(matt) white'), old irish "ailbhín" ('flock'); albanian "elb" ('barley'); and germanic words for 'swan' such as modern icelandic "álpt". these all come from an indo-european base "*alb-", and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. the germanic word presumably originally meant "white one", perhaps as a euphemism. jakob grimm thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting snorri sturluson's "ljósálfar", suggested that elves were divinities of light. this is not necessarily the case, however. for example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, alaric hall has suggested that elves may have been called "the white people" because whiteness was associated with (specifically feminine) beauty.
a completely different etymology, making "elf" cognate with the "rbhus", semi-divine craftsmen in indian mythology, was also suggested by kuhn, in 1855. in this case, *"ɑlβi-z" connotes the meaning, "skillful, inventive, clever", and is cognate with latin "labor", in the sense of "creative work". while often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.
throughout the medieval germanic languages, "elf" was one of the nouns that was used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. these names may have been influenced by celtic names beginning in "albio-" such as "albiorix".
personal names provide the only evidence for "elf" in gothic, which must have had the word *"albs" (plural *"albeis"). the most famous name of this kind is "alboin". old english names in "elf"- include the cognate of "alboin" ælfwine (literally "elf-friend", m.), ælfric ("elf-powerful", m.), ælfweard ("elf-guardian", m.), and ælfwaru ("elf-care", f.). a widespread survivor of these in modern english is alfred (old english "ælfrēd", "elf-advice"). also surviving are the english surname elgar ("ælfgar", "elf-spear") and the name of st alphege ("ælfhēah", "elf-high"). german examples are "alberich", "alphart" and "alphere" (father of walter of aquitaine) and icelandic examples include "álfhildur". these names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early germanic culture. of the many words for supernatural beings in germanic languages, the only ones regularly used in personal names are "elf" and words denoting pagan gods, suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods.
in later old icelandic, "alfr" ("elf") and the personal name which in common germanic had been *"aþa(l)wulfaz" both coincidentally became "álfr~álfr".
elves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to "elf". the clearest english example is "elveden" ("elves' hill", suffolk); other examples may be "eldon hill" ("elves' hill", derbyshire); and "alden valley" ("elves' valley", lancashire). these seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.
the earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any germanic language are from anglo-saxon england. medieval english evidence has, therefore, attracted quite extensive research and debate. in old english, elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and livestock with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. the most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm "wið færstice" ("against a stabbing pain"), from the tenth-century compilation "lacnunga", but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century "bald's leechbook" and "leechbook iii". this tradition continues into later english-language traditions too: elves continue to appear in middle english medical texts.
beliefs in elves causing illness remained prominent in early modern scotland, where elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people. thus, elves were often mentioned in the early modern scottish witchcraft trials: many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves. throughout these sources, elves are sometimes associated with the succuba-like supernatural being called the "mare".
while they may have been thought to cause disease with magical weapons, elves are more clearly associated in old english with a kind of magic denoted by old english "sīden" and "sīdsa", cognate with old norse "seiðr", and also paralleled in the old irish "serglige con culainn". by the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy.
in one or two old english medical texts, elves might be envisaged as inflicting illness with projectiles. in the twentieth century, scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as "elf-shot", but work from the 1990s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves being thought to cause illness in this way is slender; debate about its significance is ongoing.
the noun "elf-shot" is actually first attested in a scots poem, "rowlis cursing", from around 1500, where "elf schot" is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken-thieves. the term may not always have denoted an actual projectile: "shot" could mean "a sharp pain" as well as "projectile". but in early modern scotland "elf-schot" and other terms like "elf-arrowhead" are sometimes used of neolithic arrow-heads, apparently thought to have been made by elves. in a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrrow-heads were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged that witches (and perhaps elves) used them to injure people and cattle. compare with the following excerpt from a 1749–50 ode by william collins:
because of elves' association with illness, in the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the anglo-saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. this was encouraged by the idea that "elf-shot" is depicted in the eadwine psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection. however, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of god's arrows and of christian demons. rather, recent scholarship suggests anglo-saxon elves, like elves in scandinavia or the irish "aos sí", were regarded as people.
like words for gods and men, the word "elf" is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not. just as "álfar" are associated with "æsir" in old norse, the old english "wið færstice" associates elves with "ēse"; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods. in old english, the plural "ylfe" (attested in "beowulf") is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people. as well as appearing in medical texts, the old english word "ælf" and its feminine derivative "ælbinne" were used in glosses to translate latin words for nymphs. this fits well with the word "ælfscȳne", which meant "elf-beautiful" and is attested describing the seductively beautiful biblical heroines sarah and judith.
likewise, in middle english and early modern scottish evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. they became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly with the idea of a fairy queen. a propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.
by the end of the medieval period, "elf" was increasingly being supplanted by the french loan-word "fairy". an example is geoffrey chaucer's satirical tale "sir thopas", where the title character sets out in quest of the "elf-queen", who dwells in the "countree of the faerie".
evidence for elf-beliefs in medieval scandinavia outside iceland is very sparse, but the icelandic evidence is uniquely rich. for a long time, views about elves in old norse mythology were defined by snorri sturluson's "prose edda", which talks about "svartálfar", "dökkálfar" and "ljósálfar" ("black elves", "dark elves", and "light elves"). however, these words are only attested in the prose edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves, demons, and angels, partly showing snorri's "paganisation" of a christian cosmology learned from the "elucidarius", a popular digest of christian thought.
scholars of old norse mythology now focus on references to elves in old norse poetry, particularly the elder edda. the only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical eddaic poetry, if any, is völundr, the protagonist of "völundarkviða". however, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase "æsir ok álfar" ('æsir and elves') and its variants. this was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and æsir were one and the same. the pairing is paralleled in the old english poem "wið færstice" and in the germanic personal name system; moreover, in skaldic verse the word "elf" is used in the same way as words for gods. sigvatr þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue "austrfaravísur", composed around 1020, mentions an "álfablót" (‘elves' sacrifice’) in edskogen in what is now southern sweden. there does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants. many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in old norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval german evidence.
there are hints that the god freyr was associated with elves. in particular, "álfheimr" (literally "elf-world") is mentioned as being given to freyr in "grímnismál". snorri sturluson identified freyr as one of the vanir. however, the term "vanir" is rare in eddaic verse, very rare in skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other germanic languages. given the link between freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that "álfar" and "vanir" are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings. however, this is not uniformly accepted.
a kenning (poetic metaphor) for the sun, "álfröðull" (literally "elf disc"), is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun.
although the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that völundr is described as one of the elves in "völundarkviða". as his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. the same idea is present in two post-classical eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or breton "lais", "kötludraumur" and "gullkársljóð". the idea also occurs in later traditions in scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the bergen rune-charm from among the bryggen inscriptions.
the appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre. the sagas of icelanders, bishops' sagas, and contemporary sagas, whose portrayal of the supernatural is generally restrained, rarely mention "álfar", and then only in passing. but although limited, these texts provide some of the best evidence for the presence of elves in everyday beliefs in medieval scandinavia. they include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in 1168 (in "sturlunga saga"); mention of an "álfablót" ("elves' sacrifice") in "kormáks saga"; and the existence of the euphemism "ganga álfrek" ('go to drive away the elves') for "going to the toilet" in "eyrbyggja saga".
the kings' sagas include a rather elliptical but widely studied account of an early swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called ólafr geirstaðaálfr ('ólafr the elf of geirstaðir'), and a demonic elf at the beginning of "norna-gests þáttr".
the legendary sagas tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. mention of the land of álfheimr is found in "heimskringla" while "þorsteins saga víkingssonar" recounts a line of local kings who ruled over álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men. according to "hrólfs saga kraka", hrolfr kraki's half-sister skuld was the half-elven child of king helgi and an elf-woman ("álfkona"). skuld was skilled in witchcraft ("seiðr"). accounts of skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. the "þiðreks saga" version of the nibelungen (niflungar) describes högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the eddas, "völsunga saga", or the "nibelungenlied". the relatively few mentions of elves in the chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.
both continental scandinavia and iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts, sometimes in latin and sometimes in the form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. most of them have low german connections.
the old high german word "alp" is attested only in a small number of glosses. it is defined by the "althochdeutsches wörterbuch" as a "nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the fauns of classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... as the mare he messes around with women". accordingly, the german word "alpdruck" (literally "elf-oppression") means "nightmare". there is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.
in a similar vein, elves are in middle german most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people "in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: "die elben/der alp trieget mich" ("the elves/elf are/is deceiving me"). the same pattern holds in early modern german. this deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in english and scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth-century heinrich von morungen's fifth "minnesang" begins "von den elben wirt entsehen vil manic man / sô bin ich von grôzer liebe entsên" ("full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus i too am bewitched by great love"). "elbe" was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.
in later medieval prayers, elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. for example, there are prayers which invoke god's help against noctural attacks by "alpe". correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north germany doing the evil bidding of witches; martin luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.
as in old norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. it seems likely that in the german-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves (). thus, some dwarves that appear in german heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves. in particular, nineteenth-century scholars tended to think that the dwarf alberich, whose name etymologically means "elf-powerful", was influenced by early traditions of elves.
from around the late middle ages, the word "elf" began to be used in english as a term loosely synonymous with the french loan-word "fairy"; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like puck, hobgoblins, robin goodfellow, the english and scots brownie, and the northumbrian english hob.
however, in scotland and parts of northern england near the scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. james vi of scotland and robert kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of issobel gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales, there is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as "thomas the rhymer", where a man meets a female elf; "tam lin", "the elfin knight", and "lady isabel and the elf-knight", in which an elf-knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and "the queen of elfland's nourice", a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.
in scandinavian folklore, a diverse array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might be thought of as elves and which might partly originate in medieval scandinavian beliefs. however, the characteristics and names of these beings have varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. these beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from old norse "álfr". however, in the modern languages, traditional terms related to "álfr" have tended to be replaced with other terms. things are further complicated by the fact that when referring to the elves of old norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the old norse word "álfr". the following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of scandinavia.
the elves of norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones. the swedish "älvor" were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king.
the elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. they left a circle where they had danced, which were called "älvdanser" (elf dances) or "älvringar" (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle. in the words of the local historian anne marie hellström:
if a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older scandinavian ballads.
elves were not exclusively young and beautiful. in the swedish folktale "little rosa and long leda", an elvish woman ("älvakvinna") arrives in the end and saves the heroine, little rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. she is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the "subterraneans".
elves have a prominent place in a number of closely related ballads which must have originated in the middle ages but are first attested in the early modern period. many of these ballads are first attested in karen brahes folio, a danish manuscript from the 1570s, but they circulated widely in scandinavia and northern britain. because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves, even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage. they have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. they therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture.
the ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and human(-like) beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). the elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people into the elves' world. much the most popular example is "elveskud" and its many variants (paralleled in english as "clerk colvill"), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. as in "elveskud", sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in "elvehøj" (much the same story as "elveskud," but with a happy ending), "herr magnus og bjærgtrolden", "herr tønne af alsø", "herr bøsmer i elvehjem", or the northern british "thomas the rhymer". sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern british "tam lin", "the elfin knight", and "lady isabel and the elf-knight", in which the elf-knight bears away isabel to murder her, or the scandinavian "harpans kraft". in "the queen of elfland's nourice", a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.
in folk-stories, scandinavian elves often play the role of disease-spirits. the most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called "älvablåst" (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). "skålgropar", a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in scandinavia, were known in older times as "älvkvarnar" (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. one could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.
in order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, scandinavians could use a so-called elf cross ("alfkors", "älvkors" or "ellakors"), which was carved into buildings or other objects. it existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves. the second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. this second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. in some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive sundays.
in iceland, expression of belief in the "huldufólk" ("hidden people"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. even when icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief. a 2006 and 2007 study by the university of iceland's faculty of social sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts, a result similar to a 1974 survey by erlendur haraldsson. the lead researcher of the 2006–2007 study, terry gunnell, stated: "icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations". whether significant numbers of icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. they occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. in the analysis of valdimar tr. hafstein, "narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. the elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer". elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary icelandic literature.
folk-stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern denmark and sweden, but now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. in an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.
early modern europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive elite culture: while the reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. the effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in england and germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. in scandinavia, the romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word "elf, "except in fossilised words for illnesses. however, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in scandinavia into the early twentieth century.
elves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of elizabethan england. here edmund spenser's "faerie queene" (1590–) used "fairy" and "elf" interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures. spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the "elfe" and "elfin kynd", claiming that they were created by prometheus. likewise, william shakespeare, in a speech in "romeo and juliet" (1592) has an "elf-lock" (tangled hair) being caused queen mab, who is referred to as "the fairies' midwife". meanwhile, "a midsummer night's dream" promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and ethereal. the influence of shakespeare and michael drayton made the use of "elf" and "fairy" for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves, collected in the modern period.
early modern english notions of elves became influential in eighteenth-century germany. the modern german "elf" (m) and "elfe" (f) was introduced as a loan-word from english in the 1740s and was prominent in christoph martin wieland's 1764 translation of "a midsummer night's dream".
as german romanticism got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, jacob grimm rejected "elf" as a recent anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form "elb" (plural "elbe" or "elben"). in the same vein, johann gottfried herder translated the danish ballad "elveskud" in his 1778 collection of folk songs, "", as "" ("the erl-king's daughter"; it appears that herder introduced the term "erlkönig" into german through a mis-germanisation of the danish word for "elf"). this in turn inspired goethe's poem "der erlkönig". goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the romantic concept of the erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.
in scandinavia too, in the nineteenth century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. these are often called "elves" ("älvor" in modern swedish, "alfer" in danish, "álfar" in icelandic), although the more formal translation in danish is "feer". thus, the "alf" found in the fairy tale "the elf of the rose" by danish author hans christian andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has "wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet". yet andersen also wrote about "elvere" in "the elfin hill". the elves in this story are more alike those of traditional danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. like the "huldra" in norway and sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.
english and german literary traditions both influenced the british victorian image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. an example is andrew lang's fairy tale "princess nobody" (1884), illustrated by richard doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. these conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example enid blyton's the faraway tree series, and were influenced by german romantic literature. accordingly, in the brothers grimm fairy tale "die wichtelmänner" (literally, "the little men"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. even though "wichtelmänner" are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into english by margaret hunt in 1884 as "the elves and the shoemaker". this shows how the meanings of "elf" had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of j. k. rowling's harry potter stories. in his turn, j. r. r. tolkien recommended using the older german form "elb" in translations of his works, as recorded in his "guide to the names in the lord of the rings" (1967). "elb, elben" was consequently introduced in the 1972 german translation of "the lord of the rings", repopularising the form in german.
with industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.
as american christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem "a visit from st. nicholas" (widely known as "'twas the night before christmas") characterized st nicholas himself as "a right jolly old elf". however, it was his little helpers, inspired partly by folktales like "the elves and the shoemaker", who became known as "santa's elves"; the processes through which this came about are not well understood, but one key figure was a christmas-related publication by the german-american cartoonist thomas nast. thus in the us, canada, uk, and ireland, the modern children's folklore of santa claus typically includes small, nimble, green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats, as santa's helpers. they make the toys in a workshop located in the north pole. the role of elves as santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular christmas movie "elf".
the fantasy genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth-century romanticism, in which nineteenth-century scholars such as andrew lang and the grimm brothers collected fairy-stories from folklore and in some cases retold them freely.
a pioneering work of the fantasy genre was "the king of elfland's daughter", a 1924 novel by lord dunsany. the elves of middle-earth played a central role in tolkien's legendarium, notably "the silmarillion" and "the lord of the rings"; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. tolkien also appears to be the first author to have introduced the notion that elves are immortal beings. post-tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as "dungeons & dragons") are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. they are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. they are often skilled archers. a hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.
in works where elves are the main characters, such as "the silmarillion" or wendy and richard pini's comic book series "elfquest", elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. however, where narratives are more human-centered, as in "the lord of the rings", elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. for example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.
beliefs in human-like supernatural beings are widespread in human cultures, and many such beings may be referred to as "elves" in english.
elf-like beings appear to have been a common characteristic within indo-european mythologies. in the celtic-speaking regions of north-west europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the gaelic term "aos sí". the equivalent term in modern welsh is "tylwyth teg". in the romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from latin "fata" ('fate'), which came into english as "fairy." this word became partly synonymous with "elf" by the early modern period. other names also abound, however, such as the sicilian "donas de fuera" ('ladies from outside'), or french "bonnes dames" ('good ladies'). in the finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to "elf" is "haltija" (in finnish) or "haldaja" (estonian). meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the slavic-speaking world is the "vila" (plural "vile") of serbo-croatian (and, partly, slovene) folklore. elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.
some scholarship draws parallels between the arabian tradition of "jinn" with the elves of medieval germanic-language cultures. some of the comparisons are quite precise: for example, the root of the word "jinn" was used in medieval arabic terms for madness and possession in similar ways to the old english word "ylfig", which derived from "elf" and also denoted prophetic states of mind implicitly associated with elvish possession.
khmer culture in cambodia includes the "mrenh kongveal", elf-like beings associated with guarding animals.
in the animistic precolonial beliefs of the philippines, the world can be divided into the material world and the spirit world. all objects, animate or inanimate, has a spirit called "anito". non-human "anito" are known as "diwata", usually euphemistically referred to as "dili ingon nato" ('those unlike us'). they inhabit natural features like mountains, forests, old trees, caves, reefs, etc., as well as personify abstract concepts and natural phenomena. they are similar to elves in that they are beings that can be helpful or malevolent, but are usually indifferent to mortals. they can be mischievous and cause unintentional harm to humans, but they can also deliberately cause illnesses and misfortunes when disrespected or angered. spanish colonizers equated them with elf and fairy folklore.
orang bunian are supernatural beings in malaysian, bruneian and indonesian folklore, invisible to most humans except those with spiritual sight. while the term is often translated as "elves", it literally translates to "hidden people" or "whistling people". their appearance is nearly identical to humans dressed in ancient southeast asian style.
in māori culture, patupaiarehe are beings similar to european elves and fairies.

evil, in a general sense, is the opposite or absence of good. it can be an extremely broad concept, though in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to denote profound wickedness. it is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal moral evil commonly associated with the word, or impersonal natural evil (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.
evil can denote profound immorality, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the human condition, where strife and suffering (cf. hinduism) are the true roots of evil. in certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force. definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives. elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve unbalanced behavior involving anger, revenge, fear, hatred, psychological trauma, expediency, selfishness, ignorance, destruction or neglect.
evil is sometimes perceived as the dualistic antagonistic binary opposite to good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated. in cultures with buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving "nirvana". the philosophical questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of good and evil, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues. while the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume an evildoer or doers.
some religions and philosophies deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.
the modern english word "evil" (old english ) and its cognates such as the german and dutch are widely considered to come from a proto-germanic reconstructed form of "*ubilaz", comparable to the hittite "huwapp-" ultimately from the proto-indo-european form and suffixed zero-grade form . other later germanic forms include middle english , , , old frisian (adjective and noun), old saxon , old high german , and gothic .
the root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown to be akin to modern german "" (although "evil" is normally translated as "das böse") with the basic idea of transgressing.
as with buddhism, in confucianism or taoism there is no direct analogue to the way "good and evil" are opposed although reference to "demonic influence" is common in chinese folk religion. confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. thus "evil" would correspond to wrong behavior. still less does it map into taoism, in spite of the centrality of dualism in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.
benedict de spinoza states
spinoza assumes a quasi-mathematical style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part iv of his "ethics" :
friedrich nietzsche, in a rejection of judeo-christian morality, addresses this in two works "beyond good and evil" and "on the genealogy of morals" where he essentially says that the natural, functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong).
carl jung, in his book "answer to job" and elsewhere, depicted evil as the "dark side of god". people tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their shadow onto others. jung interpreted the story of jesus as an account of god facing his own shadow.
even though the book may have had a sudden birth, its gestation period in jung's unconscious was long. the subject of god, and what jung saw as the dark side of god, was a lifelong preoccupation. an emotional and theoretical struggle with the core nature of deity is evident in jung'’s earliest fantasies and dreams, as well as in his complex relationships with his father (a traditional minister), his mother (who had a strong spiritual-mystical dimension), and the christian church itself. jung's account of his childhood in his quasi-autobiography, memories, dreams, reflections (new york: vintage, 1963; henceforth mdr), provides deep, personal background about his early religious roots– and conflicts.
in 2007, philip zimbardo suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a collective identity. this hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the stanford prison experiment, was published in the book "the lucifer effect: understanding how good people turn evil".
most monotheistic religions posit that the singular god is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good. the problem of evil asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved. scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). these religions tend to attribute the source of evil to something other than god, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.
polytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. these include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds (karma), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.
non-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by evolution, and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply following physical laws.
the bahá'í faith asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. all of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.
thus, evil does not exist and is relative to man. `abdu'l-bahá, son of the founder of the religion, in some answered questions states:
"nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."
thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. since god is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is good (genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.
evil according to a christian worldview is any action, thought, or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of god. this is shown through the law given in both the old and new testament. there is no moral action given in the bible that is contrary to god's character or god's will. therefore, evil in a christian worldview is contrasted by and in conflict with god's character or god's will. this evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of god.
christian theology draws its concept of evil from the old and new testaments. the christian bible exercises "the dominant influence upon ideas about god and evil in the western world." in the old testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to god as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the fallen angels satan in the new testament the greek word "poneros" is used to indicate unsuitability, while "kakos" is used to refer to opposition to god in the human realm. officially, the catholic church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the dominican theologian, thomas aquinas, who in "summa theologica" defines evil as the absence or privation of good. french-american theologian henri blocher describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. in common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that "ought not to be"."
in mormonism, mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the plan of salvation. see agency (lds church). evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of god. it is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to god.
christian science believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. misunderstanding god's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. this has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of god as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. christian scientists argue that even the most "evil" person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.
there is no concept of absolute evil in islam, as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense. although the quran mentions the biblical forbidden tree, it never refers to it as the 'tree of knowledge of good and evil'. within islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from god, whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as "evil" or "bad" are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will. much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey god's orders, harming others or putting themselves over god or others, is considered to be evil. evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.
unproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.
a typical understanding of evil is reflected by al-ash`ari founder of asharism. accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. an event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by god. since god is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of god's power, god's will determine, whether or not something is evil.
in judaism, evil is not real, it is per se not part of god's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the free will to choose good (life in olam haba) or bad (death in heaven). (deuteronomy 28:20) judaism stresses obedience to god's 613 commandments of the written torah (see also tanakh) and the collective body of jewish religious laws expounded in the oral torah and shulchan aruch (see also mishnah and the talmud). in judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with bar and bat mitzvah, when jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.
evil in the religion of ancient egypt is known as isfet, "disorder/violence". it is the opposite of maat, "order", and embodied by the serpent god apep, who routinely attempts to kill the sun god ra and is stopped by nearly every other deity. isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.
the primal duality in buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. one may infer from the general teachings of the buddha that the catalogued causes of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil.
practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. see "ten unvirtuous actions in buddhism". specifically, "evil" means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).
"what is evil? killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. and what is the root of evil? desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." gautama siddhartha, the founder of buddhism, 563–483 bc.
in hinduism, the concept of dharma or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect dharma, this war is called dharmayuddha. this division of good and evil is of major importance in both the hindu epics of ramayana and mahabharata. the main emphasis in hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. the hindu holy text, the bhagavad gita, speaks of the balance of good and evil. when this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.
in adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. at the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. in his writings guru arjan explains that, because god is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from god. and because god is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from god.
nevertheless, sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. these are known as the five thieves, called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action. these are:
one who gives in to the temptations of the five thieves is known as "manmukh", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. inversely, the "gurmukh, who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of sikhism. these are:
in the originally persian religion of zoroastrianism, the world is a battleground between the god ahura mazda (also called ormazd) and the malignant spirit angra mainyu (also called ahriman). the final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a day of judgement, in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. in afghan belief, angels and saints are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.
a fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. c. s. lewis, in "the abolition of man", maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as rape and murder. the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question. up until the mid-19th century, the united states—along with many other countries—practiced forms of slavery. as is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.
the nazis, during world war ii, considered genocide to be acceptable, as did the hutu interahamwe in the rwandan genocide. one might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. thus, while the ideological leaders of nazism and the hutu interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as "fundamentally" or "universally" evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil. hitler considered it a moral duty to destroy jews because he saw them as the root of all of germany's ills and the violence associated with communism. osama bin laden found it moral to kill all christians and jews because he saw islam as under attack by western and us influence, accusing the us and israel of forming a crusader-zionist alliance to destroy islam, and considering us troops in saudi arabia infidels in the land of islam's two holiest sites. he therefore considered non-muslims and shiite muslims evil people intent on destroying islamic purity and therefore heretic.
given his mixed record of efforts to give the cuban people free-of-charge healthcare and education as well as opposing us hegemony in latin america, while crushing all opposition and wrecking the cuban economy, fidel castro saw himself as a caribbean robin hood who considered the us and capitalism evil, while cuban americans, cuban dissidents, and other communism-bashing people saw castro as the personification of evil in late 20th-century cuban and latin american history, viewing his castroist ideology as just as evil as any other form of communism and bashing him for locking up dissidents and killing innocents by firing squads, while creating mayhem in the developing world by working to foment violent communist revolutions in the americas and many african countries.
views on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as ethics—which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:
one school of thought that holds that no "person" is evil and that only "acts" may be properly considered evil. psychologist and mediator marshall rosenberg claims that the root of violence is the very concept of "evil" or "badness". when we label someone as bad or evil, rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. it also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. he cites the use of language in nazi germany as being a key to how the german people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. he links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—"punitive justice"—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.he contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures where the idea of evil was non-existent. in such cultures when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.
psychologist albert ellis agrees, in his school of psychology called rational emotive behavioral therapy, or rebt. he says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. he further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.
american psychiatrist m. scott peck on the other hand, describes evil as "militant ignorance". the original judeo-christian concept of "sin" is as a process that leads one to "miss the mark" and not achieve perfection. peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopaths.
according to peck, an evil person:
he also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the my lai massacre and its attempted coverup illustrate. by this definition, acts of criminal and state terrorism would also be considered evil.
martin luther argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. he wrote, "seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. one must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the devil, so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings ... "
according to the "realist" schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon advantage; this approach to politics was put forth most famously by niccolò machiavelli, a 16th-century florentine writer who advised tyrants that "it is far safer to be feared than loved."
the international relations theories of realism and neorealism, sometimes called "realpolitik" advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly amoral and dangerous. political realists usually justify their perspectives by stating that morals and politics should be separated as two unrelated things, as exerting authority often involves doing something not moral. machiavelli wrote: "there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the prince."
anton lavey, founder of the church of satan, was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. he was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word "evil" is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.

the epistle to the hebrews, or letter to the hebrews, or in the greek manuscripts, simply to the hebrews ( πρὸς ἑβραίους) is one of the books of the new testament.
the text is traditionally attributed to paul the apostle, but doubt on pauline authorship in the roman church is reported by eusebius. modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, perhaps written in deliberate imitation of the style of paul. although the writer's style reflects some characteristics of paul's writing, there are some differences.
scholars of greek consider its writing to be more polished and eloquent than any other book of the new testament, and "the very carefully composed and studied greek of hebrews is not paul's spontaneous, volatile contextual greek". the book has earned the reputation of being a masterpiece. it has also been described as an intricate new testament book. scholars believe it was written for jewish christians who lived in jerusalem. its purpose was to exhort christians to persevere in the face of persecution. at this time, certain believers were considering turning back to judaism (the jewish system of law) to escape being persecuted for accepting christ as their saviour, now following this system of grace (saved by jesus' sacrifice on the cross). the theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of christ and his role as mediator between god and humanity.
the epistle opens with an exaltation of jesus as "the radiance of god's glory, the express image of his being, and upholding all things by his powerful word". the epistle presents jesus with the titles "pioneer" or "forerunner", "son" and "son of god", "priest" and "high priest".
the epistle casts jesus as both exalted son and high priest, a unique dual christology.
hebrews uses old testament quotations interpreted in light of first century rabbinical judaism. new testament and second temple judaism scholar eric mason argues that the conceptual background of the priestly christology of the epistle to the hebrews closely parallels presentations of the messianic priest and melchizedek in the qumran scrolls. in both hebrews and qumran a priestly figure is discussed in the context of a davidic figure; in both cases a divine decree appoints the priests to their eschatological duty; both priestly figures offer an eschatological sacrifice of atonement. although the author of hebrews was not directly influenced by qumran's "messiah of aaron", these and other conceptions did provide "a precedent... to conceive jesus similarly as a priest making atonement and eternal intercession in the heavenly sanctuary".
by the end of the first century there was no consensus on the author’s identity. clement of rome, barnabas, paul the apostle, and other names were proposed. others later suggested luke the evangelist, apollos, or his teacher priscilla as possible authors.
in the 3rd century, origen wrote of the letter,
"in the epistle entitled "to the hebrews" the diction does not exhibit the characteristic roughness of speech or phraseology admitted by the apostle [paul] himself, the construction of the sentences is closer to the greek usage, as anyone capable of recognising differences of style would agree. on the other hand the matter of the epistle is wonderful, and quite equal to the apostle's acknowledged writings: the truth of this would be admitted by anyone who has read the apostle carefully... if i were asked my personal opinion, i would say that the matter is the apostle's but the phraseology and construction are those of someone who remembered the apostle's teaching and wrote his own interpretation of what his master had said. so if any church regards this epistle as paul's, it should be commended for so doing, for the primitive church had every justification for handing it down as his. who wrote the epistle is known to god alone: the accounts that have reached us suggest that it was either clement, who became bishop of rome, or luke, who wrote the gospel and the acts." further, "men of old have handed it down as paul's, but who wrote the epistle god only knows".
in the 4th century, jerome and augustine of hippo supported paul's authorship: the church largely agreed to include hebrews as the fourteenth letter of paul, and affirmed this authorship until the reformation. scholars argued that in the 13th chapter of hebrews, timothy is referred to as a companion. timothy was paul's missionary companion in the same way jesus sent disciples out in pairs. also, the writer states that he wrote the letter from "italy", which also at the time fits paul. the difference in style is explained as simply an adjustment to a distinct audience, to the jewish christians who were being persecuted and pressured to go back to traditional judaism.
many scholars now believe that the author was one of paul's pupils or associates, citing stylistic differences between hebrews and the other pauline epistles. recent scholarship has favored the idea that the author was probably a leader of a predominantly jewish congregation to whom he or she was writing.
because of its anonymity, it had some trouble being accepted as part of the christian canon, being classed with the antilegomena. eventually it was accepted as scripture because of its sound theology, eloquent presentation, and other intrinsic factors. in antiquity, certain circles began to ascribe it to paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.
the original king james version of the bible titled the work "the epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews". however, the kjv's attribution to paul was only a guess, and is currently disputed by recent research. its vastly different style, different theological focus, different spiritual experience, different greek vocabulary – all are believed to make paul's authorship of hebrews increasingly indefensible. at present, neither modern scholarship nor church teaching ascribes hebrews to paul.
a.j. gordon ascribes the authorship of hebrews to priscilla, writing that "it is evident that the holy spirit made this woman priscilla a teacher of teachers". originally proposed by adolf von harnack in 1900, harnack’s reasoning won the support of prominent bible scholars of the early twentieth century. harnack believes the letter was written in rome – not to the church, but to the inner circle. in setting forth his evidence for priscillan authorship, he finds it amazing that the name of the author was blotted out by the earliest tradition. citing , he says it was written by a person of "high standing and apostolic teacher of equal rank with timothy". if luke, clemens, barnabas, or apollos had written it, harnack believes their names would not have been obliterated.
donald guthrie’s commentary "the letter to the hebrews" (1983) mentions priscilla by name as a suggested author.
believing the author to have been priscilla, ruth hoppin posits that the name was omitted either to suppress its female authorship, or to protect the letter itself from suppression.
also convinced that priscilla was the author of hebrews, gilbert bilezikian, professor of biblical studies at wheaton college, remarks on "the conspiracy of anonymity in the ancient church," and reasons: "the lack of any firm data concerning the identity of the author in the extant writings of the church suggests a deliberate blackout more than a case of collective loss of memory."
the use of tabernacle terminology in hebrews has been used to date the epistle before the destruction of the temple, the idea being that knowing about the destruction of both jerusalem and the temple would have influenced the development of the author's overall argument. therefore, the most probable date for its composition is the second half of the year 63 or the beginning of 64, according to the "catholic encyclopedia".
however, there is no way to prove the actual dating of this writing, even from within the internal structure of the writing. throughout the writing, all mentions of the priestly acts of worship are connected to the tabernacle in sinai, as built by moses, with no mention of the temple in jerusalem. an argument for a later date of the hebrew text can be assumed due to the absence of any mention of the temple in jerusalem. if the hebrew writer composed this message after the first century it would be entirely possible that the destruction of the jerusalem temple and that of the city of jerusalem would not be relevant to the writer. thus, some academic scholars hold to a much later date of composition to the hebrew writing.
scholars have suggested that hebrews is part of an internal new testament debate between the extreme judaizers (who argued that non-jews must convert to judaism before they can receive the holy spirit of jesus' new covenant) versus the extreme antinomians (who argued that jews must reject god's commandments and that jewish law was no longer in effect). james and paul represent the moderates of each faction, respectively, and peter served as moderator.
it sets before the jew the claims of christianity – to bring the jew to the full realization of the relation of judaism to christianity, to make clear that christ has fulfilled those temporary and provisional institutions, and has thus abolished them. this view is commonly referred to as supersessionism.
those to whom hebrews is written seem to have begun to doubt whether jesus could really be the messiah for whom they were waiting, because they believed the messiah prophesied in the hebrew scriptures was to come as a militant king and destroy the enemies of his people. jesus, however, came as a mere man who was arrested by the jewish leaders and who suffered and was crucified by the romans. and although he was seen resurrected, he still left the earth and his people, who now face persecution rather than victory. the book of hebrews solves this problem by arguing that the hebrew scriptures also foretold that the messiah would be a priest (although of a different sort than the traditional levitical priests) and jesus came to fulfill this role, as a sacrificial offering to god, to atone for sins. his role of a king is yet to come, and so those who follow him should be patient and not be surprised that they suffer for now.
some scholars today believe the document was written to prevent apostasy. some have interpreted apostasy to mean a number of different things, such as a group of christians in one sect leaving for another more conservative sect, one of which the author disapproves. some have seen apostasy as a move from the christian assembly to pagan ritual. in light of a possibly jewish-christian audience, the apostasy in this sense may be in regard to jewish-christians leaving the christian assembly to return to the jewish synagogue. the author writes, "let us hold fast to our confession". the epistle has been viewed as a long, rhetorical argument for having confidence in the new way to god revealed in jesus christ.
the book could be argued to affirm special creation. it affirms that god by his son, jesus christ, made the worlds. "god... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son... by whom also he made the worlds". the epistle also emphasizes the importance of faith. "through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear".
hebrews is a very consciously "literary" document. the purity of its greek was noted by clement of alexandria, according to eusebius ("historia eccl.", vi, xiv), and origen of alexandria asserted that every competent judge must recognize a great difference between this epistle and those of paul (eusebius, vi, xxv).
this letter consists of two strands: an expositional or doctrinal strand, and a hortatory or strongly urging strand which punctuates the exposition parenthetically at key points as warnings to the readers.
hebrews does not fit the form of a traditional hellenistic epistle, lacking a proper prescript. modern scholars generally believe this book was originally a sermon or homily, although possibly modified after it was delivered to include the travel plans, greetings and closing.
hebrews contains many references to the old testament – specifically to its septuagint text.
the "epistle to the hebrews" is notable for the manner in which it expresses the divine nature of christ. as a.c. purdy summarized for "the interpreter's bible" (1955):
we may sum up our author’s christology negatively by saying that he has nothing to do with the older hebrew messianic hopes of a coming son of david, who would be a divinely empowered human leader to bring in the kingdom of god on earth; and that while he still employs the figure of a militant, apocalyptic king... who will come again..., this is not of the essence of his thought about christ.
positively, our author presents christ as divine in nature, and solves any possible objection to a divine being who participates in human experience, especially in the experience of death, by the priestly analogy. he seems quite unconscious of the logical difficulties of his position proceeding from the assumption that christ is both divine and human, at least human in experience although hardly in nature.
mikeal parsons has commented:
if the humanity of jesus is an important theme for hebrews, how much more is jesus’ deity. while this theme of exaltation is asserted ‘in many and various ways’ we shall content ourselves by considering how the writer addresses this theme by asserting jesus’ superiority to a) angels, and b) moses. the first chapter of hebrews stresses the superiority of the son to the angels. the very name ‘son’ indicates superiority. this exaltation theme, in which the son is contrasted with the angels (1:4), is expanded in the following string of ot quotations (1:5-13). while some have understood the catena as referring primarily to christ’s pre-existence, it is more likely that the verses should be understood, ‘as a christological hymn which traces the entire christ event, including the pre-existence, earthly life, and exaltation of christ’. the overall structure of the catena seems to point to exaltation as the underlying motif... at least it may be concluded that the superiority of the son is demonstrated by this comparison/contrast with angels.
peter rhea jones has reminded us that ‘moses is not merely one of the figures compared unfavourably to jesus’; but rather, ‘moses and jesus are yoked throughout the entirety of the epistle’. allowing that moses is much more than a ‘whipping boy’ for the author, the fact remains that the figure moses is utilized as a basis for christology. while there are several references to moses, only two will be needed to demonstrate jesus’ superiority. the first passage to be considered is hebrews 3:1-6. d’angelo and others regard the larger context of this passage (3:1-4:16) to be the superiority of christ’s message to the law. while the comparison between jesus and the angels is based on a number of ot citations, the comparison of jesus and moses turns on a single verse, nu. 12:7. like the angels (1:14), moses was a servant who witnessed, as it were, to the son. in other words, ‘faithful sonship is superior to faithful servantship’. the son is once again exalted. the exaltation theme finds expression in a more opaque way at 11:26. here in the famous chapter on faith moses is said to count ‘abuse suffered for the christ greater wealth than the treasures of egypt’. the portrait of moses drawn here is that of a martyr, and a christian martyr at that. in effect, moses joins that great cloud of witnesses who looked to jesus as pioneer and perfecter of faith. once again, christ’s superiority is asserted, this time over moses and the entire mosaic epoch.
in summary, the writer [of hebrews] stressed the sonship of jesus and expressed it in a three-stage christology of pre-existence, humanity, and exaltation.

esther is described in the book of esther as a jewish queen of the persian king ahasuerus (commonly identified as xerxes i, reigned 486–465 bce). in the narrative, ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, vashti, refuses to obey him, and esther is chosen for her beauty. the king's chief advisor, haman, is offended by esther's cousin and guardian, mordecai, and gets permission from the king to have all the jews in the kingdom killed. esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the jews to kill their enemies, and they do so.
her story is the traditional basis for purim, which is celebrated on the date given in the story for when haman's order was to go into effect, which is the same day that the jews killed their enemies after the plan was reversed.
according to most scholars, the name "esther" is derived from the mesopotamian goddess ishtar and/or the persian word stara, "star".
the book of daniel provides accounts of jews in exile being assigned names relating to babylonian gods and "mordecai" is understood to mean servant of marduk, a babylonian god. "esther" may have been a different hebrew interpretation from the proto-semitic root "star/'morning/evening star'", which descended with the /th/ into the ugaritic "athtiratu" and arabian "athtar". the derivation must then have been secondary for the initial ayin to be confused with an aleph (both represented by vowels in akkadian), and the second consonant descended as a /s/ (like in the aramaic "bright star"), rather than a /sh/ as in hebrew and most commonly in akkadian.
even in talmudic times it was realized that the name esther was of foreign origin. according to one opinion mentioned in the talmud (tractate megillah 13a) and yalkut shimoni (1053:7) as well as targum sheni the name esther comes from אסתהר (‘īstəhăr), the morning star venus. modern scholars starting with assyriologist peter jensen added on to this by connecting esther with ishtar babylonian goddess of the planet venus, and this view came to be adopted by almost all commentators.
a. s. yahuda conjectured that the name esther is derived from a reconstructed median word "astra" meaning myrtle. this would match her hebrew name as recorded in the bible, "hadassah", also meaning "myrtle".
in the narrative, king ahasuerus is drunk at a festival and orders his queen, vashti, to appear before him and his guests to display her beauty. when she refuses to come, he deposes her and seeks a new queen through a sort of beauty pageant. esther, an orphan daughter of a benjamite named abihail and under the protection of her cousin mordecai, who are members of the jewish exile community in persia, is chosen.
later, mordecai refuses to bow to haman the agagite, who was recently made ahasuerus' highest advisor, and haman requests and is given permission to order all the jews in persia to be killed. when esther learns of this, mordecai tells her to reveal to the king that she is jewish and to ask him to repeal the order. esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned and the king does not want to see her; mordecai urges her to try. she goes to the king, and the king welcomes her, and says he will give her anything she wants. instead of asking directly about the order, she invites the king and haman to a banquet the next day. during the banquet, the king again asked esther if there is anything she wants, and this time she asks the king to spare her life and that of all of the jews. the king asks who was threatening them, and she names haman. haman throws himself at her feet; the king thinks that haman is attacking her and orders him to be put to death, and gives all haman's possessions to esther. esther tells the king about mordecai's role in her life, and the king makes mordecai his highest advisor. esther then asks the king to revoke the order, and king allows esther and mordecai to do so, however they wish. they send out an order in the king's name that jews can assemble and defend themselves, and can kill anyone who threatens them, and their families, and take their goods. on the thirteenth day of adar, the same day that haman had set for them to be killed, the jews do so in one city, killing 500 people but not taking plunder, and they kill around 75,000 the next day again not taking plunder, and then they feast.
the jews established an annual feast, the feast of purim, in memory of their deliverance. haman set the date of adar 13 to commence his campaign against the jews. this determined the date of the festival of purim.
dianne tidball argues that while vashti is a "feminist icon", esther is a post-feminist icon.
abraham kuyper notes some "disagreeable aspects" to her character: that she should not have agreed to take vashti's place, that she refrained from saving her nation until her own life was threatened, and that she carries out bloodthirsty vengeance.
the tale opens with esther as beautiful and obedient, but also a relatively passive figure. during the course of the story, she evolves into someone who takes a decisive role in her own future and that of her people. according to sidnie white crawford, "esther's position in a male court mirrors that of the jews in a gentile world, with the threat of danger ever present below the seemingly calm surface." esther is related to daniel in that both represent a "type" for jews living in diaspora, and hoping to live a successful life in an alien environment.
according to susan zaeske, by virtue of the fact that esther used only rhetoric to convince the king to save her people, the story of esther is a "rhetoric of exile and empowerment that, for millennia, has notably shaped the discourse of marginalized peoples such as jews, women, and african americans", persuading those who have power over them.
given the great historical link between persian and jewish history, modern day persian jews are called "esther's children". a building venerated as being the tomb of esther and mordechai is located in hamadan, iran, although the village of kfar bar'am in northern israel also claims to be the burial place of queen esther.
there are several , including one by millais. "esther before ahasuerus" is one of the most commonly depicted parts of the story.
the status of esther as a canonical book of the bible has historically been under dispute. for example, in the first several centuries of christianity, esther does not appear in the lists of books produced by melito, athanasius, cyril, gregory of nazianzus, and others. additionally, no copies of esther were found at qumran in the contents of the dead sea scrolls. nevertheless, by the fourth century ce, the majority of western churches accepted esther as a part of their bibles.
esther is also commemorated as a matriarch in the calendar of saints of the lutheran church–missouri synod on may 24. she is also recognized as a saint in the eastern orthodox and coptic orthodox churches.
"the septuagint edition of esther contains six parts (totaling 107 verses) not found in the hebrew bible. although these interpretations originally may have been composed in hebrew, they survive only in greek texts. because the hebrew bible’s version of esther’s story contains neither prayers nor even a single reference to god, greek redactors apparently felt compelled to give the tale a more explicit religious orientation, alluding to "god" or the "lord" fifty times." these additions to esther in the apocrypha were added approximately in the second or first century bce.

entamoeba is a genus of amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals.
in 1875, fedor lösch described the first proven case of amoebic dysentery in st. petersburg, russia. he referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as "amoeba coli"; however, it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name. the genus "entamoeba" was defined by casagrandi and barbagallo for the species "entamoeba coli", which is known to be a commensal organism. lösch's organism was renamed "entamoeba histolytica" by fritz schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. for a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus "entamoeba" was transferred to "endamoeba", a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. this move was reversed by the international commission on zoological nomenclature in the late 1950s, and "entamoeba" has stayed 'stable' ever since.
several species are found in humans and animals. "entamoeba histolytica" is the pathogen responsible for invasive 'amoebiasis' (which includes amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses). others such as "entamoeba coli" (not to be confused with "escherichia coli") and "entamoeba dispar" are harmless. with the exception of "entamoeba gingivalis", which lives in the mouth, and "e. moshkovskii", which is frequently isolated from river and lake sediments, all "entamoeba" species are found in the intestines of the animals they infect. "entamoeba invadens" is a species that can cause a disease similar to "e. histolytica" but in reptiles. in contrast to other species, "e. invadens" forms cysts in vitro in the absence of bacteria and is used as a model system to study this aspect of the life cycle. many other species of "entamoeba" have been described, and it is likely that many others remain to be found.
"entamoeba" cells are small, with a single nucleus and typically a single lobose pseudopod taking the form of a clear anterior bulge. they have a simple life cycle. the trophozoite (feeding-dividing form) is approximately 10-20 μm in diameter and feeds primarily on bacteria. it divides by simple binary fission to form two smaller daughter cells. almost all species form cysts, the stage involved in transmission (the exception is "entamoeba gingivalis"). depending on the species, these can have one, four or eight nuclei and are variable in size; these characteristics help in species identification.
"entamoeba" belongs to the archamoebae, which like many other anaerobic eukaryotes lack mitochondria. this group also includes "endolimax" and "iodamoeba", which also live in animal intestines and are similar in appearance to "entamoeba", although this may partly be due to convergence. also in this group are the free-living amoebo-flagellates of the genus "mastigamoeba" and related genera. certain other genera of symbiotic amoebae, such as "endamoeba", might prove to be synonyms of "entamoeba" but this is still unclear.
studying "entamoeba invadens", david biron of the weizmann institute of science and coworkers found that about one third of the cells are unable to separate unaided and recruit a neighboring amoeba (dubbed the "midwife") to complete the fission. he writes:
they also reported a similar behavior in "dictyostelium".
since "e. histolytica" does not form cysts in the absence of bacteria, "e. invadens" has become used as a model for encystation studies as it will form cysts under axenic growth conditions, which simplifies analysis. after inducing encystation in "e. invadens", dna replication increases initially and then slows down. on completion of encystation, predominantly tetra-nucleate cysts are formed along with some uni-, bi- and tri-nucleate cysts.
uninucleated trophozoites convert into cysts in a process called encystation. the number of nuclei in the cyst varies from 1 to 8 among species and is one of the characteristics used to tell species apart. of the species already mentioned, "entamoeba coli" forms cysts with 8 nuclei while the others form tetra-nucleated cysts. since "e. histolytica" does not form cysts "in vitro" in the absence of bacteria, it is not possible to study the differentiation process in detail in that species. instead the differentiation process is studied using "e. invadens", a reptilian parasite that causes a very similar disease to "e. histolytica" and which can be induced to encyst "in vitro". until recently there was no genetic transfection vector available for this organism and detailed study at the cellular level was not possible. however, recently a transfection vector was developed and the transfection conditions for "e. invadens" were optimised which should enhance the research possibilities at the molecular level of the differentiation process.
in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, homologous recombination (hr) ordinarily occurs during meiosis. the meiosis-specific recombinase, dmc1, is required for efficient meiotic hr, and dmc1 is expressed in "e. histolytica". the purified dmc1 from "e. histolytica" forms presynaptic filaments and catalyzes atp-dependent homologous dna pairing and dna strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs. the dna pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) hop2-mnd1. these processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that "e. histolytica" undergoes meiosis.
studies of "e. invadens" found that, during the conversion from the tetraploid uninucleate trophozoite to the tetranucleate cyst, homologous recombination is enhanced. expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increased during encystations. these findings in "e. invadens", combined with evidence from studies of "e. histolytica" indicate the presence of meiosis in the "entamoeba".

the england national football team represents england in senior men's international football and is controlled by the football association, the governing body for football in england.
england is one of the two oldest national teams in football, alongside scotland, whom they played in the world's first international football match in 1872. england's home ground is wembley stadium, london, and their headquarters are at st george's park, burton upon trent. the team's manager is gareth southgate. although part of the united kingdom, england's representative side plays in major professional tournaments, but not the olympic games.
since first entering the tournament in 1950, england has qualified for the fifa world cup 15 times. they won the 1966 world cup, when they hosted the finals, and finished fourth in 1990 and 2018. since first entering in 1964, england have never won the uefa european championship, with their best performances being a third-place finish in 1968 and 1996, the latter as hosts.
the england national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as scotland. a representative match between england and scotland was played on 5 march 1870, having been organised by the football association. a return fixture was organised by representatives of scottish football teams on 30 november 1872. this match, played at hamilton crescent in scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association. over the next 40 years, england played exclusively with the other three home nations—scotland, wales and ireland—in the british home championship.
at first, england had no permanent home stadium. they joined fifa in 1906 and played their first ever games against countries other than the home nations on a tour of central europe in 1908. wembley stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. the relationship between england and fifa became strained, and this resulted in their departure from fifa in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. as a result, they did not compete in a world cup until 1950, in which they were beaten in a 1–0 defeat by the united states, failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.
their first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a 0–2 loss to the republic of ireland, on 21 september 1949 at goodison park. a 6–3 loss in 1953 to hungary, was their second defeat by a foreign team at wembley. in the return match in budapest, hungary won 7–1. this stands as england's largest ever defeat. after the game, a bewildered syd owen said, "it was like playing men from outer space". in the 1954 fifa world cup, england reached the quarter-finals for the first time, and lost 4–2 to reigning champions uruguay.
although walter winterbottom was appointed as england's first ever full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until alf ramsey took over in 1963. the 1966 fifa world cup was hosted in england and ramsey guided england to victory with a 4–2 win against west germany after extra time in the final, during which geoff hurst scored a hat-trick. in uefa euro 1968, the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by yugoslavia.
england qualified for the 1970 fifa world cup in mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by west germany. england had been 2–0 up, but were eventually beaten 3–2 after extra time. they failed in qualification for the 1974 fifa world cup, leading to ramsey's dismissal.
ramsey was succeeded by don revie between 1974 and 1977, but the team failed to qualify for uefa euro 1976 and the 1978 fifa world cup. under ron greenwood, they managed to qualify for the 1982 fifa world cup in spain (the first time competitively since 1962); despite not losing a game, they were eliminated in the second group stage.
bobby robson managed england from 1982 to 1990. although the team failed to qualify for uefa euro 1984, they reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 fifa world cup, losing 2–1 to argentina in a game made famous by two goals by maradona for very contrasting reasons. england striker gary lineker finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.
england went on to lose every match at uefa euro 1988. they next achieved their second best result in the 1990 fifa world cup by finishing fourth – losing again to west germany in a semi-final finishing 1–1 after extra time, then 3–4 in england's first penalty shoot-out. despite losing to italy in the third place play-off, the members of the england team were given bronze medals identical to the italians'. the england team of 1990 were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for a spectacular open-top bus parade.
the 1990s saw four england managers follow robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. graham taylor was robson's immediate successor. england failed to win any matches at uefa euro 1992, drawing with tournament winners denmark and later with france, before being eliminated by host nation sweden. the team then failed to qualify for the 1994 fifa world cup after losing a controversial game against the netherlands in rotterdam, which resulted in taylor's resignation.
between 1994 and 1996, terry venables managed the team. at uefa euro 1996, held in england, they equalled their best performance at a european championship, reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via a penalty shoot-out loss to germany. england striker alan shearer was the tournament's top scorer with five goals. venables resigned following investigations into his financial activities.
venables' successor, glenn hoddle, similarly left the job for non-footballing reasons after just one international tournament – the 1998 fifa world cup — in which england were eliminated in the second round again by argentina and again on penalties (after a 2–2 draw). following hoddle's departure, kevin keegan took england to uefa euro 2000, but the team left in the group stage and he resigned shortly afterwards.
sven-göran eriksson took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-english manager. he guided england to the quarter-finals of the 2002 fifa world cup, uefa euro 2004 and the 2006 fifa world cup. england lost only five competitive matches during his tenure, and england rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. eriksson's contract was extended by the fa by two years, to include uefa euro 2008, but was terminated by them after the 2006 world cup.
steve mcclaren was then appointed as head coach, but after failing to qualify for euro 2008 was sacked on 22 november 2007. the following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, italian fabio capello, whose experience included spells at juventus and real madrid. england won all but one of their qualifying games for the 2010 fifa world cup, but at the tournament itself, england drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure. they progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4–1 by germany, their heaviest defeat in a world cup finals tournament match. in february 2012, capello resigned from his role as england manager, following a disagreement with the fa over their request to remove john terry from team captaincy after accusations of racial abuse concerning the player.
in may 2012, roy hodgson was announced as the new manager, just six weeks before uefa euro 2012. england managed to finish top of their group, but exited the championships in the quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out, against italy. in the 2014 fifa world cup, england were eliminated at the group stage for the first time since the 1958 world cup, and the first time at a major tournament since euro 2000. england qualified unbeaten for uefa euro 2016, but were ultimately eliminated in the round of 16, losing 2–1 to iceland. hodgson resigned as manager immediately, and just under a month later was replaced by sam allardyce. after only 67 days allardyce resigned from his managerial post by mutual agreement, after alleged breach of rules of the fa, making him the shortest serving permanent england manager.
gareth southgate, then the coach of the england under-21 team, was put in temporary charge of the national team until november of that year, before being given the position on a permanent basis. under southgate, england qualified for the 2018 fifa world cup and came second in their group at the tournament. they defeated colombia on penalties in the first knock-out round, and then beat sweden 2–0 in the quarter-final to reach only their third world cup semi-final. in the semi-final, they were beaten 2–1 in extra time by croatia and then were beaten by belgium for a second time, 2–0, in the third place match. england striker harry kane finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals.
england's traditional home colours are white shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. the team has periodically worn an all-white kit.
although england's first away kits were blue, england's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. in 1996, england's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. this kit was only worn three times, including against germany in the semi-final of euro 1996 but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the england away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. the away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.
england have occasionally had a third kit. at the 1970 world cup england wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against czechoslovakia. they had a kit similar to brazil's, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. for the world cup in 1986 england had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in mexico 16 years before and england retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.
umbro first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959–1965 with bukta and 1974–1984 with admiral. nike purchased umbro in 2008 and took over as kit supplier in 2013 following their sale of the umbro brand.
the motif of the england national football team has three lions "passant guardant", the emblem of king richard i, who reigned from 1189 to 1199. in 1872, english players wore white jerseys emblazoned with the three lions crest of the football association. the lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance. initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the fa was given an official coat of arms by the college of arms; this introduced ten tudor roses, one for each of the regional branches of the fa. since 2003, england top their logo with a star to recognise their world cup win in 1966; this was first embroidered onto the left sleeve of the home kit, and a year later was moved to its current position, first on the away shirt.
for the first 50 years of their existence, england played their home matches all around the country. they initially used cricket grounds before later moving on to football clubs' stadiums. the original empire stadium was built in wembley, london, for the british empire exhibition.
england played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against scotland and for the next 27 years wembley was used as a venue for matches against scotland only. the stadium later became known simply as wembley stadium and it became england's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. in october 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a defeat.
this stadium was demolished during the period of 2002–2003, and work began to completely rebuild it. during this time, england played at venues across the country, though by the time of the 2006 world cup qualification, this had largely settled down to having manchester united's old trafford stadium as the primary venue, with newcastle united's st. james' park used on occasions when old trafford was unavailable.
they returned to the new wembley stadium in march 2007. the stadium is now owned by the football association, via its subsidiary wembley national stadium limited.
all england matches are broadcast with full commentary on talksport and bbc radio 5 live. from the 2008–09 season until the 2017–18 season, england's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on itv (often with the exception of stv, the itv franchisee in central and northern scotland). england's away qualifiers for the 2010 world cup were shown on setanta sports until that company's collapse. as a result of setanta sports's demise, england's world cup qualifier in ukraine on 10 october 2009 was shown in the united kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. this one-off event was the first time an england game had been screened in such a way. the number of subscribers, paying between £4.99 and £11.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000. in 2018, sky sports broadcast the england nations league and in-season friendlies, until 2021 and itv broadcast the qualifiers and pre-tournament friendlies, until 2022.

england first appeared at the 1950 fifa world cup, and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 fifa world cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. they are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside spain. the national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one fifa world cup title. the england team won their first and only world cup title in 1966. the tournament was played on home soil, and england defeated west germany 4–2 in the final. in 1990, england finished in fourth place, losing 2–1 to host nation italy in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions west germany in the semi-final. they also finished in fourth place in 2018. the team also reached the quarter-final stage in 1954, 1962, 1970, 1986, 2002 and 2006.
england failed to qualify for the world cup in 1974, 1978 and 1994. the team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in 1950, 1958 and, most recently, the 2014 fifa world cup, after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, versus italy and uruguay in group d. in 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. in 2010, england suffered its most resounding world cup defeat, 4–1 to germany, in the round of 16. this after drawing with the united states and algeria, and defeating slovenia 1–0, in the group stage.
england's greatest achievements at the uefa european championship have been to finish in third place in 1968 and 1996. england hosted euro 96, and have qualified for nine uefa european championship finals tournaments, tied for fourth best by number of appearances. the team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions, in 2004 and 2012. the team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980, 1988, 1992 and 2000. the team did not enter in 1960, and failed to qualify for the finals in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984, and 2008.

eureka is a city located in st. louis county, missouri, united states, adjacent to the cities of wildwood and pacific, along interstate 44. it is in the extreme southwest of the greater st. louis metro area. as of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 10,189. since 1971, eureka has been known as the home of the amusement park six flags st. louis.
the village of eureka was platted in 1858 along the route of the pacific railroad. by 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes. according to the eureka chamber of commerce, railroad workers while clearing the way for the track and the next railroad camp saw eureka, level land with little to clear, and declared, "eureka!" greek meaning "i have found it." thus, eureka was founded. in 1898, eureka became home to the st. louis children's industrial farm, established to give children from st. louis tenement neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. it later became camp wyman (now part of wyman center) and is one of the oldest camps in the united states. eureka was incorporated as a fourth-class city on april 7, 1954.
the railroad town of allenton is a former community on u.s. route 66 located (now) at the junction of interstate 44 and business loop 44 in western st. louis county. in 1985, it was annexed by the city of eureka. the town is currently rural, with adjacent farmland and forested ozark ridges. this community was declared blighted by st. louis county in 1973.

in physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (pvt), or internal energy. equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.
at present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions. an example of an equation of state correlates densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures, known as the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid.
another common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including neutron stars, dense matter (quark–gluon plasmas) and radiation fields. a related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology.
equations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.
in a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for pvt calculations in process engineering problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. a successful pvt model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids, and pipe sizing.
measurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.
boyle's law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. in 1662, the irish physicist and chemist robert boyle performed a series of experiments employing a j-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. the pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. through these experiments, boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. in mathematical form, this can be stated as:
the above relationship has also been attributed to edme mariotte and is sometimes referred to as mariotte's law. however, mariotte's work was not published until 1676.
in 1787 the french physicist jacques charles found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. later, in 1802, joseph louis gay-lussac published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:
dalton's law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.
mathematically, this can be represented for "n" species as:
in 1834, émile clapeyron combined boyle's law and charles' law into the first statement of the "ideal gas law". initially, the law was formulated as "pv" = "r"("t" + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees celsius), where "r" is the gas constant. however, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the celsius scale was defined with 0°c = 273.15k, giving:
in 1873, j. d. van der waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. his new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the redlich–kwong equation of state and the soave modification of redlich-kwong.
for a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form
an equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. in the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. any consistent set of units may be used, although si units are preferred. absolute temperature refers to use of the kelvin (k) or rankine (°r) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.
the classical ideal gas law may be written
in the form shown above, the equation of state is thus
if the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows
where formula_19 is the density, formula_20 is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), formula_21 is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"), formula_22 is the specific heat at constant volume, and formula_23 is the specific heat at constant pressure.
cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of v.
the van der waals equation of state may be written:
where formula_25 is molar volume. the substance-specific constants formula_26 and formula_27 can be calculated from the critical properties formula_28 and formula_29 (noting that formula_29 is the molar volume at the critical point) as:
also written as
proposed in 1873, the van der waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. in this landmark equation formula_26 is called the attraction parameter and formula_27 the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. while the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. while the van der waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.
the van der waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, "improved" due to two independent reasons:
with the reduced state variables, i.e. v=v/v, p=p/p and t=t/t, the reduced form of the van der waals equation can be formulated:
the benefit of this form is that for given t and p, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using cardano's method for the reduced cubic form:
for p<1 and t<1, the system is in a state of vapor–liquid equilibrium. the reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. the largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.
introduced in 1949, the redlich-kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. it is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. while superior to the van der waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor–liquid equilibria. however, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.
the redlich-kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):
where ω is the acentric factor for the species.
this formulation for formula_54 is due to graboski and daubert. the original formulation from soave is:
for hydrogen:
we can also write it in the polynomial form, with:
then we have:
where formula_60 is the universal gas constant and z=pv/(rt) is the compressibility factor.
in 1972 g. soave replaced the 1/ term of the redlich-kwong equation with a function α(t,ω) involving the temperature and the acentric factor (the resulting equation is also known as the soave-redlich-kwong equation of state; srk eos). the α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.
note especially that this replacement changes the definition of "a" slightly, as the formula_61 is now to the second power.
the srk eos may be written as
where
where formula_54 and other parts of the srk eos is defined in the srk eos section.
a downside of the srk eos, and other cubic eos, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. peneloux et alios (1982) proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation
where formula_66 is an additional fluid component parameter that translates the molar volume slightly. on the liquid branch of the eos, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. on the gas branch of the eos, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.
in the first version only formula_67 is translated,
in the second version both formula_67 and formula_70 are translated, or the translation of formula_67 is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter . this gives
the c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by
the c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation
where the rackett compressibility factor formula_75 can be estimated by
a nice feature with the volume translation method of peneloux et al. (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations. it should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic eoss if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected eos.
in polynomial form:
where formula_81 is the acentric factor of the species, formula_60 is the universal gas constant and formula_83 is compressibility factor.
the peng–robinson equation of state (pr eos) was developed in 1976 at the university of alberta by ding-yu peng and donald robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:
for the most part the peng–robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones. the departure functions of the peng–robinson equation are given on a separate article.
the analytic values of its characteristic constants are:
a modification to the attraction term in the peng–robinson equation of state published by stryjek and vera in 1986 (prsv) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor.
the modification is:
where formula_88 is an adjustable pure component parameter. stryjek and vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. at reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set formula_89 and simply use formula_90. for alcohols and water the value of formula_91 may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.
a subsequent modification published in 1986 (prsv2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.
the modification is:
where formula_88, formula_94, and formula_95 are adjustable pure component parameters.
prsv2 is particularly advantageous for vle calculations. while prsv1 does offer an advantage over the peng–robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations. the highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors. it is therefore recommended that prsv2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design. however, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
one thing to note is that in the prsv equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. above the critical temperature, the prsv alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. this is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. several alternate formulations have been proposed. some well known ones are by twu et all or by mathias and copeman.
peng,-robinson-babalola equation of state:  (prb)
babalola [ ] modified the peng–robinson equation of state as:
formula_96
the attractive force parameter ‘a’, which was considered to be a constant with respect to pressure in peng–robinson eos as well as in other eos was modified by babalola. the modification, in which parameter ‘a’ was treated as a variable with respect to pressure for multi component multi-phase high density reservoir systems was to improve accuracy in the prediction of properties of complex reservoir fluids for pvt modeling. the variation was represented with a linear equation:
a = ap + a
where a and a represent the slope and the intercept respectively of the straight line obtained when values of parameter ‘a’ are plotted against pressure.
this modification increases the accuracy of peng–robinson equation of state for heavier fluids particularly at pressure ranges (>30mpa) and eliminates the need for tuning the equation of state before use thereby minimizing the cost of using the eos in the oil industry.
the elliott, suresh, and donohue (esd) equation of state was proposed in 1990. the equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the peng–robinson eos in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der waals repulsive term. the eos accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). the eos itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.

the cubic-plus-association (cpa) equation of state combines the soave-redlich-kwong equation with an association term from wertheim theory. the development of the equation began in 1995 as a research project that was funded by shell, and in 1996 an article was published which presented the cpa equation of state.
where "a" is associated with the interaction between molecules and "b" takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the van der waals equation.
the reduced coordinates are:
although usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from statistical mechanics. this equation is also called the kamerlingh onnes equation. if appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. "a" is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. the second virial coefficient "b" corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, "c" to triplets, and so on. accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms. the coefficients "b", "c", "d", etc. are functions of temperature only.
one of the most accurate equations of state is that from benedict-webb-rubin-starling shown next. it was very close to a virial equation of state. if the exponential term in it is expanded to two taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:
note that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. the second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. the third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.

statistical associating fluid theory (saft) equations of state use statistical mechanical methods (in particular perturbation theory) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system. the idea of a saft equation of state was first proposed by chapman et al. in 1989, but since then many different saft equations of state have been proposed. often saft equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another. one popular saft equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments (pc-saft). in general, saft equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.
multiparameter equations of state (meos) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. meos's represent the helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:
where:
the reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.
other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the meos by using appropriate derivatives of the helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the meos is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. typical meos use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. meos are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. mixture models also exist.
when considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions, sonic shock lithotripsy, and sonoluminescence, the stiffened equation of state is often used:
where formula_137 is the internal energy per unit mass, formula_138 is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and formula_139 is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. the magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).
the equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by formula_140.
thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is "already" under about 20,000 atmospheres (2 gpa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100 kpa to 200 kpa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1 mpa to 2000.2 mpa).
this equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.
an ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state
where formula_41 is the pressure, formula_143 is the mass density, and formula_144 is the speed of sound.
the equation of state for an ideal bose gas is
where α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, α = 3/2), "z" is exp("μ"/"kt") where "μ" is the chemical potential, li is the polylogarithm, ζ is the riemann zeta function, and "t" is the critical temperature at which a bose–einstein condensate begins to form.
the equation of state from jones–wilkins–lee is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.
the ratio formula_147 is defined by using formula_148 = density of the explosive (solid part) and formula_149 = density of the detonation products. the parameters formula_150, formula_151, formula_152, formula_153 and formula_154 are given by several references. in addition, the initial density (solid part) formula_155, speed of detonation formula_156, chapman–jouguet pressure formula_157 and the chemical energy of the explosive formula_158 are given in such references. these parameters are obtained by fitting the jwl-eos to experimental results. typical parameters for some explosives are listed in the table below.

ecclesiastes (; , "qōheleṯ", greek: ἐκκλησιαστής, "ekklēsiastēs") is one of 24 books of the tanakh or hebrew bible, where it is classified as one of the "ketuvim" (or "writings"). originally written c. 450–200 bce, it is also among the canonical wisdom books in the old testament of most denominations of christianity. the title "ecclesiastes" is a latin transliteration of the greek translation of the hebrew kohelet, the pseudonym used by the author of the book.
in traditional jewish texts and throughout church history (up to the 18th and 19th centuries), king solomon is named as the author, but modern scholars reject this. textually, the book is the musings of a king of jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. the author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the bible, introduces a "kohelet" whom he identifies as the son of david (1:1). the author does not use his own "voice" throughout the book again until the final verses (12:9–14), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what "the kohelet" has spoken. it emphatically proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently "hevel," a word meaning "vain", "futile", […] as the lives of both wise and foolish men end in death. while qoheleth clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he is unable to ascribe eternal meaning to it. in light of this perceived senselessness, he suggests that one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of god. the book concludes with the injunction: "fear god, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone" (12:13).
ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on western literature. it contains several phrases that have resonated in british and american culture, and was quoted by abraham lincoln addressing congress in 1862. american novelist thomas wolfe wrote:
ecclesiastes is presented as biography of "kohelet" (or "qoheleth", meaning "assembler", but traditionally translated by christians as "teacher" or "preacher"). kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. his journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. the reader is not only to hear kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.
few of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:
verse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as "the words of kohelet, son of david, king in jerusalem."
most, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9–14) as an addition by a later scribe. some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of god's justice and the need for piety).
the ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2–11 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow: kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.
after the introduction come the words of kohelet. as king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. death levels all. the only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of god. everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to god's eternal character. the world is filled with injustice, which only god will adjudicate. god and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before god. people should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. the world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.
the frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. the original ending of the book was probably the words: "the end of the matter" (12:13) but the text we have continues: "fear god" (a phrase used often in kohelet's speech) "and keep his commandments" (which he never uses), "for god will bring every deed to judgement."
the book takes its name from the greek "ekklesiastes", a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: "kohelet", meaning something like "one who convenes or addresses an assembly". according to rabbinic tradition, ecclesiastes was written by solomon in his old age (an alternative tradition that "hezekiah and his colleagues wrote isaiah, proverbs, the song of songs and ecclesiastes" probably means simply that the book was edited under hezekiah), but critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin. the presence of persian loan-words and aramaisms points to a date no earlier than about 450 bce, while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 bce, when the jewish writer ben sira quotes from it. the dispute as to whether ecclesiastes belongs to the persian or the hellenistic periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of hellenization (influence of greek culture and thought) present in the book. scholars arguing for a persian date (c. 450–330 bce) hold that there is a complete lack of greek influence; those who argue for a hellenistic date (c. 330–180 bce) argue that it shows internal evidence of greek thought and social setting.
also unresolved is whether the author and narrator of kohelet are one and the same person. ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of kohelet and first-person reflections on kohelet's words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on kohelet's parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of uncle remus, although the description of the kohelet in 12:8–14 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator. the question, however, has no theological importance, and one scholar (roland murphy) has commented that kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as "one more example of the futility of human effort".
ecclesiastes has taken its literary form from the middle eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations. it belongs to the category of wisdom literature, the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings—other examples include the book of job, proverbs, and some of the psalms. ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of wisdom itself. ecclesiastes in turn influenced the deuterocanonical works, wisdom of solomon and sirach, both of which contain vocal rejections of the ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.
wisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into hebrew and influenced the book of proverbs, and the author of ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from egypt and mesopotamia. he may also have been influenced by greek philosophy, specifically the schools of stoicism, which held that all things are fated, and epicureanism, which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.
the presence of ecclesiastes in the bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the hebrew canon—a god who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people—are absent from it, which suggests that kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical council of jamnia in the 1st century ce). one argument advanced then was that the name of solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than ecclesiastes. another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear god and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book that would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. a modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the book of job. yet another suggestion is that ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of god. "in short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company," summarizes martin a. shields in his 2006 book "the end of wisdom: a reappraisal of the historical and canonical function of ecclesiastes"
scholars disagree about the themes of ecclesiastes: whether it is positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic; whether it is coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox; whether the ultimate message of the book to copy kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors. at times kohelet raises deep questions; he "doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals." some passages of ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the old testament, and even itself. one suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., "the dead are better off than the living" (4:2) vs. "a living dog is better off than a dead lion" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11–12:7). on this reading, kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.
the subjects of ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. the phrase "under the sun" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in god, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign. history and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent ("fear god"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy god's gifts.
in judaism, ecclesiastes is read either on shemini atzeret (by yemenites, italians, some sepharadim, and the mediaeval french jewish rite) or on the shabbat of the intermediate days of sukkot (by ashkenazim). if there is no intermediate sabbath of sukkot, even the ashkenazim read it on shemini atzeret (or, for ashkenazim in the land of israel, on the first shabbat of sukkot). it is read on sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without god, life is meaningless. when the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.
the final poem of kohelet () has been interpreted in the targum, talmud and midrash, and by the rabbis rashi, rashbam and ibn ezra, as an allegory of old age.
ecclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current catholic church leaders. for example, doctors of the church have cited ecclesiastes. st. augustine of hippo cited ecclesiastes in book xx of "city of god". saint jerome wrote a commentary on ecclesiastes. st. thomas aquinas cited ecclesiastes ("the number of fools is infinite.") in his "summa theologica".
the twentieth-century catholic theologian and cardinal-elect hans urs von balthasar discusses ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, "the glory of the lord". he describes qoheleth as "a critical transcendentalist "avant la lettre"", whose god is distant from the world, and whose "kairos" is a "form of time which is itself empty of meaning". for balthasar, the role of ecclesiastes in the biblical canon is to represent the "final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the old testament that paves the way for the advent of the new.
the book continues to be cited by recent popes, including pope john paul ii and pope francis. pope john paul ii, in his general audience of october 20, 2004, called the author of ecclesiastes "an ancient biblical sage" whose description of death "makes frantic clinging to earthly things completely pointless." pope francis cited ecclesiastes on his address on september 9, 2014. speaking of vain people, he said, "how many christians live for appearances? their life seems like a soap bubble."
ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on western literature. it contains several phrases that have resonated in british and american culture, such as "eat, drink and be merry," "nothing new under the sun," "a time to be born and a time to die," and "vanity of vanities; all is vanity." american novelist thomas wolfe wrote: "[o]f all i have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. i am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if i had to make one i could say that ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing i have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."

ezekiel (; "y'ḥezqēl" ) is the central protagonist of the book of ezekiel in the hebrew bible.
in judaism, christianity, and islam, ezekiel is acknowledged as a hebrew prophet. in judaism and christianity, he is also viewed as the 6th-century bce author of the book of ezekiel, which reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of jerusalem, the restoration to the land of israel, and what some call the "millennial temple" (or third temple) visions.
the name ezekiel means 'god's strength'.
the author of the book of ezekiel presents himself as ezekiel, the son of buzzi, born into a priestly (kohen) lineage. apart from identifying himself, the author gives a date for the first divine encounter which he presents: "in the thirtieth year". if this is a reference to ezekiel's age at the time, he was born around 622 bce, about the time of josiah's reforms. his "thirtieth year" is given as five years after the exile of judah's king jehoiachin by the babylonians. josephus claims that nebuchadnezzar of babylonia's armies exiled three thousand jews from judah, after deposing king jehoiakim in 598 bce.
according to the bible, ezekiel and his wife lived during the babylonian captivity on the banks of the chebar river, in tel abib, with other exiles from judah. there is no mention of him having any offspring.
ezekiel describes his calling to be a prophet by going into great detail about his encounter with god and four "living creatures" with four wheels that stayed beside the creatures. for the next five years he incessantly prophesied and acted out the destruction of jerusalem and its temple, which was met with some opposition. however, ezekiel and his contemporaries like jeremiah, another prophet who was living in jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies with the siege of jerusalem by the babylonians. on the hypothesis that the "thirtieth year" of refers to ezekiel's age, ezekiel was fifty years old when he had his final vision. on the basis of dates given in the book of ezekiel, ezekiel's span of prophecies can be calculated to have occurred over the course of about 22 years. the last dated words of ezekiel date to april 570 bce.
ezekiel, like jeremiah, is said by talmud and midrash to have been a descendant of joshua by his marriage with the proselyte and former prostitute rahab. some statements found in rabbinic literature posit that ezekiel was the son of jeremiah, who was (also) called "buzi" because he was despised by the jews.
ezekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the land of israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to babylon.
rava states in the babylonian talmud that although ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of god (merkabah), this is not because he had seen more than the prophet isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar. ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.
according to the midrash "canticles rabbah", it was ezekiel whom the three pious men, hananiah, mishael, and azariah (also called shadrach, meshach, and abednego in the bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his idol. at first god revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the "remnant of judah". but after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to god, ezekiel received this revelation: "thou dost believe indeed that i will abandon them. that shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing".
ezekiel is commemorated as a saint in the liturgical calendar of the eastern orthodox church—and those eastern catholic churches which follow the byzantine rite—on july 23 (for those churches which use the traditional julian calendar, july 23 falls on august 5 of the modern gregorian calendar). ezekiel is commemorated on august 28 on the calendar of saints of the armenian apostolic church, and on april 10 in the roman martyrology.
certain lutheran churches also celebrate his commemoration on july 20.
saint bonaventure interpreted ezekiel's statement about the "closed gate" as a prophecy of the incarnation: the "gate" signifying the virgin mary and the "prince" referring to jesus. this is one of the readings at vespers on great feasts of the theotokos in the eastern orthodox and byzantine catholic churches. this imagery is also found in the traditional catholic christmas hymn "gaudete" and in a saying by bonaventure, quoted by alphonsus maria de' liguori: "no one can enter heaven unless by mary, as though through a door." the imagery provides the basis for the concept that god gave mary to humanity as the "gate of heaven" (thence the dedication of churches and convents to the porta coeli), an idea also laid out in the "salve regina" (hail holy queen) prayer.
the story of gog and magog is mentioned in the 18th surah of the quran, al kahf.
ezekiel is recognized as a prophet in islamic tradition. although not mentioned in the qur'an by the name, muslim scholars, both classical and modern have included ezekiel in lists of the prophets of islam.
the qur'an mentions a prophet called zul-kifl. this prophet is sometimes identified with ezekiel although zul-kifl's identity is disputed. carsten niebuhr, in his "reisebeschreibung nach arabian", says he visited al kifl in iraq, midway between najaf and hilla and said "kifl" was the arabic form of "ezekiel". he further explained in his book that ezekiel's tomb was present in al kifl and that the jews came to it on pilgrimage. the name "zul-kifl" or more correctly "dhū l-kifl" () would mean "possessor of the double" or "possesor of the fold" ( "dhū" "possessor of, owner of" and "al-kifl" "double, folded"). some islamic scholars have likened ezekiel's mission to the description of dhul-kifl. when the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, a political and national life was no longer possible. in the absence of a worldly foundation it became necessary to build a spiritual one and ezekiel performed this mission by observing the signs of the time and deducing his doctrines from them. in conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike twofold. aside from the possible identification of zul-kifl with ezekiel, muslims have viewed ezekiel as a prophet, regardless of his identification with zul-kifl.
ezekiel appears in all muslim collections of "stories of the prophets". muslim exegesis further lists ezekiel's father as buzi ("budhi") and ezekiel is given the title "ibn al-adjus", denoting "son of the old (man)", as his parents are supposed to have been very old when he was born. a tradition, which resembles that of hannah and samuel in the hebrew bible, states that ezekiel's mother prayed to god in old age for the birth of an offspring and was given ezekiel as a gift from god.
the tomb of ezekiel is a structure located in modern-day south iraq near kefil, believed to be the final resting place of ezekiel. it has been a place of pilgrimage to both muslims and jews alike. after the jewish exodus from iraq, jewish activity in the tomb ceased, although a disused synagogue remains in place.

in computing, the executable and linkable format (elf, formerly named extensible linking format), is a common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. first published in the specification for the application binary interface (abi) of the unix operating system version named system v release 4 (svr4), and later in the tool interface standard, it was quickly accepted among different vendors of unix systems. in 1999, it was chosen as the standard binary file format for unix and unix-like systems on x86 processors by the 86open project.
by design, the elf format is flexible, extensible, and cross-platform. for instance it supports different endiannesses and address sizes so it does not exclude any particular central processing unit (cpu) or instruction set architecture. this has allowed it to be adopted by many different operating systems on many different hardware platforms.
each elf file is made up of one elf header, followed by file data. the data can include:
the segments contain information that is needed for run time execution of the file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. any byte in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and orphan bytes can occur which are unowned by any section.
the elf header defines whether to use 32- or 64-bit addresses. the header contains three fields that are affected by this setting and offset other fields that follow them. the elf header is 52 or 64 bytes long for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries respectively.
the program header table tells the system how to create a process image. it is found at file offset e_phoff, and consists of e_phnum entries, each with size e_phentsize. the layout is slightly different in 32-bit elf vs 64-bit elf, because the p_flags are in a different structure location for alignment reasons. each entry is structured as:
the elf format has replaced older executable formats in various environments.
it has replaced a.out and coff formats in unix-like operating systems:
elf has also seen some adoption in non-unix operating systems, such as:
some game consoles also use elf:
other (operating) systems running on powerpc that use elf:
some operating systems for mobile phones and mobile devices use elf:
some phones can run elf files through the use of a patch that adds assembly code to the main firmware, which is a feature known as "elfpack" in the underground modding culture. the elf file format is also used with the atmel avr (8-bit), avr32
and with texas instruments msp430 microcontroller architectures. some implementations of open firmware can also load elf files, most notably apple's implementation used in almost all powerpc machines the company produced.
the linux standard base (lsb) supplements some of the above specifications for architectures in which it is specified. for example, that is the case for the system v abi, amd64 supplement.
86open was a project to form consensus on a common binary file format for unix and unix-like operating systems on the common pc compatible x86 architecture, to encourage software developers to port to the architecture. the initial idea was to standardize on a small subset of spec 1170, a predecessor of the single unix specification, and the gnu c library (glibc) to enable unmodified binaries to run on the x86 unix-like operating systems. the project was originally designated "spec 150".
the format eventually chosen was elf, specifically the linux implementation of elf, after it had turned out to be a "de facto" standard supported by all involved vendors and operating systems.
the group began email discussions in 1997 and first met together at the santa cruz operation offices on august 22, 1997.
the steering committee was marc ewing, dion johnson, evan leibovitch, bruce perens, andrew roach, bryan wayne sparks and linus torvalds. other people on the project were keith bostic, chuck cranor, michael davidson, chris g. demetriou, ulrich drepper, don dugger, steve ginzburg, jon "maddog" hall, ron holt, jordan hubbard, dave jensen, kean johnston, andrew josey, robert lipe, bela lubkin, tim marsland, greg page, ronald joe record, tim ruckle, joel silverstein, chia-pi tien, and erik troan. operating systems and companies represented were beos, bsdi, freebsd, intel, linux, netbsd, sco and sunsoft.
the project progressed and in mid-1998, sco began developing lxrun, an open-source compatibility layer able to run linux binaries on openserver, unixware, and solaris. sco announced official support of lxrun at linuxworld in march 1999. sun microsystems began officially supporting lxrun for solaris in early 1999, and later moved to integrated support of the linux binary format via solaris containers for linux applications.
with the bsds having long supported linux binaries (through a compatibility layer) and the main x86 unix vendors having added support for the format, the project decided that linux elf was the format chosen by the industry and "declare[d] itself dissolved" on july 25, 1999.
fatelf is an elf binary-format extension that adds fat binary capabilities. it is aimed for linux and other unix-like operating systems. additionally to the cpu architecture abstraction (byte order, word size, cpu instruction set etc.), there is the potential advantage of software-platform abstraction e.g., binaries which support multiple kernel abi versions. as of 2014, support for fatelf is not integrated in the linux kernel mainline.

the explorers program is a united states space exploration program that provides flight opportunities for physics, geophysics, heliophysics, and astrophysics investigations from space. launched in 1958, explorer 1 was usa's first spacecraft to achieve orbit. over
90 space missions have been launched since. starting with explorer 6, it has been operated by nasa, with regular collaboration with a variety of other institutions, including many international partners.
launchers for the explorer program have included jupiter c (juno i), juno ii, various thor, scout, delta and pegasus rockets, and falcon 9.
currently, the program is divided into "midex", "smex", and "unex", with select "missions of opportunity" operated with other agencies.
the explorers program was the united states's first successful attempt to launch an artificial satellite. it began as a u.s. army proposal (project orbiter) to place a, "civilian", scientific satellite into orbit during the international geophysical year; however, that proposal was rejected in favor of the u.s. navy's project vanguard, which included the first sub-orbital flight vanguard tv0. in december 1956. the explorers program was later reestablished to catch up with the soviet union its launch of sputnik 1 on october 4, 1957 sparked the sputnik crisis. explorer 1 was launched on january 31, 1958, becoming the first u.s. satellite, as well as discovering the van allen radiation belt.
after nasa was established in 1958, the explorers program was transferred from the us army. nasa continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions, typically an artificial satellite with a specific science focus. explorer 6 in 1959 was the first scientific satellite under the project direction of nasa's goddard space flight center. over the following two decades, nasa has launched over 50 explorer missions, some in conjunction to military programs, usually of an exploratory or survey nature or had specific objectives not requiring the capabilities of a major observatory. explorers satellites have made many important discoveries on: earth's magnetosphere and the shape of its gravity field; the solar wind; properties of micrometeoroids raining down on the earth; ultraviolet, cosmic, and x-rays from the solar system and universe beyond; ionospheric physics; solar plasma; solar energetic particles; and atmospheric physics. these missions have also investigated air density, radio astronomy, geodesy, and gamma ray astronomy.
with drops in nasa's budget, explorer missions became infrequent in early 1980s. in 1988, the small explorer (smex) program was established with a focus on frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive space science missions in the disciplines of astrophysics and space physics. the first three smex missions were chosen in april 1989 out of 51 candidates, and launched in 1992, 1996 and 1998. the second set of two missions were announced in september 1994 and launched in 1998 and 1999.
by mid 1990s, nasa initiated the medium-class explorer (midex) program to enable more frequent flights. these were larger than smex missions but smaller and less expensive than "delta-class missions", and were to be launched aboard a new med-lite class launch vehicle. this new launch vehicle was not developed and instead, these missions were flown on a modified delta ii rocket. the first announcement opportunity for midex was issued in march 1995, and the first launch under this new program was fuse in 1999.
in may 1994 nasa also started a new, student explorer demonstration initiative (stedi) pilot program, to demonstrate that high-quality space science can be carried out with small, low-cost missions. of the three selected missions, only, snoe was launched in 1998 and terriers in 1999, but the latter failed after launch. the stedi program was terminated in 2001. later, nasa established the university-class explorers (unex) program for much cheaper missions, and is regarded as a successor to stedi.
the explorer missions were at first managed by the small explorer project office at nasa's goddard space flight center (gsfc). in early 1999, that office was closed and with the announcement of opportunity for the third set of smex missions nasa converted the smex program so that each mission was managed by its principal investigator, with oversight by the gsfc explorers project. the explorers program office at goddard space flight center in greenbelt, maryland, provides management of the many operational scientific exploration missions that are characterized by relatively moderate costs and small to medium-sized missions that are capable of being built, tested, and launched in a short time interval compared to larger observatories like nasa's great observatories.
excluding the launches, the midex program has a current mission cap cost of in 2018, with future midex missions being capped at $350 million. the cost cap for smex missions in 2017 was $165 million. unex missions are capped at $15 million. a subprogram called missions of opportunity (mo) has funded science instruments or hardware components of onboard non-nasa space missions, and have a total nasa cost cap of $70 million.
the selection of the next mo includes the compton spectrometer and imager explorer balloon, transient astrophysics observer on the iss, and contribution to ariel spectroscopy of exoplanets (case) in conjunction with esa.
explorers name numbers can be found in the nssdc master catalog, typically assigned to each spacecraft in a mission. these numbers were not officially assigned until after 1975.
many missions are proposed, but not selected. for example, in 2011, the explorers program received 22 full missions solicitations, 20 missions of opportunity, and 8 uspi. sometimes mission are only partially developed but must be stopped for financial, technological, or bureaucratic reasons. some missions failed upon reaching orbit including wire and terriers.

an electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. oscillators convert direct current (dc) from a power supply to an alternating current (ac) signal. they are widely used in many electronic devices ranging from simplest clock generators to digital instruments (like calculators) and complex computers and peripherals etc. common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.
oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:
oscillators designed to produce a high-power ac output from a dc supply are usually called inverters.
there are two main types of electronic oscillator – the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator.
the harmonic, or "linear", oscillator produces a sinusoidal output. there are two types:
the most common form of linear oscillator is an electronic amplifier such as a transistor or operational amplifier connected in a feedback loop with its output fed back into its input through a frequency selective electronic filter to provide positive feedback. when the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, electronic noise in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. the noise travels around the loop and is amplified and filtered until very quickly it converges on a sine wave at a single frequency.
feedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:
in addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use two-port amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using one-port (two terminal) devices with negative resistance, such as magnetron tubes, tunnel diodes, impatt diodes and gunn diodes. negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the microwave range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.
in negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an lc circuit, crystal, or cavity resonator, is connected across a device with negative differential resistance, and a dc bias voltage is applied to supply energy. a resonant circuit by itself is "almost" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are damped and decay to zero. the negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its resonant frequency.
the negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with two-port amplifying devices such as transistors and tubes also have negative resistance. at high frequencies, transistors and fets do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate. so high-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.
some of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:
a nonlinear or relaxation oscillator produces a non-sinusoidal output, such as a square, sawtooth or triangle wave. it consists of an energy-storing element (a capacitor or, more rarely, an inductor) and a nonlinear switching device (a latch, schmitt trigger, or negative-resistance element) connected in a feedback loop. the switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.
square-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the clock signal for sequential logic circuits such as timers and counters, although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for cathode ray tubes in analogue oscilloscopes and television sets. they are also used in voltage-controlled oscillators (vcos), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters (adcs), and in function generators to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. in general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.
ring oscillators are built of a ring of active delay stages. generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.
some of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:
an oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. these voltage controlled oscillators are widely used in phase-locked loops, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. these are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in filters, modulators, demodulators, and forming the basis of frequency synthesizer circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.
radio frequency vcos are usually made by adding a varactor diode to the tuned circuit or resonator in an oscillator circuit. changing the dc voltage across the varactor changes its capacitance, which changes the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit. voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled current source. increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.
the first practical oscillators were based on electric arcs, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. the current through an arc light is unstable due to its negative resistance, and often breaks into spontaneous oscillations, causing the arc to make hissing, humming or howling sounds which had been noticed by humphry davy in 1821, benjamin silliman in 1822, auguste arthur de la rive in 1846, and david edward hughes in 1878. ernst lecher in 1888 showed that the current through an electric arc could be oscillatory. an oscillator was built by elihu thomson in 1892 by placing an lc tuned circuit in parallel with an electric arc and included a magnetic blowout. independently, in the same year, george francis fitzgerald realized that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, the circuit would produce oscillations, and, unsuccessfully, tried to build a negative resistance oscillator with a dynamo, what would now be called a parametric oscillator. the arc oscillator was rediscovered and popularized by william duddell in 1900. duddell, a student at london technical college, was investigating the hissing arc effect. he attached an lc circuit (tuned circuit) to the electrodes of an arc lamp, and the negative resistance of the arc excited oscillation in the tuned circuit. some of the energy was radiated as sound waves by the arc, producing a musical tone. duddell demonstrated his oscillator before the london institute of electrical engineers by sequentially connecting different tuned circuits across the arc to play the national anthem "god save the queen". duddell's "singing arc" did not generate frequencies above the audio range. in 1902 danish physicists valdemar poulsen and p. o. pederson were able to increase the frequency produced into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere with a magnetic field, inventing the poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first continuous wave radio transmitter, which was used through the 1920s.
the vacuum-tube feedback oscillator was invented around 1912, when it was discovered that feedback ("regeneration") in the recently invented audion vacuum tube could produce oscillations. at least six researchers independently made this discovery, although not all of them can be said to have a role in the invention of the oscillator. in the summer of 1912, edwin armstrong observed oscillations in audion radio receiver circuits and went on to use positive feedback in his invention of the regenerative receiver. austrian alexander meissner independently discovered positive feedback and invented oscillators in march 1913. irving langmuir at general electric observed feedback in 1913. fritz lowenstein may have preceded the others with a crude oscillator in late 1911. in britain, h. j. round patented amplifying and oscillating circuits in 1913. in august 1912, lee de forest, the inventor of the audion, had also observed oscillations in his amplifiers, but he didn't understand its significance and tried to eliminate it until he read armstrong's patents in 1914, which he promptly challenged. armstrong and de forest fought a protracted legal battle over the rights to the "regenerative" oscillator circuit which has been called "the most complicated patent litigation in the history of radio". de forest ultimately won before the supreme court in 1934 on technical grounds, but most sources regard armstrong's claim as the stronger one.
the first and most widely used relaxation oscillator circuit, the astable multivibrator, was invented in 1917 by french engineers henri abraham and eugene bloch. they called their cross-coupled, dual-vacuum-tube circuit a "multivibrateur", because the square-wave signal it produced was rich in harmonics, compared to the sinusoidal signal of other vacuum-tube oscillators.
vacuum-tube feedback oscillators became the basis of radio transmission by 1920. however, the triode vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300 mhz because of interelectrode capacitance. to reach higher frequencies, new "transit time" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in "bunches" through the tube. the first of these was the barkhausen–kurz oscillator (1920), the first tube to produce power in the uhf range. the most important and widely used were the klystron (r. and s. varian, 1937) and the cavity magnetron (j. randall and h. boot, 1940).
mathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the barkhausen criterion, were derived by heinrich georg barkhausen in 1921. the first analysis of a nonlinear electronic oscillator model, the van der pol oscillator, was done by balthasar van der pol in 1927. he showed that the stability of the oscillations (limit cycles) in actual oscillators was due to the nonlinearity of the amplifying device. he originated the term "relaxation oscillation" and was first to distinguish between linear and relaxation oscillators. further advances in mathematical analysis of oscillation were made by hendrik wade bode and harry nyquist in the 1930s. in 1969 k. kurokawa derived necessary and sufficient conditions for oscillation in negative-resistance circuits, which form the basis of modern microwave oscillator design.

a societas europaea (se; ; latin for "european society" or "company"; plural: societates europaeae) is a public company registered in accordance with the corporate law of the european union (eu), introduced in 2004 with the council regulation on the statute for a european company. such a company may more easily transfer to or merge with companies in other member states.
as of april 2018, more than 3,000 registrations have been reported, including the following nine components (18%) of the euro stoxx 50 stock market index of leading eurozone companies (excluding the se designation): airbus, allianz, basf, e.on, fresenius, lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton, sap, schneider electric and unibail-rodamco.
national law continues to supplement the basic rules in the regulation on formation and mergers. the european company regulation is complemented by an employee involvement directive that sets rules for participation by employees on the company's board of directors. there is also a statute allowing european cooperative societies.
the statute provides four ways of forming a european limited company:
formation by merger is available only to public limited companies from different member states. formation of an se holding company is available to public and private limited companies with their registered offices in different member states or having subsidiaries or branches in member states other than that of their registered office. formation of a joint subsidiary is available under the same circumstances to any legal entities governed by public or private law.
the se must have a minimum subscribed capital of €120,000 as per article 4(2) of the directive, subject to the provision that where a member state requires a larger capital for companies exercising certain types of activities, the same requirement will also apply to an se with its registered office in that member state (article 4(3)).
the registered office of the se designated in the statutes must be the place where it has its central administration, that is to say its true centre of operations. the se may transfer its registered office within the european economic area without dissolving the company in one member state in order to form a new one in another member state; however, such a transfer is subject to the provisions of 8 which require, inter alia, the drawing up of a transfer proposal, a report justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer and the issuing, by the competent authority in the member state in which the se is registered, of a certificate attesting to the completion of the required acts and formalities.
the order of precedence of the laws applicable to the se is clarified.
the registration and completion of the liquidation of an se must be disclosed for information purposes in the official journal of the european communities. every se must be registered in the state where it has its registered office, in a register designated by the law of that state.
the statutes of the se must provide as governing bodies the general meeting of shareholders and either a management board and a supervisory board (two-tier system) or an administrative board (single-tier system).
under the two-tier system the se is managed by a management board. the member or members of the management board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. they are appointed and removed by the supervisory board. no person may be a member of both the management board and the supervisory board of the same company at the same time. but the supervisory board may appoint one of its members to exercise the functions of a member of the management board in the event of absence through holidays. during such a period the function of the person concerned as a member of the supervisory board shall be suspended.
under the single-tier system, the se is managed by an administrative board. the member or members of the administrative board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. under the single-tier system the administrative board may delegate the power of management to one or more of its members.
the following operations require the authorization of the supervisory board or the deliberation of the administrative board:
the se must draw up annual accounts comprising the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, and the notes to the accounts, and an annual report giving a fair view of the company's business and of its position; consolidated accounts may also be required.
in tax matters, the se is treated the same as any other multinational, i.e., it is subject to the tax regime of the national legislation applicable to the company and its subsidiaries. ses are subject to taxes and charges in all member states where their administrative centres are situated. thus, their tax status is not perfect as there is still no adequate harmonization at european level.
winding-up, liquidation, insolvency, and suspension of payments are in large measure to be governed by national law. when an se transfers its registered office outside the community, or in any other manner no longer complies with requirements of article 7, the member state must take appropriate measures to ensure compliance or take necessary measures to ensure that the se is liquidated.
council regulation (ec) no 2157/2001 of 8 october 2001 on the statute for a european company (se).
council directive 2001/86/ec of 8 october 2001 supplementing the statute for a european company with regard to the involvement of employees.
see also: europa's collection of press releases, regulations, directives and faqs on the european company statute.
uk statutory instrument 2004 no. 2326. the european public limited-liability company regulations 2004 came into force on 8 october and gave effect to the european company statute regulation (council regulation ec no.2157/2001), which gives the framework for a new form of company, the european public limited-liability company or societas europaea (se). the regulations are available in full text on the hmso website.
uk statutory instrument 2004 no. 2407. the european public limited-liability company (fees) regulations 2004 also came into force on 8 october 2004. an explanatory memorandum on the fees regulations describe them as setting out "the fees payable in connection with the services and facilities provided by the dti in respect of a new form of company, the european public limited-liability company or 'societas europaea' (se)."
the regulation is complemented by the council directive supplementing the statute for a european company with regard to the involvement of employees (informally "council directive on employee participation"), adopted 8 october 2001. the directive establishes rules on worker involvement in the management of the se.
eu member states differ in the degree of worker involvement in corporate management. in germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the supervisory board. other member states, such as the uk, have no such requirement, and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management.
these differing traditions of worker involvement have held back the adoption of the statute for over a decade. states without worker involvement provisions were afraid that the se might lead to having such provisions being imposed on their companies; and states with those provisions were afraid they might lead to those provisions being circumvented.
a compromise, contained in the directive, was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the se will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before the creation of the se. if agreement cannot be reached, provisions contained in the directive will apply. the directive provides for worker involvement in the se if a minimum percentage of employees from the entities coming together to form the se enjoyed worker involvement provisions. the directive permits member states to not implement these default worker involvement provisions in their national law, but then an se cannot be created in that member state if the provisions in the directive would apply and negotiations between workers and management are unsuccessful.
definition of employee participation: it does not mean participation in day-to-day decisions, which are a matter for the management, but participation in the supervision and strategic development of the company.
employment contracts and pensions are not covered by the directive. with regard to occupational pension schemes, the se is covered by the provisions laid down in the proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational schemes, presented by the commission in october 2000, in particular in connection with the possibility of introducing a single pension scheme for all their employees in the european union.
two approaches have been attempted to solve the problems cited above. one approach is to harmonize the company law of the member states. this approach has had some successes, but after thirty years only limited progress has been made. it is difficult to harmonize widely different regulatory systems, especially when they reflect different national attitudes to issues such as worker involvement in the management of the company.
the other approach is to construct a whole new system of eu company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the eu-wide system. however, this approach has been only somewhat more effective than the harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the eu-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so that they will not be put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.
the european company statute represents a step in this direction, albeit a limited one. while it establishes some common eu rules on the se, these rules are incomplete, and the holes in the rules are to be filled in using the law of the member state in which the se is registered. this has been due to the difficulties of agreeing on common european rules on these issues.
as of 11 april 2018, 3,015 registrations have been made. in terms of registrations, the czech republic is vastly overrepresented, accounting for 79% of all "societates europaeae" as of december 2015. 9 of the 50 constituents of the euro stoxx 50 stock market index of leading eurozone companies are as of december 2015 "societates europaeae".
annual registrations by member state are presented in the following chart:
registrations of new "societates" are to be published in the official journal of the european union. there is no official union-wide register of "societates", as they are registered in the nation in which their corporate seats are located. "worker-participation.eu" does however maintain a database of current and planned registrations. examples of companies include:

an electronic mixer is a device that combines two or more electrical or electronic signals into one or two composite output signals. there are two basic circuits that both use the term "mixer", but they are very different types of circuits: additive mixers and multiplicative mixers. additive mixers are also known as "analog adders" to distinguish from the related digital adder circuits.
simple additive mixers use kirchhoff's circuit laws to add the currents of two or more signals together, and this terminology ("mixer") is only used in the realm of audio electronics where audio mixers are used to add together audio signals such as voice signals, music signals, and sound effects.
multiplicative mixers multiply together two time-varying input signals instantaneously (instant-by-instant). if the two input signals are both sinusoids of specified frequencies f and f, then the output of the mixer will contain two new sinusoids that have the sum f + f frequency and the difference frequency absolute value |f - f|.
any nonlinear electronic block driven by two signals with frequencies f and f would generate intermodulation (mixing) products. a multiplier (which is a nonlinear device) will generate ideally only the sum and difference frequencies, whereas an arbitrary nonlinear block will also generate signals at 2·f-3·f, etc. therefore, normal nonlinear amplifiers or just single diodes have been used as mixers, instead of a more complex multiplier. a multiplier usually has the advantage of rejecting – at least partly – undesired higher-order intermodulations and larger conversion gain.
additive mixers add two or more signals, giving out a composite signal that contains the frequency components of each of the source signals. the simplest additive mixers are resistor networks, and thus purely passive, while more complex matrix mixers employ active components such as buffer amplifiers for impedance matching and better isolation.
an ideal multiplicative mixer produces an output signal equal to the product of the two input signals. in communications, a multiplicative mixer is often used together with an oscillator to modulate signal frequencies. a multiplicative mixer can be coupled with a filter to either up-convert or down-convert an input signal frequency, but they are more commonly used to down-convert to a lower frequency to allow for simpler filter designs, as done in superheterodyne receivers. in many typical circuits, the single output signal actually contains multiple waveforms, namely those at the sum and difference of the two input frequencies and harmonic waveforms. the output signal may be obtained by removing the other signal components with a filter.í
the received signal can be represented as
and that of the local oscillator can be represented as
for simplicity, assume that the output "i" of the detector is proportional to the square of the amplitude:
the output has high frequency (formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11) and constant components. in heterodyne detection, the high frequency components and usually the constant components are filtered out, leaving the intermediate (beat) frequency at formula_12. the amplitude of this last component is proportional to the amplitude of the signal radiation. with appropriate signal analysis the phase of the signal can be recovered as well.
if formula_13 is equal to formula_14 then the beat component is a recovered version of the original signal, with the amplitude equal to the product of formula_15 and formula_16; that is, the received signal is amplified by mixing with the local oscillator. this is the basis for a direct conversion receiver.
multiplicative mixers have been implemented in many ways. the most popular are gilbert cell mixers, diode mixers, diode ring mixers (ring modulation) and switching mixers. diode mixers take advantage of the non-linearity of diode devices to produce the desired multiplication in the squared term. they are very inefficient as most of the power output is in other unwanted terms which need filtering out. inexpensive am radios still use diode mixers.
electronic mixers are usually made with transistors and/or diodes arranged in a balanced circuit or even a double-balanced circuit. they are readily manufactured as monolithic integrated circuits or hybrid integrated circuits. they are designed for a wide variety of frequency ranges, and they are mass-produced to tight tolerances by the hundreds of thousands, making them relatively cheap.
double-balanced mixers are very widely used in microwave communications, satellite communications, ultrahigh frequency (uhf) communications transmitters, radio receivers, and radar systems.
gilbert cell mixers are an arrangement of transistors that multiplies the two signals.
switching mixers use arrays of field-effect transistors or vacuum tubes. these are used as electronic switches, to alternate the signal direction. they are controlled by the signal being mixed. they are especially popular with digitally controlled radios. switching mixers pass more power and usually insert less distortion than gilbert cell mixers.

eubulides (; fl. 4th century bce) of miletus was a philosopher of the megarian school, and a pupil of euclid of megara. he is famous for his paradoxes.
eubulides was a pupil of euclid of megara, the founder of the megarian school. he was a contemporary of aristotle, against whom he wrote with great bitterness. he taught logic to demosthenes, and he is also said to have taught apollonius cronus, the teacher of diodorus cronus, and the historian euphantus. he may have been the author of a book about diogenes of sinope.
eubulides is most famous for inventing the forms of seven famous paradoxes, some of which, however, are also ascribed to diodorus cronus:
the first paradox (the liar) is probably the most famous, and is similar to the famous paradox of epimenides the cretan. the second, third and fourth paradoxes are variants of a single paradox and relate to the problem of what it means to "know" something and the identity of objects involved in an affirmation (compare the masked man fallacy). the fifth and sixth paradoxes are also a single paradox and is usually thought to relate to the vagueness of language. the final paradox attacks presumptions involved in a proposition, and is related to the syllogistic fallacy.
these paradoxes were very well known in ancient times, some are alluded to by eubulides' contemporary aristotle and even partially by plato. aulus gellius mentions how the discussion of such paradoxes was considered (for him) after-dinner entertainment at the saturnalia, but seneca, on the other hand, considered them a waste of time: "not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does no good."

eta (; ), an acronym for euskadi ta askatasuna (; "basque homeland and liberty" or "basque country and freedom") was an armed leftist basque nationalist and separatist organization in the basque country (in northern spain and southwestern france). the group was founded in 1959 and later evolved from a group promoting traditional basque culture to a paramilitary group engaged in a violent campaign of bombing, assassinations and kidnappings in the southern basque country and throughout spanish territory. its goal was gaining independence for the basque country. eta was the main group within the basque national liberation movement and was the most important basque participant in the basque conflict.
between 1968 and 2010, it killed 829 people (including 340 civilians) and injured thousands more. eta was classified as a terrorist group by spain, france, the united kingdom, the united states, canada and the european union. this convention was followed by a plurality of domestic and international media, which also referred to the group as "terrorists". there are more than 260 imprisoned former members of the group in spain, france, and other countries.
eta declared ceasefires in 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2006. on 5 september 2010, eta declared a new ceasefire that remained in force, and on 20 october 2011, eta announced a "definitive cessation of its armed activity". on 24 november 2012, it was reported that the group was ready to negotiate a "definitive end" to its operations and disband completely. the group announced on 7 april 2017 that it had given up all its weapons and explosives. on 2 may 2018, eta made public a letter dated to 16 april 2018 according to which it had "completely dissolved all its structures and ended its political initiative".
eta's motto was ("keep up on both"), referring to the two figures in its symbol, a snake (representing politics) wrapped around an axe (representing armed struggle).
eta changed its internal structure on several occasions, commonly for security reasons. the group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. reports from spanish and french police pointed towards significant changes in eta's structures in its later years. eta divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. the change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. eta's intention was to disperse its members and reduce the impact of detentions.
the leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and eta's internal documentation referred to it as zuba, an abbreviation of "zuzendaritza batzordea" (directorial committee). there was another committee named "zuba-hitu" that functioned as an advisory committee. the eleven different substructures were: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.
eta's armed operations were organized in different "taldes" ("groups") or "commandos", generally composed of three to five members, whose objective was to conduct attacks in a specific geographic zone. the "taldes" were coordinated by the "cúpula militar" ("military cupola"). to supply the "taldes", support groups maintained safe houses and "zulos" (small rooms concealed in forests, garrets or underground, used to store arms, explosives or, sometimes, kidnapped people; the basque word "zulo" literally means "hole"). the small cellars used to hide the people kidnapped are named by eta and eta's supporters "people's jails". the most common "commandos" were itinerant, not linked to any specific area, and thus were more difficult to capture.
among its members, eta distinguished between "legales/legalak" ("legal ones"), those members who did not have police records and lived apparently normal lives; "liberados" ("liberated") members known to the police that were on eta's payroll and working full-time for eta; and "apoyos" ("support") who just gave occasional help and logistics support to the group when required.
there were also imprisoned members of the group, serving time scattered across spain and france, that sometimes still have significant influence inside the organisation; and finally the "quemados" ("burnt out"), members freed after having been imprisoned or those that were suspected by the group of being under police vigilance. in the past there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the french government to remote countries where they lived freely. eta's internal bulletin was named "zutabe" ("column"), replacing the earlier one (1962) "zutik" ("standing").
eta also promoted the "kale borroka" ("street fight"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, journalist, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against eta, bank offices, menaces, graffiti of political mottoes, and general rioting, usually using molotov cocktails. these groups were mostly made up of young people, who were directed through youth organisations (such as jarrai, haika and segi). many members of eta started their collaboration with the group as participants in the "kale borroka".
the former political party batasuna, disbanded in 2003, pursued the same political goals as eta and did not condemn eta's use of violence. formerly known as euskal herritarrok and "herri batasuna", it was banned by the spanish supreme court as an anti-democratic organisation following the political parties law ("ley de partidos políticos"), it generally received 10% to 20% of the vote in the basque autonomous community.
batasuna's political status was controversial. it was considered to be the political wing of eta. moreover, after the investigations on the nature of the relationship between batasuna and eta by judge baltasar garzón, who suspended the activities of the political organisation and ordered police to shut down its headquarters, the supreme court of spain finally declared batasuna illegal on 18 march 2003. the court considered proven that batasuna had links with eta and that it constituted in fact part of eta's structure. in 2003, the constitutional tribunal upheld the legality of the law.
however, the party itself denied being the political wing of eta, although double membership – simultaneous or alternative – between batasuna and eta was often recorded, such as with the cases of prominent batasuna leaders like josu ternera, arnaldo otegi, jon salaberria and others.
the spanish cortes (the spanish parliament) began the process of declaring the party illegal in august 2002 by issuing a bill entitled the "ley de partidos políticos" which bars political parties that use violence to achieve political goals, promote hatred against different groups or seek to destroy the democratic system. the bill passed the cortes with a 304 to 16 vote. many within the basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the law, which they considered too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.
defenders of the law argued that the "ley de partidos" did not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. defenders also argued that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the state of law. batasuna had failed to produce such a statement. other political parties linked to organizations such as "partido comunista de españa (reconstituido)" have also been declared illegal, and acción nacionalista vasca and communist party of the basque lands (ehak/pctv, "euskal herrialdeetako alderdi komunista/partido comunista de las tierras vascas") were declared illegal in september 2008.
a new party called aukera guztiak "(all the options)" was formed expressly for the elections to the basque parliament of april 2005. its supporters claimed no heritage from batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. on the matter of political violence, aukera guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the basque national liberation movement (mlnv) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former batasuna supporters or affiliates. the spanish supreme court unanimously considered the party to be a successor to batasuna and declared a ban on it.
after aukera guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from herri batasuna, the communist party of the basque lands (ehak/pctv, "euskal herrialdeetako alderdi komunista/partido comunista de las tierras vascas"), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the autonomous basque parliament. ehak made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned aukera guztiak platform.
this move left no time for the spanish courts to investigate ehak in compliance with the "ley de partidos" before the elections were held. the bulk of batasuna supporters voted in this election for pctv. it obtained 9 seats of 75 (12.44% of votes) in the basque parliament.
the election of ehak representatives eventually allowed the programme of the now-illegal batasuna to continue being represented without having condemned violence as required by the "ley de partidos".
in february 2011, sortu, a party described as "the new batasuna", was launched. unlike predecessor parties, sortu explicitly rejects politically motivated violence, including that of eta. however, on 23 march 2011, the spanish supreme court banned sortu from registering as a political party on the grounds that it was linked to eta.
the spanish transition to democracy from 1975 on and eta's progressive radicalisation have resulted in a steady loss of support, which became especially apparent at the time of their 1997 kidnapping and countdown assassination of miguel ángel blanco. their loss of sympathisers has been reflected in an erosion of support for the political parties identified with them. in the 1998 basque parliament elections euskal herritarrok, formerly batasuna, polled 17.7% of the votes. however, by 2001 the party's support had fallen to 10.0%. there were also concerns that spain's "judicial offensive" against alleged eta supporters (two basque political parties and one ngo were banned in september 2008) constitute a threat to human rights. strong evidence was seen that a legal network had grown so wide as to lead to the arrest of numerous innocent people. according to amnesty international, torture was still "persistent", though not "systematic." inroads could be undermined by judicial short-cuts and abuses of human rights.
the euskobarometro, the survey carried out by the universidad del país vasco (university of the basque country), asking about the views of eta within the basque population, obtained these results in may 2009: 64% rejected eta totally, 13% identified themselves as former eta sympathisers who no longer support the group. another 10% agreed with eta's ends, but not their means. 3% said that their attitude towards eta was mainly one of fear, 3% expressed indifference and 3% were undecided or did not answer. about 3% gave eta "justified, with criticism" support (supporting the group but criticising some of their actions) and only 1% gave eta total support. even within batasuna voters, at least 48% rejected eta's violence.
a poll taken by the basque autonomous government in december 2006 during eta's "permanent" ceasefire showed that 88% of the basques thought that it was necessary for all political parties to launch a dialogue, including a debate on the political framework for the basque country (86%). 69% support the idea of ratifying the results of this hypothetical multiparty dialogue through a referendum. this poll also reveals that the hope of a peaceful resolution to the issue of the constitutional status of the basque region has fallen to 78% (from 90% in april).
these polls did not cover navarre, where support for basque nationalist electoral options is weaker (around 25% of population) or the northern basque country where support is even weaker (around 15% of population).
eta grew out of a student group called ekin, founded in the early 1950s, which published a magazine and undertook direct action. eta was founded on 31 july 1959 as euskadi ta askatasuna ("basque homeland and liberty" or "basque country and freedom") by students frustrated by the moderate stance of the basque nationalist party. (originally, the name for the organisation used the word "aberri" instead of "euskadi", creating the acronym "ata". however, in some basque dialects, "ata" means "duck", so the name was changed.)
eta held their first assembly in bayonne, france, in 1962, during which a "declaration of principles" was formulated and following which a structure of activist cells was developed. subsequently, marxist and third-worldist perspectives developed within eta, becoming the basis for a political programme set out in federico krutwig's 1963 book "vasconia", which is considered to be the defining text of the movement. in contrast to previous basque nationalist platforms, krutwig's vision was anti-religious and based upon language and culture rather than race. eta's third and fourth assemblies, held in 1964 and 1965, adopted an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist position, seeing nationalism and the class struggle as intrinsically connected.
some sources attribute the 1960 bombing of the amara station in donostia-san sebastian (which killed a 22-month-old child) to eta, but statistics published by the spanish ministry of the interior have always showed that eta's first victim was killed in 1968. the 1960 attack was claimed by the portuguese and spanish left-wing group dril (together with four other very similar bombings committed that same day across spain, all of them attributed to dril), and the attribution to eta has been considered to be unfounded by the researchers. police documents dating from 1961, released in 2013, show that the dril was indeed the author of the bombing.
eta's first killing occurred on 7 june 1968, when guardia civil member josé pardines arcay was shot dead after he tried to halt eta member txabi etxebarrieta during a routine road check. etxebarrieta was chased down and killed as he tried to flee. this led to retaliation in the form of the first planned eta assassination: that of melitón manzanas, chief of the secret police in san sebastián and associated with a long record of tortures inflicted on detainees in his custody. in december 1970, several members of eta were condemned to death in the "proceso de burgos" ("burgos trial"), but international pressure resulted in their sentences being commuted (a process which, however, had by that time already been applied to some other members of eta).
in early december 1970, eta kidnapped the german consul in san sebastian, eugen beilh, in order to exchange him for the burgos defendants. he was released unharmed on 24 december.
nationalists who refused to follow the tenets of marxism–leninism and who sought to create a united front appeared as eta-v, but lacked the support to challenge eta.
the most significant assassination performed by eta during franco's dictatorship was operación ogro, the december 1973 bomb assassination in madrid of admiral luis carrero blanco, franco's chosen successor and president of the government (a position roughly equivalent to being a prime minister). the assassination had been planned for months and was executed by placing a bomb in a tunnel dug below the street where carrero blanco's car passed every day. the bomb blew up beneath the politician's car and threw it five stories into the air and over the top of a nearby building onto a balcony in a nearby courtyard.
for some in the spanish opposition, carrero blanco's assassination,i.e., the elimination of franco's chosen successor was an instrumental step for the subsequent re-establishment of democracy. the government responded with new anti-terrorist laws which gave police greater powers and empowered military tribunals to pass death sentences against those found guilty. however, the last use of capital punishment in spain when two eta members were executed in september 1975, eight weeks before franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the spanish government.
during the spanish transition to democracy which began following franco's death, eta split into two separate groups: eta political-military or eta(pm), and eta military or eta(m).
both eta(m) and eta(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. the years 1978–80 were to prove eta's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.
during the franco dictatorship, eta was able to take advantage of tolerance by the french government, which allowed its members to move freely through french territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of franco's regime. there is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of "sanctuary" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the french authorities collaborate closely with the spanish government against eta.
in the 1980s, eta(pm) accepted the spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all eta prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. this caused a new division in eta(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. eta vii accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic spanish government and integrated into the political party "euskadiko ezkerra" ("left of the basque country").
eta viii, after a brief period of independent activity, eventually integrated into eta(m). with no factions existing anymore, eta(m) reclaimed the original name of euskadi ta askatasuna.
during the 1980s a "dirty war" ensued by means of the grupos antiterroristas de liberación (gal, "antiterrorist liberation groups"), a paramilitary group which billed themselves as counter-terrorist, active between 1983 and 1987. the gal committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of eta members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with eta. 27 people were killed by gal. gal activities were a follow-up of similar dirty war actions by death squads, actively supported by members of spanish security forces and secret services, using names such as batallón vasco español active from 1975 to 1981. they were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.
one consequence of gal's activities in france was the decision in 1984 by interior minister pierre joxe to permit the extradition of eta suspects to spain. reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing eta's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in france.
the airing of the state-sponsored "dirty war" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for gal in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in spain. the group's connections with the state were unveiled by the spanish journal el mundo, with an investigative series leading to the gal plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. as a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed state terrorism.
in 1997 the spanish audiencia nacional court finished its trial, which resulted in convictions and imprisonment of several individuals related to the gal, including civil servants up to the highest levels of the spanish socialist workers' party (psoe) government, such as former homeland minister josé barrionuevo. premier felipe gonzález was quoted as saying that the constitutional state has to defend itself "also in the sewers" ("el estado de derecho también se defiende en las cloacas") something which, for some, indicated at least his knowledge of the scheme. however, his involvement with the gal could never be proven.
these events marked the end of the armed "counter-terrorist" period in spain and no major cases of foul play on the part of the spanish government after 1987 (when gal ceased to operate) have been proven in courts.
according to the radical nationalist group, euskal memoria, between 1960 and 2010 there were 465 deaths in the basque country due to (primarily spanish) "state violence". this figure is considerably higher than those given elsewhere, which are usually between 250 and 300. critics of eta cite only 56 members of that organisation killed by state forces since 1975.
eta members and supporters routinely claim torture at the hands of spanish police forces. while these claims are hard to verify, some convictions are based on confessions while prisoners are held "incomunicado" and without access to a lawyer of their choice, for a maximum of five days. these confessions are routinely repudiated by the defendants during trials as having been extracted under torture. there have been some successful prosecutions of proven tortures during the "dirty war" period of the mid-1980s, although the penalties have been considered by amnesty international as unjustifiably light and lenient with co-conspirators and enablers.
in this regard, amnesty international has shown concern for the continuous disregard on the recommendations issued by the agency to prevent the alleged abuses to possibly take place. also in this regard, eta's manuals have been found instructing its members and supporters to claim routinely that they had been tortured while detained. unai romano's case has been very controversial. pictures of him with a symmetrically swollen face of uncertain etiology were published after his incommunicado period leading to claims of police abuse and torture. martxelo otamendi, the ex-director of the basque newspaper euskaldunon egunkaria, decided to bring charges in september 2008 against the spanish government in strasbourg court for "not inspecting properly" torture denounced cases.
as a result of eta's violence, threats and killings of journalists, reporters without borders has included spain in all six editions of its annual watchlist on press freedom. thus, this ngo has included eta in its watchlist "predators of press freedom".
eta performed their first car bomb assassination in madrid in september 1985, resulting in one death (american citizen eugene kent brown, johnson & johnson employee) and sixteen injuries; the plaza república dominicana bombing in july 1986 killed 12 members of the guardia civil and injured 50; on 19 june 1987, the hipercor bombing was an attack in a shopping center in barcelona, killing twenty-one and injuring forty-five; in the last case, entire families were killed. the horror caused then was so striking that eta felt compelled to issue a communiqué stating that they had given warning of the hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. the police claim that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.
in 1986 gesto por la paz (known in english as association for peace in the basque country) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the basque country the day after any violent killing, whether by eta or by gal. these were the first systematic demonstrations in the basque country against political violence. also in 1986, in ordizia, eta shot down maría dolores katarain, known as "yoyes", while she was walking with her infant son. yoyes was a former member of eta who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of "desertion" because of her taking advantage of the spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).
on 12 january 1988, all basque political parties except eta-affiliated herri batasuna signed the ajuria-enea pact with the intent of ending eta's violence. weeks later on 28 january, eta announced a 60-day "ceasefire", later prolonged several times. negotiations known as the mesa de argel ("algiers table") took place between the eta representative eugenio etxebeste ("antxon"), and the then psoe government of spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and eta eventually resumed the use of violence.
during this period, the spanish government had a policy referred to as "reinsertion", under which imprisoned eta members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. claiming a need to prevent eta from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the psoe government decided that imprisoned eta members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the basque country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout spain, some as far from their families as in the salto del negro prison in the canary islands. france has taken a similar approach.
in the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan ""euskal presoak – euskal herrira"" ("basque prisoners to the basque country", by "basque prisoners" only eta members are meant). it has to be noted that almost in any spanish jail there is a group of eta prisoners, as the number of eta prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.
"gestoras pro amnistía/amnistiaren aldeko batzordeak" ("pro-amnesty managing assemblies", currently illegal), later "askatasuna" ("freedom") and "senideak" ("the family members") provided support for prisoners and families. the basque government and several nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. the long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by nationalist prisoner's family supporters.
during the eta ceasefire of the late 1990s, the psoe government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in africa. since the end of the ceasefire, eta prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. some basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.
another spanish "counter-terrorist" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal "audiencia nacional" in madrid, due to the threats by the group over the basque courts. under article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held "incommunicado" for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the coroners. in comparison, the habeas corpus term for other suspects is three days.
in 1992, eta's three top leaders—"military" leader francisco mujika garmendia ("pakito"), political leader josé luis alvarez santacristina ("txelis") and logistical leader josé maría arregi erostarbe ("fiti"), often referred to collectively as the "cúpula" of eta or as the artapalo collective—were arrested in the northern basque town of bidart, which led to changes in eta's leadership and direction.
after a two-month truce, eta adopted even more radical positions. the principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the ""y groups"", formed by young militants of eta parallel groups (generally minors), dedicated to so-called ""kale borroka""—street struggle—and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, atms, garbage containers, and throwing molotov cocktails. the appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of eta, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the "cupola". eta also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival basque nationalist parties.
in 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. the so-called "democratic alternative" replaced the earlier kas alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of euskal herria. the democratic alternative offered the cessation of all armed eta activity if the spanish-government would recognize the basque people as having sovereignty over basque territory, the right to self-determination and that it freed all eta members in prison. the spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the spanish constitution of 1978. changing the constitution was not considered.
also in 1995 came a failed eta car bombing attempt directed against josé maría aznar, a conservative politician who was leader of the then-opposition partido popular (pp) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in majorca on the life of king juan carlos i. still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. 10 july 1997, pp council member miguel ángel blanco was kidnapped in the basque town of ermua, with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the spanish government met eta's demand of starting to bring all eta's inmates to prisons of the basque country within two days after the kidnapping.
this demand was not met by the spanish government and after three days miguel ángel blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. more than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the basque regions as elsewhere in spain, chanting cries of "assassins" and "basques yes, eta no". this response came to be known as the "spirit of ermua".
later came acts of violence such as the 6 november 2001 car bomb in madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on football stadiums and tourist destinations throughout spain.
the 11 september 2001 attacks in the usa appeared to have dealt a hard blow to eta, owing to the worldwide toughening of "anti-terrorist" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to eta. in addition, in 2002 the basque nationalist youth movement, "jarrai", was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing herri batasuna, the "political arm" of eta (although even before the change in law, batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge baltasar garzón).
with ever-increasing frequency, attempted eta actions were frustrated by spanish security forces.
on 24 december 2003, in san sebastián and in hernani, national police arrested two eta members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in chamartín station in madrid. on 1 march 2004, in a place between alcalá de henares and madrid, a light truck with 536 kg of explosives was discovered by the guardia civil.
eta was initially blamed for the 2004 madrid bombings by the outgoing government and large sections of the press. however, the group denied responsibility and islamic fundamentalists from morocco were eventually convicted. the judicial investigation currently states that there is no relationship between eta and the madrid bombings.
in the context of negotiation with the spanish government, eta declared what it described as a "truce" a number of times since its creation.
on 22 march 2006, eta sent a dvd message to the basque network euskal irrati-telebista and the journals "gara" and berria with a communiqué from the group announcing what it called a "permanent ceasefire" that was broadcast over spanish tv.
talks with the group were then officially opened by spanish "presidente del gobierno" josé luis rodríguez zapatero.
these took place all over 2006, not free from incidents such as an eta cell stealing some 300 handguns, ammunition and spare parts in france in october 2006. or a series of warnings made by eta such as the one of 23 september, when masked eta militants declared that the group would "keep taking up arms" until achieving "independence and socialism in the basque country", which were regarded by some as a way to increase pressure on the talks, by others as a tactic to reinforce eta's position in the negotiations.
finally, on 30 december 2006 eta detonated a van bomb after three confusing warning calls, in a parking building at the madrid barajas international airport. the explosion caused the collapse of the building and killed two ecuadorian immigrants who were napping inside their cars in the parking building. at , josé luis rodríguez zapatero released a statement stating that the "peace process" had been discontinued.
in january 2008, eta stated that its call for independence is similar to that of the kosovo status and scotland.
in the week of 8 september 2008, two basque political parties were banned by a spanish court for their secretive links to eta. in another case in the same week, 21 people were convicted whose work on behalf of eta prisoners actually belied secretive links to the armed separatists themselves. eta reacted to these actions by placing three major car bombs in less than 24 hours in northern spain.
in april 2009 jurdan martitegi was arrested, making him the fourth consecutive eta military chief to be captured within a single year, an unprecedented police record, further weakening the group. violence surged in the middle of 2009, with several eta attacks leaving three people dead and dozens injured around spain.
the basque newspaper "gara" published an article that suggested that eta member jon anza could have been killed and buried by spanish police in april 2009. the central prosecutor in the french town of bayonne, anne kayanakis, announced, as the official version, that the autopsy carried out on the body of jon anza – a suspected member of the armed basque group eta, missing since april 2009 – revealed no signs of having been beaten, wounded or shot, which should rule out any suspicions that he died from unnatural causes. nevertheless, that very magistrate denied the demand of the family asking for the presence of a family doctor during the autopsy. after this, jon anza's family members asked for a second autopsy to be carried out.
in december 2009, spain raised its terror alert after warning that eta could be planning major attacks or high-profile kidnappings during spain's european union presidency. the next day, after being asked by the opposition, alfredo pérez rubalcaba said that warning was part of a strategy.
on 5 september 2010, eta declared a new ceasefire, its third, after two previous ceasefires were ended by the group. a spokesperson speaking on a video announcing the ceasefire said the group wished to use "peaceful, democratic means" to achieve its aims, though it was not specified whether the ceasefire was considered permanent by the group. eta claimed that it had made the decision to initiate a ceasefire several months prior to the announcement. in part of the video, the spokesperson said that the group was "prepared today as yesterday to agree to the minimum democratic conditions necessary to put in motion a democratic process, if the spanish government is willing."
the announcement was met with a mixed reaction; basque nationalist politicians responded positively, and said that the spanish and international governments should do the same, while the spanish interior counselor of basque, rodolfo ares, said that the commitment did not go far enough. he said that he considered eta's statement "absolutely insufficient" because it did not commit to a complete termination of what ares considered "terrorist activity" by the group.
on 10 january 2011, eta declared that their september 2010 ceasefire would be permanent and verifiable by international observers. observers urged caution, pointing out that eta had broken permanent ceasefires in the past, whereas prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero (who left office in december 2011) demanded that eta declare that it had given up violence once and for all. after the declaration, spanish press started speculating of a possible real ira-type split within eta, with hardliners forming a new more violent offshoot led by "dienteputo".
on 21 october 2011, eta announced a cessation of armed activity via video clip sent to media outlets following the donostia-san sebastián international peace conference, which was attended by former un secretary-general kofi annan, former taoiseach of ireland bertie ahern, former prime minister of norway gro harlem brundtland (an international leader in sustainable development and public health), former interior minister of france pierre joxe, president of sinn féin gerry adams (a teachta dála in dáil éireann), and british diplomat jonathan powell, who served as the first downing street chief of staff.
they all signed a final declaration that was supported also by former uk prime minister tony blair, the former us president and 2002 nobel peace prize winner jimmy carter, and the former us senator and former us special envoy for middle east peace george j. mitchell. the meeting did not include spanish or french government representatives.
the day after the ceasefire, in a contribution piece to the "new york times", tony blair indicated that lessons in dealing with paramilitary separatist groups can be learned from the way in which the spanish administration handled eta. blair wrote, "governments must firmly defend themselves, their principles and their people against terrorists. this requires good police and intelligence work as well as political determination. [however], firm security pressure on terrorists must be coupled with offering them a way out when they realize that they cannot win by violence. terrorist groups are rarely defeated by military means alone". blair also suggested that spain will need to discuss weapon decommissioning, peace strategies, reparations for victims, and security with eta, as britain has discussed with the provisional ira.
eta has declared ceasefires many times before, most significantly in 1999 and 2006, but the spanish government and media outlets expressed particularly hopeful opinions regarding the permanence of this proclamation. spanish premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero described the move as "a victory for democracy, law and reason". additionally, the effort of security and intelligence forces in spain and france are cited by politicians as the primary instruments responsible for the weakening of eta. the optimism may come as a surprise considering eta's failure to renounce the independence movement, which has been one of the spanish government's requirements. eta's ceasefire video ended with the assertion that the struggle for the basque homeland continues.
less optimistically, spanish prime minister mariano rajoy of the center-right people's party expressed the need to push for the full dissolution of eta. the people's party has emphasized the obligation of the state to refuse negotiations with separatist movements since former prime minister josé maría aznar was in office. aznar was responsible for banning media outlets seen as subversive to the state and batasuna, the political party of eta. additionally, in preparation for his party's manifesto, on 30 october 2011, rajoy declared that the people's party would not negotiate with eta under threats of violence nor announcements of the group's termination, but would instead focus party efforts on remembering and honoring victims of separatist violence.
while eta pledged to refrain from a violent separatist movement, the separatist movement was not denounced. the eta announcement reinforced the struggle for the basque homeland, but through the use of democratic means. this event may not alter the goals of the basque separatist movement, but will change the method of the fight for a more autonomous state. negotiations with the newly elected administration may prove difficult with the return to the center-right people's party, which is replacing socialist control, due to pressure from within the party to refuse all eta negotiations.
in september 2016, french police stated that they did not believe eta had made progress in giving up arms. in march 2017, well-known french-basque activist was quoted as having told "le monde", "eta has made us responsible for the disarmament of its arsenal, and by the afternoon of 8 april, eta will be completely unarmed." on 7 april, the bbc reported that eta would disarm "tomorrow", including a photo of a stamped eta letter attesting to this. the french police found 3.5 tonnes of weapons on 8 april, the following day, at the caches handed over by eta.
eta, for its part, issued a statement endorsing the 2017 catalan independence referendum.
eta announced its full dissolution effective from 2 may 2018.
eta's targets expanded from military or police-related personnel and their families, to a wider array, which included the following:
eta's tactics included:
these bombs sometimes killed family members of eta's target victim and bystanders. when the bombs were large car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they were generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of eta. charities (usually detente y ayuda—dya) were also used to announce the threat if the bomb was in a populated area. the type of explosives used in these attacks were initially goma-2 or self-produced ammonal. after a number of successful robberies in france, eta began using titadyne.
with its attacks against what they considered "enemies of the basque people", eta has killed over 820 people since 1968 to date, including more than 340 civilians. it has maimed hundreds more and kidnapped dozens.
its ability to inflict violence had declined steadily since the group was at its strongest during the late 1970s and 1980 (when it killed 92 people in a single year). after decreasing peaks in the fatal casualties in 1987 and 1991, 2000 was the last year when eta killed more than 20 in a single year. after 2002, the yearly number of eta's fatal casualties was reduced to single digits.
similarly, over the 1990s and, especially, during the 2000s, fluid cooperation between the french and spanish police, state-of-the-art tracking devices and techniques and, apparently, police infiltration allowed increasingly repeating blows to eta's leadership and structure (between may 2008 and april 2009 no less than four consecutive "military chiefs" were arrested).
eta operated mainly in spain, particularly in the basque country, navarre, and (to a lesser degree) madrid, barcelona, and the tourist areas of the spanish mediterranean coast. to date, about 65% of eta's killings were committed in the basque country, followed by madrid with roughly 15%. navarre and catalonia also registered significant numbers.
actions in france usually consisted of assaults on arsenals or military industries in order to steal weapons or explosives; these were usually stored in large quantities in hide-outs located in the french basque country rather than spain. the french judge laurence le vert was threatened by eta and a plot arguably aiming to assassinate her was unveiled. only very rarely have eta members engaged in shootings with the french gendarmerie. this often occurred mainly when members of the group were confronted at checkpoints.
in spite of this, on 1 december 2007 eta killed two spanish civil guards on counter-terrorist surveillance duties in capbreton, landes, france. this was its first killing after it ended its 2006 declaration of "permanent ceasefire" and the first killing committed by eta in france of a spanish police agent since 1976, when they kidnapped, tortured and assassinated two spanish inspectors in hendaye.
in 2007, police reports pointed out that, after the serious blows suffered by eta and its political counterparts during the 2000s, its budget would have been adjusted to 2,000,000 euros annually.
although eta used robbery as a means of financing its activities in its early days, it was accused both of arms trafficking and of benefiting economically from its political counterpart batasuna. extortion was eta's main source of funds.
eta was considered to form part of what is informally known as the basque national liberation movement, a movement born much after eta's creation. this loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically akin, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of leftist basque nationalism that is often referred to by the basque-language term "ezker abertzalea" (nationalist left). other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party batasuna, the nationalist youth organization segi, the labour union langile abertzaleen batzordeak (lab), and askatasuna among others. there are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.
there are basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of eta (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. they are: eaj-pnv, eusko alkartasuna, aralar and, in the french basque country, abertzaleen batasuna. in addition, a number of left-wing parties, such as ezker batua, batzarre and some sectors of the eaj-pnv party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.
historically, members of eta took refuge in france, particularly the french basque country. the leadership typically chose to live in france for security reasons, where police pressure was much less than in spain. accordingly, eta's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the french basque country so as to get french acquiescence for their activities. the french government quietly tolerated the group, especially during franco's regime, when eta members could face the death penalty in spain. in the 1980s, the advent of the gal still hindered counter-terrorist cooperation between france and spain, with the french government considering eta a spanish domestic problem. at the time, eta members often travelled between the two countries using the french sanctuary as a base of operations.
with the disbanding of the gal, the french government changed its position on the matter and in the 1990s initiated the ongoing period of active cooperation with the spanish government against eta, including fast-track transfers of detainees to spanish tribunals that are regarded as fully compliant with european union legislation on human rights and the legal representation of detainees. virtually all of the highest ranks within eta –including their successive "military", "political" or finances chiefs – have been captured in french territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from spain.
in response to the new situation, eta carried out attacks against french policemen and made threats to some french judges and prosecutors. this implied a change from the group's previous low-profile in the french basque country, which successive eta leaders had used to discreetly manage their activities in spain.
eta considers its prisoners political prisoners. until 2003, eta consequently forbade them to ask penal authorities for progression to "tercer grado" (a form of open prison that allows single-day or weekend furloughs) or parole. before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. some were assassinated by eta for leaving the group and going through reinsertion programs.
the spanish government passed the "ley de partidos políticos". this is a law barring political parties that support violence and do not condemn terrorist actions or are involved with terrorist groups.<ref name="ley 6/2002">ley orgánica 6/2002, de 27 de junio, de partidos políticos. noticias.juridicas.com (21 january 2011). retrieved on 30 january 2011.</ref> the law resulted in the banning of herri batasuna and its successor parties unless they explicitly condemned terrorist actions and, at times, imprisoning or trying some of its leaders who have been indicted for cooperation with eta.
judge baltasar garzón has initiated a judicial procedure (coded as "18/98"), aimed towards the support structure of eta. this procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper "egin" (and its associated radio-station "egin irratia"), accused of being linked to eta, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its "investigative unit", pepe rei, under similar accusations. in august 1999 judge baltasar garzón authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they could not reopen due to economic difficulties.
judicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:
, indicted members of the youth movements haika, segi and jarrai have been found guilty (january 2007) of a crime of connivance with terrorism. most of the other trials are still under process.
on tuesday 20 may 2008, leading eta figures were arrested in bordeaux, france. francisco javier lópez peña, also known as 'thierry,' had been on the run for twenty years before his arrest. a final total of arrests brought in six people, including eta members and supporters, including the ex-mayor of andoain, josé antonio barandiarán, who is rumoured to have led police to 'thierry'. the spanish interior ministry claimed the relevance of the arrests would come in time with the investigation. furthermore, the interior minister said that those members of eta now arrested had ordered the latest attacks, and that senior eta member francisco javier lópez peña was "not just another arrest because he is, in all probability, the man who has most political and military weight in the terrorist group."
after lopez pena's arrest, along with the basque referendum being put on hold, police work has been on the rise. on 22 july 2008, spanish police dismantled the most active cell of eta by detaining nine suspected members of the group. interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said about the arrests: "we can't say this is the only eta unit but it was the most active, most dynamic and of course the most wanted one." four days later french police also arrested two suspects believed to be tied to the same active cell. the two suspects were: asier eceiza, considered a top aide to a senior eta operative still sought by police, and olga comes, whom authorities have linked to the eta suspects.
the european union and the united states list eta as a terrorist group in their relevant watch lists. eta has been a proscribed organisation in the united kingdom under the terrorism act 2000 since 29 march 2001. the canadian parliament listed eta as a terrorist group in 2003.
france and spain have often shown co-operation in the fight against eta, after france's lack of co-operation during the franco era. in late 2007, two spanish guards were shot to death in france when on a joint operation with their french counterparts. furthermore, in may 2008, the arrests of four people in bordeaux led to a major breakthrough against eta, according to the spanish interior ministry.
on 2 october 2008, as eta activity increased, france increased its pressure on eta by arresting more eta suspects, including unai fano, maría lizarraga on 23 september, and esteban murillo zubiri in bidarrain. he had been wanted by the spanish authorities since 2007 when a europol arrest warrant was issued against him. french judicial authorities had already ordered that he be held in prison on remand.
spain has also sought cooperation from the united kingdom in dealing with eta-ira ties. in november 2008, this came to light after iñaki de juana chaos, whose release from prison was canceled on appeal, had moved to belfast. he was thought to be staying at an ira safe house while being sought by the spanish authorities. interpol notified the judge, eloy velasco, that he was in either the republic of ireland or northern ireland.

the endomembrane system is composed of the different membranes that are suspended in the cytoplasm within a eukaryotic cell. these membranes divide the cell into functional and structural compartments, or organelles. in eukaryotes the organelles of the endomembrane system include: the nuclear membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, endosomes, and plasma (cell) membrane among others. the system is defined more accurately as the set of membranes that form a single functional and developmental unit, either being connected directly, or exchanging material through vesicle transport. importantly, the endomembrane system does not include the membranes of chloroplasts or mitochondria, but might have evolved from the latter (see below: evolution).
the nuclear membrane contains a lipid bilayer that encompass the contents of the nucleus. the endoplasmic reticulum (er) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. the golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. a vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. the cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. there is also an organelle known as the spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.
in prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, although in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and most of the cell cytoplasm is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane. these light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.
the organelles of the endomembrane system are related through direct contact or by the transfer of membrane segments as vesicles. despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. the thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified several times during the membrane's life. one unifying characteristic the membranes share is a lipid bilayer, with proteins attached to either side or traversing them.
most lipids are synthesized in yeast either in the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, with little or no lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the golgi apparatus. the situation is similar in mammals, with the exception of the first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. the various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. however, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.
the first proposal that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by morré and mollenhauer in 1974. this proposal was made as a way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through "lipid flow" from the sites of lipid synthesis. the idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.
the nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. it has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. the outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. the outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the nuclear envelope. these pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some to pass through the membrane, but not others. since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they play an important role in the physiology of cells. the space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough er.
the nuclear envelope's structure is determined by a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). this network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus. the nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in the disintegration of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and its reassembly at the end of the process.
the nuclear pores are highly efficient at selectively allowing the passage of materials to and from the nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. rna and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. histones, gene regulatory proteins, dna and rna polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. the nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. if the cell is synthesizing dna each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. if the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.
the endoplasmic reticulum (er) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle that is an extension of the nuclear envelope. more than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the er. the er is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the er membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. this highly convoluted space is called the er lumen and is also referred to as the er cisternal space. the lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. the endoplasmic reticulum membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
the er has a central role in producing, processing, and transporting biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the er itself, the golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the er, golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the er lumen. consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. these special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. an example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperone protein known as bip which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.
the er is involved in cotranslational sorting of proteins. a polypeptide which contains an er signal sequence is recognised by a signal recognition protein which halts the production of the protein. the srp transports the polypeptide to the er membrane where its released in through a membrane pore and translation resumes.
there are two distinct, though connected, regions of er that differ in structure and function: smooth er and rough er. the rough endoplasmic reticulum is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. the smooth er appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.
in the great majority of cells, smooth er regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. they are sometimes called transitional er because they contain er exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the golgi apparatus. in certain specialized cells, however, the smooth er is abundant and has additional functions. the smooth er of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.
enzymes of the smooth er are vital to the synthesis of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. sex hormones of vertebrates and the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands are among the steroids produced by the smooth er in animal cells. the cells that synthesize these hormones are rich in smooth er.
liver cells are another example of specialized cells that contain an abundance of smooth er. these cells provide an example of the role of smooth er in carbohydrate metabolism. liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. the breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. however, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. this is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth er removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.
enzymes of the smooth er can also help detoxify drugs and poisons. detoxification usually involves the addition of a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. one extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.
muscle cells have another specialized function of smooth er. the er membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. when a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes back across the er membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.
many types of cells export proteins produced by ribosomes attached to the rough er. the ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough er for further adjustments. these proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able to pass through the membrane into the lumen. those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.
once secretory proteins are formed, the er membrane separates them from the proteins that will remain in the cytosol. secretory proteins depart from the er enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional er. these vesicles in transit to another part of the cell are called transport vesicles. an alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the er are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the er becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, golgi or lysosomes.
in addition to making secretory proteins, the rough er makes membranes that grows in place from the addition of proteins and phospholipids. as polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the er membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. the rough er also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the er membrane assemble phospholipids. the er membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.
the golgi apparatus (also known as the golgi body and the golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called cisternae. its shape is similar to a stack of pancakes. the number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. the golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. the section of the golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from the er is known as the cis face, and is usually near the er. the opposite end of the golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. the trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the golgi apparatus modifies are sent.
vesicles sent off by the er containing proteins are further altered at the golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport to other parts of the cell. various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the golgi apparatus. the modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. the golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. in addition to modifying proteins, the golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. in plant cells, the golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.
once the modification process is completed, the golgi apparatus sorts the products of its processing and sends them to various parts of the cell. molecular identification labels or tags are added by the golgi enzymes to help with this. after everything is organized, the golgi apparatus sends off its products by budding vesicles from its trans face.
vacuoles, like vesicles, are membrane-bound sacs within the cell. they are larger than vesicles and their specific function varies. the operations of vacuoles are different for plant and animal vacuoles.
in plant cells, vacuoles cover anywhere from 30% to 90% of the total cell volume. most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. the solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. vacuoles can also increase the size of the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic ph and contain hydrolytic enzymes. the ph of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. for example, when the ph in the cells environment drops, the h ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole in order to keep the cytosol's ph constant.
in animals, vacuoles serve in exocytosis and endocytosis processes. endocytosis refers to when substances are taken into the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. there are two types of endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). in phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.
vesicles are small membrane-enclosed transport units that can transfer molecules between different compartments.most vesicles transfer the membranes assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus, and then from the golgi apparatus to various locations.
there are various types of vesicles each with a different protein configuration. most are formed from specific regions of membranes. when a vesicle buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. each membrane a vesicle travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface. this marker corresponds with the proteins on the vesicle traveling to the membrane. once the vesicle finds the membrane, they fuse.
there are three well known types of vesicles. they are clathrin-coated, copi-coated, and copii-coated vesicles. each performs different functions in the cell. for example, clathrin-coated vesicles transport substances between the golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. copi- and copii-coated vesicles are frequently used for transportation between the er and the golgi apparatus.
lysosomes are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that are used for intracellular digestion. the main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. the enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a ph of 5.0 inside of the organelle. if a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral ph. however, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.
lysosomes carry out intracellular digestion, in a process called phagocytosis (from the greek , to eat and , vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. the lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. the resulting organic monomers are then returned to the cytosol for reuse. the last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.
the spitzenkörper is a component of the endomembrane system found only in fungi, and is associated with hyphal tip growth. it is a phase-dark body that is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components, serving as a point of assemblage and release of such components intermediate between the golgi and the cell membrane. the spitzenkörper is motile and generates new hyphal tip growth as it moves forward.
the plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer membrane that separates the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals into and out of the cell. embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the plasma membrane. the plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. this movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.
the plasma membrane of a cell has multiple functions. these include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the ph of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. these proteins use atp hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.
in addition to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.
the origin of the endomembrane system is linked to the origin of eukaryotes themselves and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. many models have been put forward to explain the origin of the endomembrane system (reviewed in). the most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. this omv-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.

ethnology (from the greek "ἔθνος", "ethnos" meaning "nation") is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different peoples and the relationships between them (cf. cultural, social, or sociocultural anthropology).
compared to ethnography, the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.
the term "ethnologia" ("ethnology") is credited to adam franz kollár (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his "historiae ivrisqve pvblici regni vngariae amoenitates" published in vienna in 1783. as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.”
kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual kingdom of hungary and his roots among its slovaks, and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the ottoman empire in the more distant balkans.
among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of human history, and the formulation of cultural invariants, such as the incest taboo and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "human nature", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers (hegel, marx, structuralism, etc.). in some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with "cultural anthropology" becoming dominant especially in the united states, and "social anthropology" in great britain. the distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.
the 15th-century exploration of america by european explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the occident (the western world), such as the notion of the "other". this term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "noble savage". thus, civilization was opposed in a dualist manner to barbary, a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared ethnocentrism. the progress of ethnology, for example with claude lévi-strauss's structural anthropology, led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress, or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth.
lévi-strauss often referred to montaigne's essay on cannibalism as an early example of ethnology. lévi-strauss aimed, through a structural method, at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the incest taboo. however, the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including marx, nietzsche, foucault, derrida, althusser, and deleuze.
the french school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. important figures in this movement have included lévi-strauss, paul rivet, marcel griaule, germaine dieterlen, and jean rouch.

espagnole sauce () is a basic brown sauce, and is one of auguste escoffier's five mother sauces of classic french cooking. this sauce was already compiled in different spanish cooking handbooks of the late 19th century, and escoffier popularized the recipe, which is still followed today.
espagnole has a strong taste, and is rarely used directly on food. as a mother sauce, it serves as the starting point for many derivatives, such as sauce africaine, sauce bigarade, sauce bourguignonne, sauce aux champignons, sauce charcutière, sauce chasseur, sauce chevreuil, and demi-glace. hundreds of other derivatives are in the classical french repertoire.
escoffier included a recipe for a lenten espagnole sauce, using fish stock and mushrooms, in "le guide culinaire", but doubted its necessity.
the basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown roux, to which veal stock or water is added, along with browned bones, pieces of beef, vegetables, and various seasonings. this blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. the classic recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces, but today, water is generally used instead. tomato paste or pureed tomatoes are added towards the end of the process, and the sauce is further reduced.
"espagnole" is the french word for "spanish", but the sauce's origin story is argued by french cooks. according to louis diat, the creator of "vichyssoise" and the author of the classic "gourmet's basic french cookbook": "there is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in french cuisine is called "sauce espagnole", or spanish sauce. according to the story, the spanish cooks of louis xiii's bride, anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of france with spanish tomatoes. this new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honor of its creators."
in "kettner's book of the table", published in 1877, an entirely different explanation is given:
the name "kettner" in the title refers to auguste kettner, former chef to napoleon iii, who emigrated to england and in 1867 opened a restaurant in soho—"kettner's"—one of the oldest restaurants in london.

an amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). it is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. the amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. an amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.
an amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. amplifiers can be categorized in different ways. one is by the frequency of the electronic signal being amplified. for example, audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20 khz, rf amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20 khz and 300 ghz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current. amplifiers can also be categorized by their physical placement in the signal chain; a preamplifier may precede other signal processing stages, for example. the first practical electrical device which could amplify was the triode vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by lee de forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. today most amplifiers use transistors.
the first practical device that could amplify was the triode vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by lee de forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. vacuum tubes were used in almost all amplifiers until the 1960s–1970s when the transistor, invented in 1947, replaced them. today, most amplifiers use transistors, but vacuum tubes continue to be used in some applications.
the development of audio communication technology in form of the telephone, first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the transmission of signals over increasingly long distances. in telegraphy, this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a relay, so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.
for duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed starting with the work of c. f. varley for telegraphic transmission. duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when h. e. shreeve of the american telephone and telegraph company improved existing attempts at constructing a telephone repeater consisting of back-to-back carbon-granule transmitter and electrodynamic receiver pairs. the shreeve repeater was first tested on a line between boston and amesbury, ma, and more refined devices remained in service for some time. after the turn of the century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and were also tried in repeaters, with little success.
the development of thermionic valves starting around 1902, provided an entirely electronic method of amplifying signals. the first practical version of such devices was the audion triode, invented in 1906 by lee de forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. since the only previous device which was widely used to strengthen a signal was the relay used in telegraph systems, the amplifying vacuum tube was first called an "electron relay". the terms "amplifier" and "amplification", derived from the latin "amplificare", ("to enlarge or expand"), were first used for this new capability around 1915 when triodes became widespread.
the amplifying vacuum tube revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of electronics, the technology of active electrical devices. it made possible long distance telephone lines, public address systems, radio broadcasting, talking motion pictures, practical audio recording, radar, television, and the first computers. for 50 years virtually all consumer electronic devices used vacuum tubes. early tube amplifiers often had positive feedback (regeneration), which could increase gain but also make the amplifier unstable and prone to oscillation. much of the mathematical theory of amplifiers was developed at bell telephone laboratories during the 1920s to 1940s. distortion levels in early amplifiers were high, usually around 5%, until 1934, when harold black developed negative feedback; this allowed the distortion levels to be greatly reduced, at the cost of lower gain. other advances in the theory of amplification were made by harry nyquist and hendrik wade bode.
the vacuum tube was virtually the only amplifying device, other than specialized power devices such as the magnetic amplifier and amplidyne, for 40 years. power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until the latter half of the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. the old shreeve electroacoustic carbon repeaters were used in adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s.
the replacement of bulky electron tubes with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the transistor radio developed in 1954. today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.
beginning in the 1970s, more and more transistors were connected on a single chip thereby creating higher scales of integration (small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale, etc.) in integrated circuits. many amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.
for special purposes, other active elements have been used. for example, in the early days of the satellite communication, parametric amplifiers were used. the core circuit was a diode whose capacitance was changed by an rf signal created locally. under certain conditions, this rf signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station.
advances in digital electronics since the late 20th century provided new alternatives to the traditional linear-gain amplifiers by using digital switching to vary the pulse-shape of fixed amplitude signals, resulting in devices such as the class-d amplifier.
in principle, an amplifier is an electrical two-port network that produces a signal at the output port that is a replica of the signal applied to the input port, but increased in magnitude.
the input port can be idealized as either being a voltage input, which takes no current, with the output proportional to the voltage across the port; or a current input, with no voltage across it, in which the output is proportional to the current through the port. the output port can be idealized as being either a dependent voltage source, with zero source resistance and its output voltage dependent on the input; or a dependent current source, with infinite source resistance and the output current dependent on the input. combinations of these choices lead to four types of ideal amplifiers. in idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of dependent source used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:
each type of amplifier in its ideal form has an ideal input and output resistance that is the same as that of the corresponding dependent source:
in real amplifiers the ideal impedances are not possible to achieve, but these ideal elements can be used to construct equivalent circuits of real amplifiers by adding impedances (resistance, capacitance and inductance) to the input and output. for any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis is often used to find the actual impedance. a small-signal ac test current "i" is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to ac zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage "v" across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as "r = v / i".
amplifiers designed to attach to a transmission line at input and output, especially rf amplifiers, do not fit into this classification approach. rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match "ratios" of voltage to current. many real rf amplifiers come close to this ideal. although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, rf amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.
amplifier properties are given by parameters that include:
amplifiers are described according to the properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate. all amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. the gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage (voltage gain), output power to input power (power gain), or some combination of current, voltage, and power. in many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in decibels (db)).
most amplifiers are designed to be linear. that is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. if an amplifier's gain is not linear, the output signal can become distorted. there are, however, cases where variable gain is useful. certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.
amplifiers are usually designed to function well in a specific application, for example: radio and television transmitters and receivers, high-fidelity ("hi-fi") stereo equipment, microcomputers and other digital equipment, and guitar and other instrument amplifiers. every amplifier includes at least one active device, such as a vacuum tube or transistor.
negative feedback is a technique used in most modern amplifiers to improve bandwidth and distortion and control gain. in a negative feedback amplifier part of the output is fed back and added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting from the input. the main effect is to reduce the overall gain of the system. however, any unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier, such as distortion are also fed back. since they are not part of the original input, they are added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting them from the input. in this way, negative feedback also reduces nonlinearity, distortion and other errors introduced by the amplifier. large amounts of negative feedback can reduce errors to the point that the response of the amplifier itself becomes almost irrelevant as long as it has a large gain, and the output performance of the system (the "closed loop performance") is defined entirely by the components in the feedback loop. this technique is particularly used with operational amplifiers (op-amps).
non-feedback amplifiers can only achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. with negative feedback, distortion can typically be reduced to 0.001%. noise, even crossover distortion, can be practically eliminated. negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output. indeed, the ability of the feedback loop to define the output is used to make active filter circuits.
another advantage of negative feedback is that it extends the bandwidth of the amplifier. the concept of feedback is used in operational amplifiers to precisely define gain, bandwidth, and other parameters entirely based on the components in the feedback loop.
negative feedback can be applied at each stage of an amplifier to stabilize the operating point of active devices against minor changes in power-supply voltage or device characteristics.
some feedback, positive or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable—introduced, for example, by parasitic elements, such as inherent capacitance between input and output of devices such as transistors, and capacitive coupling of external wiring. excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce parasitic oscillation and turn an amplifier into an oscillator.
all amplifiers include some form of active device: this is the device that does the actual amplification. the active device can be a vacuum tube, discrete solid state component, such as a single transistor, or part of an integrated circuit, as in an op-amp).
transistor amplifiers (or solid state amplifiers) are the most common type of amplifier in use today. a transistor is used as the active element. the gain of the amplifier is determined by the properties of the transistor itself as well as the circuit it is contained within.
common active devices in transistor amplifiers include bipolar junction transistors (bjts) and metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (mosfets).
applications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or public address system, rf high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to rf and microwave applications such as radio transmitters.
transistor-based amplification can be realized using various configurations: for example a bipolar junction transistor can realize common base, common collector or common emitter amplification; a mosfet can realize common gate, common source or common drain amplification. each configuration has different characteristics.
vacuum-tube amplifiers (also known as tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. while semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers can be much more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, as well as in musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for "tube sound".
magnetic amplifiers are devices somewhat similar to a transformer where one winding is used to control the saturation of a magnetic core and hence alter the impedance of the other winding.
they have largely fallen out of use due to development in semiconductor amplifiers but are still useful in hvdc control, and in nuclear power control circuitry due to not being affected by radioactivity.
negative resistances can be used as amplifiers, such as the tunnel diode amplifier.
a power amplifier is an amplifier designed primarily to increase the power available to a load. in practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, as well as the inherent voltage and current gain. a radio frequency (rf) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. an amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20 db might have a voltage gain of 20 db and an available power gain of much more than 20 db (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600 ω microphone and the output connects to a 47 kω input socket for a power amplifier. in general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.
audio power amplifiers are typically used to drive loudspeakers. they will often have two output channels and deliver equal power to each. an rf power amplifier is found in radio transmitter final stages. a servo motor controller: amplifies a control voltage to adjust the speed of a motor, or the position of a motorized system.
an operational amplifier is an amplifier circuit which typically has very high open loop gain and differential inputs. op amps have become very widely used as standardized "gain blocks" in circuits due to their versatility; their gain, bandwidth and other characteristics can be controlled by feedback through an external circuit. though the term today commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original operational amplifier design used valves, and later designs used discrete transistor circuits.
a fully differential amplifier is similar to the operational amplifier, but also has differential outputs. these are usually constructed using bjts or fets.
these use balanced transmission lines to separate individual single stage amplifiers, the outputs of which are summed by the same transmission line. the transmission line is a balanced type with the input at one end and on one side only of the balanced transmission line and the output at the opposite end is also the opposite side of the balanced transmission line. the gain of each stage adds linearly to the output rather than multiplies one on the other as in a cascade configuration. this allows a higher bandwidth to be achieved than could otherwise be realised even with the same gain stage elements.
these nonlinear amplifiers have much higher efficiencies than linear amps, and are used where the power saving justifies the extra complexity. class-d amplifiers are the main example of this type of amplification.
negative resistance amplifier is a type of regenerative amplifier that can use the feedback between the transistor's source and gate to transform a capacitive impedance on the transistor’s source to a negative resistance on its gate. compared to other types of amplifiers, this "negative resistance amplifier" will only require a tiny amount of power to achieve very high gain, maintaining a good noise figure at the same time.
video amplifiers are designed to process video signals and have varying bandwidths depending on whether the video signal is for sdtv, edtv, hdtv 720p or 1080i/p etc.. the specification of the bandwidth itself depends on what kind of filter is used—and at which point ( or for example) the bandwidth is measured. certain requirements for step response and overshoot are necessary for an acceptable tv image.
traveling wave tube amplifiers (twtas) are used for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. they typically can amplify across a broad spectrum of frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons.
klystrons are specialized linear-beam vacuum-devices, designed to provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than twtas, they have the advantage of coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.
solid-state devices are used such as gaas fets, impatt diodes, and others, especially at lower microwave frequencies and power levels on the order of watts.
the maser is a non-electronic microwave amplifier.
instrument amplifiers are a range of audio power amplifiers used to increase the sound level of musical instruments, for example guitars, during performances.
one set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. in the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and common collector. for field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for vacuum tubes, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.
the common emitter (or common source, common cathode, etc.) is most often configured to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. the common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. this causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. this arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. the common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.
an amplifier whose output exhibits no feedback to its input side is described as 'unilateral'. the input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of load, and output impedance is independent of signal source impedance.
an amplifier that uses feedback to connect part of the output back to the input is a "bilateral" amplifier. bilateral amplifier input impedance depends on the load, and output impedance on the signal source impedance.
all amplifiers are bilateral to some degree; however they may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where feedback is small enough to neglect for most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the common base article for an example).
another way to classify amplifiers is by the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. an 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an oscilloscope). a 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. an emitter follower is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.
this description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.
other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. these functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages.
amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. different types of these include:
depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.
frequency ranges down to dc are only used when this property is needed. amplifiers for direct current signals are vulnerable to minor variations in the properties of components with time. special methods, such as chopper stabilized amplifiers are used to prevent objectionable drift in the amplifier's properties for dc. "dc-blocking" capacitors can be added to remove dc and sub-sonic frequencies from audio amplifiers.
depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. up to the mhz range only "discrete" properties need be considered; e.g., a terminal has an input impedance.
as soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g., at 100 mhz the wavelength is 3 m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3 cm) design properties radically change. for example, a specified length and width of a pcb trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.
above a few hundred mhz, it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. in most cases, pcb traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead (stripline techniques).
the frequency range handled by an amplifier might be specified in terms of bandwidth (normally implying a response that is 3 db down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a frequency response that is within a certain number of decibels between a lower and an upper frequency (e.g. "20 hz to 20 khz plus or minus 1 db").
power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as a, b, ab and c for analog designs—and class d and e for switching designs. the power amplifier classes are based on the proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current. the image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. if the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360°. if it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180°. the angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency.
the practical amplifier circuit shown above could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. it features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-ab push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with fets or valves.
the input signal is coupled through capacitor c1 to the base of transistor q1. the capacitor allows the ac signal to pass, but blocks the dc bias voltage established by resistors r1 and r2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. q1 and q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. this arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to q2 via r7 and r8.
the negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. the amplified signal from q1 is directly fed to the second stage, q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the dc bias for the output stages, q4 and q5. r6 provides the load for q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). so far, all of the amplifier is operating in class a. the output pair are arranged in class-ab push–pull, also called a complementary pair. they provide the majority of the current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via dc-blocking capacitor c2. the diodes d1 and d2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. that is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-ab mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).
this design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from dc up through the audio range and beyond. further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.
a common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically one ohm or so. calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.
any real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. an important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. an amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. the power supply may influence the output, so must be considered in the design. the power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.
the amplifier circuit has an "open loop" performance. this is described by various parameters (gain, slew rate, output impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.). many modern amplifiers use negative feedback techniques to hold the gain at the desired value and reduce distortion. negative loop feedback has the intended effect of lowering the output impedance and thereby increasing electrical damping of loudspeaker motion at and near the resonance frequency of the speaker.
when assessing rated amplifier power output, it is useful to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). in high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source and loads. this avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.
to prevent instability or overheating requires care to ensure solid state amplifiers are adequately loaded. most have a rated minimum load impedance.
all amplifiers generate heat through electrical losses. the amplifier must dissipate this heat via convection or forced air cooling. heat can damage or reduce electronic component service life. designers and installers must also consider heating effects on adjacent equipment.
different power supply types result in many different methods of bias. bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the dc component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. class-a amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. class-c amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.
amplifiers often have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. for instance, the first stage might be a class-a stage, feeding a class-ab push–pull second stage, which then drives a class-g final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.

the escort carrier or escort aircraft carrier (us hull classification symbol cve), also called a "jeep carrier" or "baby flattop" in the united states navy (usn) or "woolworth carrier" by the royal navy, was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used by the royal navy, the united states navy, the imperial japanese navy and imperial japanese army air force in world war ii. they were typically half the length and a third the displacement of larger fleet carriers. while they were slower, carried fewer planes and were less well armed and armored, escort carriers were cheaper and could be built quickly, which was their principal advantage. escort carriers could be completed in greater numbers as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. however, the lack of protection made escort carriers particularly vulnerable and several were sunk with great loss of life. the light carrier (hull classification symbol cvl) was a similar concept to escort carriers in most respects, but were capable of higher speeds to allow operation alongside fleet carriers.
most often built on a commercial ship hull, escort carriers were too slow to keep up with the main forces consisting of fleet carriers, battleships, and cruisers. instead, they were used to escort convoys, defending them from enemy threats such as submarines and planes. in the invasions of mainland europe and pacific islands, escort carriers provided air support to ground forces during amphibious operations. escort carriers also served as backup aircraft transports for fleet carriers and ferried aircraft of all military services to points of delivery.
in the battle of the atlantic, escort carriers were used to protect convoys against u-boats. initially escort carriers accompanied the merchant ships and helped to fend off attacks from aircraft and submarines. as numbers increased later in the war, escort carriers also formed part of hunter-killer groups that sought out submarines instead of being attached to a particular convoy.
in the pacific theater, cves provided air support of ground troops in the battle of leyte gulf. they lacked the speed and weapons to counter enemy fleets, relying on the protection of a fast carrier task force. however, at the battle off samar, one u.s. task force of escort carriers managed to successfully defend itself against a much larger japanese force of battleships and cruisers. the japanese met a furious defense of carrier aircraft, screening destroyers, and destroyer escorts, proving that cves could appear to have the same striking power as full cvs.
of the 151 aircraft carriers built in the u.s. during world war ii, 122 were escort carriers. though no examples survive to this day, the was the most numerous class of aircraft carrier, with 50 launched. second was the , with 45 launched.
in the early 1920s, the washington naval treaty imposed limits on the maximum size and total tonnage of aircraft carriers for the five main naval powers. later treaties largely kept these provisions. as a result, construction between the world wars had been insufficient to meet operational needs for aircraft carriers as world war ii expanded from europe. too few fleet carriers were available to simultaneously transport aircraft to distant bases, support amphibious invasions, offer carrier landing training for replacement pilots, conduct anti-submarine patrols, and provide defensive air cover for deployed battleships and cruisers. the foregoing mission requirements limited use of fleet carriers′ unique offensive strike capability demonstrated at the battle of taranto and the attack on pearl harbor. conversion of existing ships (and hulls under construction for other purposes) provided additional aircraft carriers until new construction became available.
conversions of cruisers and passenger liners with speed similar to fleet carriers were identified by the u.s. as "light aircraft carriers" (hull classification symbol cvl) able to operate at battle fleet speeds. slower conversions were classified as "escort carriers" and were considered naval auxiliaries suitable for pilot training and transport of aircraft to distant bases.
the royal navy had recognized a need for carriers to defend its trade routes in the 1930s. while designs had been prepared for "trade protection carriers" and five suitable liners identified for conversion, nothing further was done mostly because there were insufficient aircraft for even the fleet carriers under construction at the time. however, by 1940 the need had become urgent and was converted from the captured german merchant ship mv "hannover" and commissioned in july 1941. for defense from german aircraft, convoys were supplied first with fighter catapult ships and cam ships that could carry a single (disposable) fighter. in the interim, before escort carriers could be supplied, they also brought in merchant aircraft carriers that could operate four aircraft.
in 1940, admiral william halsey recommended construction of naval auxiliaries for pilot training. in early 1941 the british asked the us to build on their behalf six carriers of an improved "audacity" design but the us had already begun their own escort carrier. on 1 february 1941, the united states chief of naval operations gave priority to construction of naval auxiliaries for aircraft transport. u.s. ships built to meet these needs were initially referred to as auxiliary aircraft escort vessels (avg) in february 1942 and then auxiliary aircraft carrier (acv) on 5 august 1942. the first u.s. example of the type was . operation torch and north atlantic anti-submarine warfare proved these ships capable aircraft carriers for ship formations moving at the speed of trade or amphibious invasion convoys. u.s. classification revision to escort aircraft carrier (cve) on 15 july 1943 reflected upgraded status from auxiliary to combatant. they were informally known as "jeep carriers" or "baby flattops". it was quickly found that the escort carriers had better performance than light carriers, which tended to pitch badly in moderate to high seas. the "commencement bay" class was designed to incorporate the best features of american cvls on a more stable hull with a less expensive propulsion system.
among their crews, cve was sarcastically said to stand for "combustible, vulnerable, and expendable". magazine protection was minimal in comparison to fleet aircraft carriers. was sunk within minutes by a single torpedo, and exploded from undetermined causes with very heavy loss of life. three escort carriers—, and —were destroyed by "kamikazes", the largest ships to meet such a fate.
allied escort carriers were typically around long, not much more than half the length of the almost fleet carriers of the same era, but were less than 1/3 of the weight. a typical escort carrier displaced about , as compared to almost for a full-size fleet carrier. the aircraft hangar typically ran only of the way under the flight deck and housed a combination of 24–30 fighters and bombers organized into one single "composite squadron". by comparison, a late "essex"-class fleet carrier could carry a total of 103 aircraft organized into separate fighter, bomber and torpedo-bomber squadrons.
the island on these ships was small and cramped, and located well forward of the funnels (unlike on a normal-sized carrier where the funnels were integrated into the island). although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. the carriers employed the same system of arresting cables and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery were the same as well.
the crew size was less than of that of a large carrier, but this was still a bigger complement than most naval vessels. it was large enough to justify the existence of facilities such as a permanent canteen or snack bar, called a gedunk bar, in addition to the mess. the bar was open for longer hours than the mess and sold several flavors of ice cream, along with cigarettes and other consumables. there were also several vending machines available on board.
in all, 130 allied escort carriers were launched or converted during the war. of these, six were british conversions of merchant ships: , , , , and . the remaining escort carriers were u.s.-built. like the british, the first u.s. escort carriers were converted merchant vessels (or in the , converted military oilers). the "bogue"-class carriers were based on the hull of the type c3 cargo ship. the last 69 escort carriers of the and classes were purpose-designed and purpose-built carriers drawing on the experience gained with the previous classes.
originally developed at the behest of the united kingdom to operate as part of a north atlantic convoy escort, rather than as part of a naval strike force, many of the escort carriers produced were assigned to the royal navy for the duration of the war under the lend-lease act. they supplemented and then replaced the converted merchant aircraft carriers that were put into service by the british and dutch as an emergency measure until the escort carriers became available. as convoy escorts, they were used by the royal navy to provide air scouting, to ward off enemy long-range scouting aircraft and, increasingly, to spot and hunt submarines. often additional escort carriers also joined convoys, not as fighting ships, but as transporters, ferrying aircraft from the u.s. to britain. in this case, the aircraft cargo could be doubled by storing aircraft on the flight deck as well as in the hangar.
the ships sent to the royal navy were slightly modified, partly to suit the traditions of that service. among other things the ice cream making machines were removed, since they were considered unnecessary luxuries on ships, which served grog and other alcoholic beverages. the heavy duty washing machines of the laundry room were also removed since "all a british sailor needs to keep clean is a bucket and a bar of soap" (quoted from warrilow).
other modifications were due to the need for a completely enclosed hangar when operating in the north atlantic and in support of the arctic convoys.
meanwhile, the u.s. discovered their own use for the escort carriers. in the north atlantic, they supplemented the escorting destroyers by providing air support for anti-submarine warfare. one of these escort carriers, , was instrumental in the capture of off north africa in 1944.
in the pacific theater, escort carriers lacked the speed to sail with fast carrier attack groups, so were often tasked to escort the landing ships and troop carriers during the island-hopping campaign. in this role they provided air cover for the troopships and flew the first wave of attacks on beach fortifications in amphibious landing operations. on occasion, they even escorted the large carriers, serving as emergency airstrips and providing fighter cover for their larger sisters while these were busy readying or refueling their own planes. they also transported aircraft and spare parts from the u.s. to remote island airstrips.
the attack on pearl harbor brought up an urgent need for aircraft carriers, so some t3 tankers were converted to escort carriers, is example of how a t3 tanker hull ao-33 was rebuilt to be an escort carrier. the t3 tanker size and speed made the t3 a useful escort carrier. there were two classes of t3 hull carriers: "sangamon" class and "commencement bay" class.
a major battle for these escort carriers was the battle off samar in the philippines on 25 october 1944. the japanese lured admiral william halsey, jr. into chasing a decoy fleet with his 3rd fleet. this left aircraft from 16 small and slow escort carriers in three task groups armed primarily to bomb ground forces; along with their protective screen of destroyers and slower destroyer escorts, with "taffy 3" bearing the brunt of the fight. they faced a japanese force of four battleships, including the formidable , eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers. the american ships held off the japanese.
the slow carriers could not outrun cruisers. they launched their aircraft and maneuvered to avoid shellfire for over an hour. they took dozens of hits, mostly from armor-piercing rounds that passed right through their thin, unarmored hulls without exploding. , sunk in this action, was the only u.s. carrier lost to enemy surface gunfire in the war, and the japanese concentration of fire on this one carrier assisted the escape of the others. the carriers′ only substantial armament—aside from their aircraft—was a single 5 in (127 mm) dual-purpose gun mounted on the stern, but the pursuing japanese cruisers closed to within range of these guns. one of the guns caused critical damage to the burning japanese heavy cruiser and a subsequent bomb dropped from one of the task force′s aircraft hit the heavy cruiser′s forward machinery room, leaving her dead in the water. several "kamikaze" aircraft were shot down by carrier gunners, with only lost to air attack. the americans lost a similar number of ships and men to the battle of coral sea and battle of midway combined.
many escort carriers were lend-leased to the united kingdom, this list specifies the breakdown in service to each navy.
in addition, six escort carriers were produced by the british during the war (all converted from other vessels).
the table below lists escort carriers and similar ships performing the same missions. the first four were built as early fleet aircraft carriers. merchant aircraft carriers (mac) carried trade cargo in addition to operating aircraft. aircraft transports carried larger numbers of planes by eliminating accommodation for operating personnel and storage of fuel and ammunition.
the years following world war ii brought many revolutionary new technologies to the navy, most notably the helicopter and the jet fighter, and with this a complete rethinking of its strategies and ships′ tasks. although several of the latest "commencement bay"-class cve were deployed as floating airfields during the korean war, the main reasons for the development of the escort carrier had disappeared or could be dealt with better by newer weapons. the emergence of the helicopter meant that helicopter-deck equipped frigates could now take over the cve's role in a convoy while also performing their own traditional role as submarine hunters. ship-mounted guided missile launchers took over much of the aircraft protection role, and in-flight refueling abolished the need for floating stopover points for transport or patrol aircraft. as a result, after the "commencement bay" class, no new escort carriers were designed, and with every downsizing of the navy, the cves were the first to be mothballed.
several escort carriers were pressed back into service during the first years of the vietnam war because of their ability to carry large numbers of aircraft. redesignated akv (air transport auxiliary), they were manned by a civilian crew and used to ferry whole aircraft and spare parts from the u.s. to army, air force and marine bases in south vietnam. however, cves were useful in this role only for a limited period. once all major aircraft were equipped with refueling probes, it became much easier to fly the aircraft directly to its base instead of shipping it overseas.
the last chapter in the history of escort carriers consisted of two conversions: as an experiment, was converted from an aircraft carrier into a pure helicopter carrier (cvha-1) and used by the marine corps to carry assault helicopters for the first wave of amphibious warfare operations. later, "thetis bay" became a full amphibious assault ship (lhp-6). although in service only from 1955 (the year of her conversion) to 1964, the experience gained in her training exercises greatly influenced the design of today′s amphibious assault ships.
in the second conversion, in 1961, had all her aircraft handling equipment removed and four tall radio antennas installed on her long, flat deck. in lieu of aircraft, the hangar deck now had no fewer than 24 military radio transmitter trucks bolted to its floor. rechristened , the ship was used as a communication relay ship and served dutifully through the vietnam war as a floating radio station, relaying transmissions between the forces on the ground and the command centers back home. like "thetis bay", the experience gained before "annapolis" was stricken in 1976 helped develop today′s purpose-built amphibious command ships of the .
unlike almost all other major classes of ships and patrol boats from world war ii, most of which can be found in a museum or port, no escort carrier or american light carrier has survived: all were destroyed during the war or broken up in the following decades. the dictionary of american naval fighting ships records that the last former escort carrier remaining in naval service — uss "annapolis" (ex- uss "gilbert islands") — was sold for scrapping 19 december 1979. the last american light carrier (the escort carrier′s faster sister type) was , which was broken up in 2002 after a decade-long attempt to preserve the vessel.
the u.s. designed the sea control ship to serve a similar role; whilst none were actually built, the spanish "principe de asturias" and the thai "chakri naruebet" are based on the concept.

action sports, adventure sports or extreme sports are activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk. these activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear.
the definition of extreme sports is not exact and the origin of the terms is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies to promote the x games and when the extreme sports channel and the extreme sports company launched. more recently, the commonly used definition from research is "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by dr. rhonda cohen (2012).
while use of the term "extreme sport" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. there are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports. while they are not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. extreme sports are also rarely sanctioned by schools for their physical education curriculum. extreme sports tend to be more solitary than many of the popular traditional sports (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams).
activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. these environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.
in a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. while it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as x games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. examples include changing snow conditions for snowboarders, rock and ice quality for climbers, and wave height and shape for surfers.
whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria. this results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.
while the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.
one argument is that to qualify as an "extreme sport" both expression terms need to be fulfilled;
along this definition, an activity such as bungee jumping may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). a passenger in a canyon jet boat ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. "thrill seeking" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than "extreme sport".
extreme sports may be subdivided into:
these sports require the use of snow, ice or water sports ("sports de glisse" in french) and rolling sports. another subdivision can be made along motorized and non motorized vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;
no vehicle is required (rock climbing, canyoning, ice climbing, parkour, deep-water soloing etc.)
the origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to ernest hemingway. the phrase is;
there are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.
the implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity in which one might be killed. the other activities being termed "games". the phrase may have been invented by either writer barnaby conrad or automotive author ken purdy.
the dangerous sports club of oxford university, england was founded by david kirke, chris baker, ed hulton and alan weston. they first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, by making the first modern jumps on 1 april 1979, from the clifton suspension bridge, bristol, england. they followed the clifton bridge effort with a jump from the golden gate bridge in san francisco, california (including the first female bungee jump by jane wilmot), and with a televised leap from the royal gorge suspension bridge in colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular american television program "that's incredible!" bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.
the club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at st. moritz, switzerland, in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. the event reached its limits when the club arrived in st. moritz with a london double-decker bus, wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the swiss resort managers refused.
other club activities included expedition hang gliding from active volcanoes; the launching of giant (60 ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre (zorbing); microlight flying; and base jumping (in the early days of this sport).
in recent decades the term "extreme sport" was further promoted after the extreme sports channel, extreme.com launched and then the x games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by espn. the first x games (known as 1995 extreme games) were held in newport, providence, mount snow, and vermont in the united states.
certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. for example, windsurfing was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a surfboard with a sailing boat's propulsion system (mast and sail). kitesurfing on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of kite buggying (a parafoil) with the bi-directional boards used for wakeboarding. wakeboarding is in turn derived from snowboarding and waterskiing.
some contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. for example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform stunts (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.
a feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an adrenaline rush in participants. however, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of dopamine, endorphins and serotonin because of the high level of physical exertion. furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative. the study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. this definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.
eric brymer also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. those experiences put the participants outside their comfort zone and are often done in conjunction with adventure travel.
some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. rock climbing and ice climbing have spawned publicly recognizable names such as edmund hillary, chris bonington, wolfgang güllich and more recently joe simpson. another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of hawaii.
disabled people participate in extreme sports. nonprofit organizations such as adaptive action sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as the x games.
extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. this imminent and inherent danger in an extreme sport has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal, which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.
extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average". these kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death. however, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.
health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. it is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.
mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.
physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.
extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline. this is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. however, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. it is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.

edith of england, also spelt eadgyth or ædgyth (, ; 910 – 26 january 946), a member of the house of wessex, was german queen from 936, by her marriage with king otto i.
edith was born to the reigning english king edward the elder by his second wife, ælfflæd, and hence was a granddaughter of king alfred the great. she had an older sister, eadgifu.
at the request of the east frankish king henry the fowler, who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two saxon kingdoms, her half-brother king æthelstan sent his sisters edith and edgiva to germany. henry's eldest son and heir to the throne otto was instructed to choose whichever one pleased him best. otto chose edith, according to hrotsvitha a woman "of pure noble countenance, graceful character and truly royal appearance", and married her in 930.
in 936 henry the fowler died and his eldest son otto, edith's husband, was crowned king at aachen cathedral. a surviving report of the ceremony by the medieval chronicler widukind of corvey makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to bishop thietmar of merseburg's chronicle, eadgyth was nevertheless anointed as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony.
as queen consort, edith undertook the usual state duties of a "first lady": when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the state's favoured monasteries or memorials to holy women and saints. in this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law, queen matilda, whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of eadgyth's time as queen. there was probably rivalry between the benedictine founded at magdeburg by otto and eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne, and matilda's foundation quedlinburg abbey, intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late king henry. edith accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles. while otto fought against the rebellious dukes eberhard of franconia and gilbert of lorraine in 939, she spent the hostilities at lorsch abbey.
like her brother, æthelstan, edith was devoted to the cult of their ancestor saint oswald of northumbria and was instrumental in introducing this cult into germany after her marriage to the emperor. her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in the duchy of saxony to be dedicated to this saint.
eadgyth's death in 946 at a relatively young age, in her thirties, was unexpected. otto apparently mourned the loss of a beloved spouse. he married adelaide of italy in 951.
edith and otto's children were:
both buried in st. alban's abbey, mainz.
initially buried in the st maurice monastery, edith's tomb since the 16th century has been located in magdeburg cathedral. long regarded as a cenotaph, a lead coffin inside a stone sarcophagus with her name on it was found and opened in 2008 by archaeologists during work on the building. an inscription recorded that it was the body of eadgyth, reburied in 1510. the fragmented and incomplete bones were examined in 2009, then brought to bristol, england, for tests in 2010.
the investigations at bristol, applying isotope tests on tooth enamel, checked whether she was born and brought up in wessex and mercia, as written history indicated. testing on the bones revealed that they are the remains of eadgyth, from study made of the enamel of the teeth in her upper jaw. testing of the enamel revealed that the individual entombed at magdeburg had spent time as a youth in the chalky uplands of wessex. the bones are the oldest found of a member of english royalty.
following the tests the bones were re-interred in a new titanium coffin in her tomb at magdeburg cathedral on 22 october 2010.


the kingdom of the east saxons (; ), today referred to as the kingdom of essex , was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the anglo-saxon heptarchy. it was founded in the 6th century and covered the territory later occupied by the counties of essex, hertfordshire, middlesex and (for a short while) kent. kings of essex were frequently subservient to foreign overlords. the last king of essex was sigered and in 825, he ceded the kingdom to ecgberht, king of wessex.
the kingdom was bounded to the north by the river stour and the kingdom of east anglia, to the south by the river thames and kent, to the east lay the north sea and to the west mercia. the territory included the remains of two provincial roman capitals, colchester and london. the early kingdom included the land of the middle saxons, later middlesex, most if not all of hertfordshire and may at times have included surrey. for a brief period in the 8th century, the kingdom of essex controlled what is now kent.
the modern english county of essex maintains the historic northern and the southern borders, but only covers the territory east of the river lea, the other parts being lost to neighbouring mercia during the 8th century.
in the tribal hidage it is listed as containing 7000 hides.
although the kingdom of essex was one of the kingdoms of the heptarchy, its history is not well documented. it produced relatively few anglo-saxon charters and no version of the "anglo-saxon chronicle"; in fact the only mention in the chronicle concerns bishop mellitus. as a result, the kingdom is regarded as comparatively obscure. for most of the kingdom's existence, the essex king was subservient to an overlord - variously the kings of kent, anglia or mercia.
saxon occupation of land that was to form the kingdom had begun by the early 5th century at mucking and other locations. a large proportion of these original settlers came from old saxony. according to british legend (see: historia brittonum) the territory known later as essex was ceded by the britons to the saxons following the infamous treachery of the long knives, which occurred ca. 460 during the reign of high king vortigern. della hooke relates the territory ruled by the kings of essex to the pre-roman territory of the trinovantes.
the kingdom of essex grew by the absorption of smaller subkingdoms or saxon tribal groups. there are a number of suggestions for the location of these subkingdoms including:
essex emerged as a single kingdom during the 6th century. the dates, names and achievements of the essex kings, like those of most early rulers in the heptarchy, remain conjectural. the historical identification of the kings of essex, including the evidence and a reconstructed genealogy are discussed extensively by yorke. the dynasty claimed descent from woden via seaxnēat. a genealogy of the essex royal house was prepared in wessex in the 9th century. unfortunately the surviving copy is somewhat mutilated. at times during the history of the kingdom several sub-kings within essex appear to have been able to rule simultaneously. they may have exercised authority over different parts of the kingdom. the first recorded king, according to the east saxon king list, was æscwine of essex, to which a date of 527 is given for the start of his reign, although there are some difficulties with the date of his reign, and sledd of essex is listed as the founder of the essex royal house by other sources.
the essex kings issued coins that echoed those issued by cunobeline simultaneously asserting a link to the first century rulers while emphasising independence from mercia.
the tomb of sæbbi of essex (r.664-683) was visible in old st paul's cathedral until the great fire of london of 1666 when the cathedral and the tombs within it were lost.
the earliest english record of the kingdom dates to bede's "historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum", which noted the arrival of bishop (later saint) mellitus in london in 604. æthelberht (king of kent and overlord of southern england according to bede) was in a position to exercise some authority in essex shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of king saebert of essex (son of sledd), his nephew, to christianity. it was æthelberht, and not sæberht, who built and endowed st. pauls in london, where st. paul’s cathedral now stands. bede describes æthelberht as sæberht’s overlord. after the death of saebert in ad 616, mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. this may have been the result of opposition to kentish influence in essex affairs rather than being specifically anti-christian.
the kingdom reconverted to christianity under sigeberht ii the good following a mission by st cedd who established monasteries at "tilaburg" (probably east tilbury, but possibly west tilbury) and "ithancester" (almost certainly bradwell-on-sea). a royal tomb at prittlewell was discovered and excavated in 2003. finds included gold foil crosses, suggesting the occupant was christian. if the occupant was a king, it was probably either saebert or sigeberht (murdered ad 653). it is, however, also possible that the occupant was not royal, but simply a wealthy and powerful individual whose identity has gone unrecorded.
essex reverted to paganism again in 660 with the ascension of the pagan king swithelm of essex. he converted in 662, but died in 664. he was succeeded by his two sons, sigehere and sæbbi. a plague the same year caused sigehere and his people to recant their christianity and essex reverted to paganism a third time. this rebellion was suppressed by wulfhere of mercia who established himself as overlord. bede describes sigehere and sæbbi as "rulers … under wulfhere, king of the mercians". wulfhere sent jaruman, the bishop of lichfield, to reconvert the east saxons.
wine (in 666) and erkenwald (in 675) were appointed bishops of london with spiritual authority over the east saxon kingdom. although london (and the rest of middlesex) was lost by the east saxons in the 8th century, the bishops of london continued to exert spiritual authority over essex as a kingdom, shire and county until 1845.
despite the comparative obscurity of the kingdom, there were strong connections between essex and the kentish kingdom across the river thames which led to the marriage of king sledd to ricula, sister of the king, aethelbert of kent. for a brief period in the 8th century the kingdom encompassed the kentish kingdom to the south. during this period, essex kings were issuing their own sceattas (coins), perhaps as an assertion of their own independence. however, by the mid 8th century much of the kingdom, including london, had fallen to mercia and the rump of essex, roughly the modern county, was now subordinate to the same. after the defeat of the mercian king beornwulf around ad 825, sigered, the last king of essex, ceded the kingdom which then became a possession of the wessex king egbert.
the mercians continued to control parts of essex and may have supported a pretender to the essex throne since a sigeric "rex orientalem saxonum" witnessed a mercian charter after ad 825. during the ninth century, essex was part of a sub-kingdom that included sussex, surrey and kent. sometime between 878 and 886, the territory was formally ceded by wessex to the danelaw kingdom of east anglia, under the treaty of alfred and guthrum. after the reconquest by edward the elder the king's representative in essex was styled an ealdorman and essex came to be regarded as a shire.

æthelberht (; also æthelbert, aethelberht, aethelbert or ethelbert; ; 550 – 24 february 616) was king of kent from about 589 until his death. the eighth-century monk bede, in his "ecclesiastical history of the english people", lists him as the third king to hold "imperium" over other anglo-saxon kingdoms. in the late ninth century "anglo-saxon chronicle", he is referred to as a bretwalda, or "britain-ruler". he was the first english king to convert to christianity.
æthelberht was the son of eormenric, succeeding him as king, according to the "chronicle". he married bertha, the christian daughter of charibert, king of the franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in contemporary western europe; the marriage probably took place before he came to the throne. bertha's influence may have led to pope gregory i's decision to send augustine as a missionary from rome. augustine landed on the isle of thanet in east kent in 597. shortly thereafter, æthelberht converted to christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to christianity began in the kingdom. he provided the new church with land in canterbury, thus establishing one of the foundation stones of what ultimately became the anglican communion.
æthelberht's law for kent, the earliest written code in any germanic language, instituted a complex system of fines; the law code is preserved in the textus roffensis. kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the continent, and æthelberht may have instituted royal control over trade. coinage probably began circulating in kent during his reign for the first time since the anglo-saxon settlement. he later came to be regarded as a saint for his role in establishing christianity among the anglo-saxons. his feast day was originally 24 february but was changed to 25 february.
in the fifth century, raids on britain by continental peoples had developed into full-scale migrations. the newcomers are known to have included angles, saxons, jutes and frisians, and there is evidence of other groups as well. these groups captured territory in the east and south of england, but at about the end of the fifth century, a british victory at the battle of mount badon (mons badonicus) halted the anglo-saxon advance for fifty years. from about 550, however, the british began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years it appears that control of almost all of southern england was in the hands of the invaders.
anglo-saxons probably conquered kent before mons badonicus. there is both documentary and archaeological evidence that kent was primarily colonised by jutes, from the southern part of the jutland peninsula. according to legend, the brothers hengist and horsa landed in 449 as mercenaries for a british king, vortigern. after a rebellion over pay and horsa's death in battle, hengist established the kingdom of kent. some historians now think the underlying story of a rebelling mercenary force may be accurate; most now date the founding of the kingdom of kent to the middle of the fifth-century, which is consistent with the legend. this early date, only a few decades after the departure of the romans, also suggests that more of roman civilization may have survived into anglo-saxon rule in kent than in other areas.
overlordship was a central feature of anglo-saxon politics which began before æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords as late as the ninth century. the anglo-saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; ælle of sussex may have been such a leader. once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. a weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.
sources for this period in kentish history include the "ecclesiastical history of the english people", written in 731 by bede, a northumbrian monk. bede was interested primarily in england's christianization. since æthelberht was the first anglo-saxon king to convert to christianity, bede provides more substantial information about him than about any earlier king. one of bede's correspondents was albinus, abbot of the monastery of st. peter and st. paul (subsequently renamed st. augustine's) in canterbury. the "anglo-saxon chronicle", a collection of annals assembled c. 890 in the kingdom of wessex, mentions several events in kent during æthelberht's reign. further mention of events in kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the franks by gregory of tours. this is the earliest surviving source to mention any anglo-saxon kingdom. some of pope gregory the great's letters concern the mission of st. augustine to kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of kent and its relationships with neighbours. other sources include regnal lists of the kings of kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). although no originals survive from æthelberht's reign, later copies exist. a law code from æthelberht's reign also survives.
according to bede, æthelberht was descended directly from hengist. bede gives the line of descent as follows: "ethelbert was son of irminric, son of octa, and after his grandfather oeric, surnamed oisc, the kings of the kentish folk are commonly known as oiscings. the father of oeric was hengist." an alternative form of this genealogy, found in the "historia brittonum" among other places, reverses the position of octa and oisc in the lineage. the first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable confidence is æthelberht's father, whose name now usually is spelled eormenric. the only direct written reference to eormenric is in kentish genealogies, but gregory of tours does mention that æthelberht's father was the king of kent, though gregory gives no date. eormenric's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the franks, across the english channel; the element "eormen" was rare in names of the anglo-saxon aristocracy, but much more common among frankish nobles. one other member of æthelberht's family is known: his sister, ricole, who is recorded by both bede and the "anglo-saxon chronicle" as the mother of sæberht, king of the east saxons (i.e., essex).
the dates of æthelberht's birth and accession to the throne of kent are both matters of debate. bede, the earliest source to give dates, is thought to have drawn his information from correspondence with albinus. bede states that when æthelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty-six years, placing his accession in 560. bede also says that æthelberht died twenty-one years after his baptism. augustine's mission from rome is known to have arrived in 597, and according to bede, it was this mission that converted æthelberht. hence bede's dates are inconsistent. the "anglo-saxon chronicle", an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. putting together the different dates in the "chronicle" for birth, death and length of reign, it appears that æthelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560–616 or 565–618 but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.
it is possible that æthelberht was converted to christianity before augustine's arrival. æthelberht's wife was a christian and brought a frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so æthelberht would have had knowledge of christianity before the mission reached kent. it also is possible that bede had the date of æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, æthelberht died in 618, this would be consistent with his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.
gregory of tours, in his "historia francorum", writes that bertha, daughter of charibert, king of the franks, married the son of the king of kent. bede says that æthelberht received bertha "from her parents". if bede is interpreted literally, the marriage would have had to take place before 567, when charibert died. the traditions for æthelberht's reign, then, would imply that æthelberht married bertha before either 560 or 565.
the extreme length of æthelberht's reign also has been regarded with skepticism by historians; it has been suggested that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. this would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. according to gregory of tours, charibert was king when he married ingoberg, bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. it therefore is unlikely that bertha was married much before about 580. these later dates for bertha and æthelberht also solve another possible problem: æthelberht's daughter, æthelburh, seems likely to have been bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have bertha aged sixty or so at æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.
gregory, however, also says that he thinks that ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married charibert. this is possible, but seems unlikely, especially as charibert seems to have had a preference for younger women, again according to gregory's account. this would imply an earlier birth date for bertha. on the other hand, gregory refers to æthelberht at the time of his marriage to bertha simply as "a man of kent", and in the 589 passage concerning ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to æthelberht as "the son of the king of kent". if this does not simply reflect gregory's ignorance of kentish affairs, which seems unlikely given the close ties between kent and the franks, then some assert that æthelberht's reign cannot have begun before 589.
while all of the contradictions above cannot be reconciled, the most probable dates that may be drawn from available data place æthelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to bertha at 580. his reign is most likely to have begun in 589 or 590.
the later history of kent shows clear evidence of a system of joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east kent and west kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. this evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son, eadbald. it may be that æthelberht was king of east kent and eadbald became king of west kent; the east kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in kentish history. whether or not eadbald became a joint king with æthelberht, there is no question that æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.
the division into two kingdoms is most likely to date back to the sixth century; east kent may have conquered west kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom. this was a common pattern in anglo-saxon england, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. an unusual feature of the kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.
the main towns of the two kingdoms were rochester, for west kent, and canterbury, for east kent. bede does not state that æthelberht had a palace in canterbury, but he does refer to canterbury as æthelberht's "metropolis", and it is clear that it is æthelberht's seat.
there are many indications of close relations between kent and the franks. æthelberht's marriage to bertha certainly connected the two courts, although not as equals: the franks would have thought of æthelberht as an under-king. there is no record that æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on the true nature of the relationship. evidence for an explicit frankish overlordship of kent comes from a letter written by pope gregory the great to theuderic, king of orléans, and theudebert, king of metz. the letter concerned augustine's mission to kent in 597, and in it gregory says that he believes "that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand". it may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. it also has been suggested that liudhard, bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the frankish church in kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.
a possible reason for the willingness of the franks to connect themselves with the kentish court is the fact that a frankish king, chilperic i, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the euthiones during the mid-sixth century. if, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the jutish invaders of kent, then it may be that the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and bertha were wed: it may be that frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.
regardless of the political relationship between æthelberht and the franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the english channel. there was a luxury trade between kent and the franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect frankish cultural influence. the kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods than those of the neighbouring anglo-saxon regions, which is not surprising given kent's easier access to trade across the english channel. in addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of kent. other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it is not necessary to presume that there was direct settlement by the franks in kent.
in his "ecclesiastical history", bede includes his list of seven kings who held "imperium" over the other kingdoms south of the humber. the usual translation for "imperium" is "overlordship". bede names æthelberht as the third on the list, after ælle of sussex and ceawlin of wessex. the anonymous annalist who composed one of the versions of the "anglo-saxon chronicle" repeated bede's list of seven kings in a famous entry under the year 827, with one additional king, egbert of wessex. the "chronicle" also records that these kings held the title ""bretwalda"", or "britain-ruler". the exact meaning of "bretwalda" has been the subject of much debate; it has been described as a term "of encomiastic poetry", but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.
the prior "bretwalda", ceawlin, is recorded by the "anglo-saxon chronicle" as having fought æthelberht in 568. the entry states that æthelberht lost the battle and was driven back to kent. the dating of the entries concerning the west saxons in this section of the "chronicle" is thought to be unreliable and a recent analysis suggests that ceawlin's reign is more likely to have been approximately 581–588, rather than the dates of 560–592 that are given in the "chronicle". the battle was at "wibbandun", which may be translated as wibba's mount; it is not known where this was.
at some point ceawlin ceased to hold the title of "bretwalda", perhaps after a battle at stoke lyne, in oxfordshire, which the "chronicle" dates to 584, some eight years before he was deposed in 592 (again using the "chronicle's" unreliable dating). æthelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601, when gregory the great wrote to him: gregory urges æthelberht to spread christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him, implying some level of overlordship. if the battle of wibbandun was fought c. 590, as has been suggested, then æthelberht must have gained his position as overlord at some time in the 590s. this dating for wibbandun is slightly inconsistent with the proposed dates of 581–588 for ceawlin's reign, but those dates are not thought to be precise, merely the most plausible given the available data.
in addition to the evidence of the "chronicle" that æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the heptarchy. in essex, æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of king sæberht of essex, his nephew, to christianity. it was æthelberht, and not sæberht, who built and endowed st. pauls in london, where st paul's cathedral now stands. further evidence is provided by bede, who explicitly describes æthelberht as sæberht's overlord.
bede describes æthelberht's relationship with rædwald, king of east anglia, in a passage that is not completely clear in meaning. it seems to imply that rædwald retained ducatus, or military command of his people, even while æthelberht held imperium. this implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that, since æthelberht is bretwalda despite rædwald's control of his own troops. rædwald was converted to christianity while in kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together with the fact that he retained military independence, implies that æthelberht's overlordship of east anglia was much weaker than his influence with the east saxons. an alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in bede should be translated as "rædwald, king of the east angles, who while æthelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people"; if this is bede's intent, then east anglia firmly was under æthelberht's overlordship.
there is no evidence that æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to christianity, although this is partly due to the lack of sources—nothing is known of sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the severn valley, on the northwestern borders of wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. no evidence survives showing kentish domination of mercia, but it is known that mercia was independent of northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under kentish overlordship.
the native britons had converted to christianity under roman rule. the anglo-saxon invasions separated the british church from european christianity for centuries, so the church in rome had no presence or authority in britain, and in fact, rome knew so little about the british church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. however, æthelberht would have known something about the roman church from his frankish wife, bertha, who had brought a bishop, liudhard, with her across the channel, and for whom æthelberht built a chapel, st martin's.
in 596, pope gregory the great sent augustine, prior of the monastery of st. andrew in rome, to england as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by augustine, landed on the isle of thanet in kent. according to bede, æthelberht was sufficiently distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky, to prevent them from performing sorcery. the monks impressed æthelberht, but he was not converted immediately. he agreed to allow the mission to settle in canterbury and permitted them to preach.
it is not known when æthelberht became a christian. it is possible, despite bede's account, that he already was a christian before augustine's mission arrived. it is likely that liudhard and bertha pressed æthelberht to consider becoming a christian before the arrival of the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of æthelberht's marriage to bertha was that æthelberht would consider conversion. conversion via the influence of the frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via roman influence might have been an assertion of independence from frankish control. it also has been argued that augustine's hesitation—he turned back to rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that æthelberht was a pagan at the time augustine was sent.
at the latest, æthelberht must have converted before 601, since that year gregory wrote to him as a christian king. an old tradition records that æthelberht converted on 1 june, in the summer of the year that augustine arrived. through æthelberht's influence sæberht, king of essex, also was converted, but there were limits to the effectiveness of the mission. the entire kentish court did not convert: eadbald, æthelberht's son and heir, was a pagan at his accession. rædwald, king of east anglia, was only partly converted (apparently while at æthelberht's court) and retained a pagan shrine next to the new christian altar. augustine also was unsuccessful in gaining the allegiance of the british clergy.
some time after the arrival of augustine's mission, perhaps in 602 or 603, æthelberht issued a set of laws, in ninety sections. these laws are by far the earliest surviving code composed in any of the germanic countries, and they were almost certainly among the first documents written down in anglo-saxon, as literacy would have arrived in england with augustine's mission. the only surviving early manuscript, the "textus roffensis", dates from the twelfth century, and it now resides in the medway studies centre in strood, kent. æthelberht's code makes reference to the church in the very first item, which enumerates the compensation required for the property of a bishop, a deacon, a priest, and so on; but overall, the laws seem remarkably uninfluenced by christian principles. bede asserted that they were composed "after the roman manner", but there is little discernible roman influence either. in subject matter, the laws have been compared to the lex salica of the franks, but it is not thought that æthelberht based his new code on any specific previous model.
the laws are concerned with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions at all levels of society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. the king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control. æthelberht's laws are mentioned by alfred the great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by æthelberht, as well as those of offa of mercia and ine of wessex.
one of æthelberht's laws seems to preserve a trace of a very old custom: the third item in the code states that "if the king is drinking at a man's home, and anyone commits any evil deed there, he is to pay twofold compensation." this probably refers to the ancient custom of a king traveling the country, being hosted, and being provided for by his subjects wherever he went. the king's servants retained these rights for centuries after æthelberht's time.
items 77–81 in the code have been interpreted as a description of a woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. these clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. it has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.
there is little documentary evidence about the nature of trade in æthelberht's kent. it is known that the kings of kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. there is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. it has been suggested that one of æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. the continental trade provided kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other anglo-saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.
kentish manufacture before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. kentish jewellers were highly skilled, and before the end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. goods from kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the loire. it is not known what kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. it may well be that this wealth was the foundation of æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.
it may have been during æthelberht's reign that the first coins were minted in england since the departure of the romans: none bear his name, but it is thought likely that the first coins predate the end of the sixth century. these early coins were gold, and probably were the shillings ( in old english) that are mentioned in æthelberht's laws. the coins are also known to numismatists as "thrymsas".
æthelberht died on 24 february 616 and was succeeded by his son, eadbald, who was not a christian—bede says he had been converted but went back to his pagan faith, although he ultimately did become a christian king. eadbald outraged the church by marrying his stepmother, which was contrary to church law, and by refusing to accept baptism. sæberht of the east saxons also died at approximately this time, and he was succeeded by his three sons, none of whom were christian. a subsequent revolt against christianity and the expulsion of the missionaries from kent may have been a reaction to kentish overlordship after æthelberht's death as much as a pagan opposition to christianity.
in addition to eadbald, it is possible that æthelberht had another son, æthelwald. the evidence for this is a papal letter to justus, archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625, that refers to a king named aduluald, who is apparently different from audubald, which refers to eadbald. there is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this: "aduluald" might be intended as a representation of "æthelwald", and hence an indication of another king, perhaps a sub-king of west kent; or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to eadbald.
æthelberht was later regarded as a saint for his role in establishing christianity among the anglo-saxons. his feast day was originally 24 february but was changed to 25 february. in the 2004 edition of the roman martyrology, he is listed under his date of death, 24 february, with the citation: 'king of kent, converted by st augustine, bishop, the first leader of the english people to do so'. the roman catholic archdiocese of southwark, which contains kent, commemorates him on 25 february. he is honoured together with his wife bertha on the liturgical calendar of the episcopal church on 27 may.
he is also venerated in the orthodox church as saint ethelbert the martyr and/or the king, his day commemorated on 25 february or 20 may/2 june.

erwin rudolf josef alexander schrödinger (, ; ; 12 august 1887 – 4 january 1961), sometimes written as ' or ', was a nobel prize-winning austrian physicist who developed a number of fundamental results in the field of quantum theory: the schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time.
in addition, he was the author of many works in various fields of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. in his book "what is life?" schrödinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. he paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion. he also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. he is also known for his "schrödinger's cat" thought-experiment.
on 12 august 1887, schrödinger was born in , vienna, austria, to (cerecloth producer, botanist) and georgine emilia brenda schrödinger (née bauer) (daughter of , professor of chemistry, tu wien). he was their only child.
his mother was of half austrian and half english descent; his father was catholic and his mother was lutheran. although he was raised in a religious household as a lutheran, he called himself an atheist. however, he had strong interests in eastern religions and pantheism, and he used religious symbolism in his works. he also believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead, albeit in a metaphorical sense.
he was also able to learn english outside school, as his maternal grandmother was british. between 1906 and 1910 schrödinger studied in vienna under franz s. exner (1849–1926) and friedrich hasenöhrl (1874–1915). he also conducted experimental work with karl wilhelm friedrich "fritz" kohlrausch.
in 1911, schrödinger became an assistant to exner. at an early age, schrödinger was strongly influenced by arthur schopenhauer. as a result of his extensive reading of schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in colour theory and philosophy. in his lecture "mind and matter", he said that "the world extended in space and time is but our representation." this is a repetition of the first words of schopenhauer's main work.
in 1914 erwin schrödinger achieved habilitation ("venia legendi"). between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the austrian fortress artillery (gorizia, duino, sistiana, prosecco, vienna). in 1920 he became the assistant to max wien, in jena, and in september 1920 he attained the position of ao. prof. ("ausserordentlicher professor"), roughly equivalent to reader (uk) or associate professor (us), in stuttgart. in 1921, he became o. prof. ("ordentlicher professor", i.e. full professor), in breslau (now wrocław, poland).
in 1921, he moved to the university of zürich. in 1927, he succeeded max planck at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin. in 1934 schrödinger decided to leave germany; he disliked the nazis' anti-semitism. he became a fellow of magdalen college at the university of oxford. soon after he arrived, he received the nobel prize together with paul dirac. his position at oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women, were not met with acceptance. in 1934, schrödinger lectured at princeton university; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem. he had the prospect of a position at the university of edinburgh but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the university of graz in austria in 1936. he had also accepted the offer of chair position at department of physics, allahabad university in india.
in the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with albert einstein, he proposed what is now called the schrödinger's cat thought experiment.
in 1938, after the anschluss, schrödinger had problems because of his flight from germany in 1933 and his known opposition to nazism. he issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so and explained the reason to einstein). however, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the university of graz dismissed him from his job for political unreliability. he suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to italy. from there, he went to visiting positions in oxford and ghent university.
in the same year he received a personal invitation from ireland's taoiseach, éamon de valera – a mathematician himself – to reside in ireland and agree to help establish an institute for advanced studies in dublin. he moved to clontarf, dublin, became the director of the school for theoretical physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. he became a naturalized irish citizen in 1948, but retained his austrian citizenship. he wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.
in 1944, he wrote "what is life?", which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex molecule with the genetic code for living organisms. according to james d. watson's memoir, "dna, the secret of life", schrödinger's book gave watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the discovery of the dna double helix structure in 1953. similarly, francis crick, in his autobiographical book "what mad pursuit", described how he was influenced by schrödinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.
schrödinger stayed in dublin until retiring in 1955. he had a lifelong interest in the vedanta philosophy of hinduism, which influenced his speculations at the close of "what is life?" about the possibility that individual consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the universe. a manuscript "fragment from an unpublished dialogue of galileo" from this time recently resurfaced at the king's hospital boarding school, dublin after it was written for the school's 1955 edition of their blue coat to celebrate his leaving of dublin to take up his appointment as chair of physics at the university of vienna.
in 1956, he returned to vienna (chair "ad personam"). at an important lecture during the world energy conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. during this period schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of wave–particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone, causing much controversy.
on 6 april 1920, schrödinger married annemarie (anny) bertel. schrödinger suffered from tuberculosis and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in arosa. it was there that he formulated his wave equation. as has been noted above, schrödinger had an unconventional personal life. when he migrated to ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, mrs. hilde march. march was the wife of an austrian colleague and schrödinger had fathered a daughter with her in 1934. schrödinger wrote personally to the taoiseach, éamon de valera, to obtain the visa for mrs. march. in october 1939 the "ménage à trois" duly took up residence in dublin. schrödinger fathered two further daughters by two different women during his time in ireland.
on 4 january 1961, schrödinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in vienna. he left anny a widow, and was buried in alpbach, austria, in a catholic cemetery. although he was not catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning schrödinger was a member of the pontifical academy of sciences. his wife, anny (born 3 december 1896) died on 3 october 1965. schrödinger's grandson, professor terry rudolph, has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at imperial college london.
early in his life, schrödinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher franz exner. he also studied vibrational theory, the theory of brownian movement, and mathematical statistics. in 1912, at the request of the editors of the "handbook of electricity and magnetism", schrödinger wrote an article titled "dieelectrism". that same year, schrödinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in august 1913 executed several experiments in zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of victor franz hess. for this work, schrödinger was awarded the 1920 haitinger prize (haitinger-preis) of the austrian academy of sciences. other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. the last work he performed together with his friend fritz kohlrausch. in 1919, schrödinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.
in the first years of his career schrödinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory, developed in the works of max planck, albert einstein, niels bohr, arnold sommerfeld, and others. this knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.
the first publications of schrödinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with sommerfeld and wolfgang pauli and his move to germany. in january 1921, schrödinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the bohr-sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. in autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician hermann weyl (1885–1955). this work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. earlier in the same year he created the schrödinger equation of the relativistic doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. he liked the idea of his teacher exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of bohr, kramers, and slater, which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). although the experiments of hans geiger and walther bothe soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for schrödinger and he discussed it in some reports and publications.
in january 1926, schrödinger published in "annalen der physik" the paper "" (quantization as an eigenvalue problem) on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the schrödinger equation. in this paper, he gave a "derivation" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. this paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. a second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new derivation of the schrödinger equation. a third paper, published in may, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of heisenberg and gave the treatment of the stark effect. a fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. in this paper he introduced a complex solution to the wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (this was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) when he introduced complex numbers in order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave mechanics was at his feet. (he eventually reduced the order to one.) these papers were his central achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.
schrödinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. he wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: "i don't like it, and i'm sorry i ever had anything to do with it." (just in order to ridicule the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics he contrived the famous thought-experiment called schrödinger's cat paradox.)
following his work on quantum mechanics, schrödinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified field theory that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of general relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with albert einstein. in 1947, he announced a result, "affine field theory," in a talk at the royal irish academy, but the announcement was criticized by einstein as "preliminary" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory. following the failure of his attempt at unification, schrödinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics.
schrödinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular colour perception and colorimetry (german: ""). he spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:
his work on the psychology of colour perception follows the step of newton, maxwell and von helmholtz in the same area. some of these papers have been translated into english and can be found in: "sources of colour science", ed. david l. macadam, mit press (1970).
the philosophical issues raised by schrödinger's cat are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in popular science, while schrödinger's equation is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. to this day, schrödinger is known as "the father of quantum mechanics". the large crater schrödinger, on the far side of the moon, is named after him. the erwin schrödinger international institute for mathematical physics was established in vienna in 1993.
schrödinger's portrait was the main feature of the design of the 1983–97 austrian 1000-schilling banknote, the second-highest denomination.
a building is named after him at the university of limerick, in limerick, ireland, as is the 'erwin schrödinger zentrum' at adlershof in berlin.
schrödinger's 126th birthday anniversary in 2013 was celebrated with a google doodle.
schrödinger's cat is named in his honour, see also: list of things named after erwin schrödinger.

easywriter was a word processor first written for the apple ii series computer in 1979, the first word processor for that platform.
published by information unlimited software (ius), it was written by john draper's cap'n software, which also produced a version of forth, which easywriter was developed in. draper developed easywriter while serving nights in the alameda county jail under a work furlough program.
it was later ported to the ibm pc and released with the new computer in august 1981 as a launch title. many criticized easywriter 1.0, distributed by ibm, for being buggy and hard to use; "pc magazine" told the company as early as december 1981 that subscribers "wish ibm had provided better word processing". the company quickly persuaded ius to develop a new version. (when founder william baker later sent "i survived easywriter" t-shirts, ibm returned them stating that it did not accept gifts.) ibm offered a free upgrade to version 1.10 to version 1.0 owners, but easywriter's poor quality had caused others to quickly provide alternatives, such as camilo wilson's volkswriter.
ius released a separate application, easywriter ii. completely rewritten by basic software group, ius emphasized that ii—developed with c instead of forth—"is not an updated version of the original ibm selection or its upgrade".
"byte" in 1981 reviewed easywriter and easywriter professional for the apple ii, stating that "editing is a pleasure with either version", and approving of their features, user interface, and documentation. in an early review of the ibm pc, however, the magazine in 1982 stated that easywriter for it or the apple ii "didn't seem to be of the same caliber as, say, visicalc or the peachtree business packages", citing the lack of ease of use and slow scrolling as flaws, and advised those who planned to use the ibm pc primarily for word processing to buy another computer until alternative software became available. andrew fluegelman wrote in "pc magazine" that although easywriter 1.0 appeared to be an easy-to-use word processor for casual users, it "contains a few very annoying inconveniences and some very serious traps". he cited several bugs, slow performance, and user-interface issues, and later called it "pretty much a lemon".
ibm's don estridge admitted in 1983 that he "tried to use easywriter 1.0 and had the same experience everybody else had". easywriter 1.10 resolved most of fluegelman's complaints. he reported that it "performs smoothly, will handle most any routine writing and printing job, and is easy to learn and operate", and that if ibm had released 1.10 first easywriter would likely have become the standard pc word processor.
"byte" criticized easywriter ii for running as a booter instead of using dos, requiring specially formatted disks for storage and a utility to convert to dos-formatted disks, not being compatible with double-sided drives, and using a heavily modal editing interface.

edward vincent sullivan (september 28, 1901 – october 13, 1974) was an american television personality, sports and entertainment reporter, and syndicated columnist for the "new york daily news" and the chicago tribune new york news syndicate. he is principally remembered as the creator and host of the television variety program "the toast of the town", later popularly—and, eventually, officially—renamed "the ed sullivan show". broadcast for 23 years from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in us broadcast history. "it was, by almost any measure, the last great tv show," said television critic david hinckley. "it's one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories."
sullivan was a broadcasting pioneer at many levels during television's infancy. as tv critic david bianculli wrote, "before mtv, sullivan presented rock acts. before bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. before the comedy channel, even before there was "the tonight show", sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. before there were 500 channels, before there was cable, ed sullivan was where the choice was. from the start, he was indeed 'the toast of the town'." in 1996, sullivan was ranked number 50 on "tv guide"'s "50 greatest tv stars of all time".
edward vincent sullivan was born on september 28, 1901 in harlem, new york city, the son of elizabeth f. (née smith) and peter arthur sullivan, a customs house employee, and grew up in port chester, new york. he was of irish descent. the entire family loved music, and someone was always playing the piano or singing. a phonograph was a prized possession; the family loved playing all types of records on it. sullivan was a gifted athlete in high school, earning 12 athletic letters at port chester high school. he played halfback in football; he was a guard in basketball; in track he was a sprinter. with the baseball team, sullivan was catcher and team captain, and he led the team to several championships. baseball made an impression on him that would affect his career as well as the culture of america. sullivan noted that, in the state of new york, regarding high school sports, then integration was taken for granted: "when we went up into connecticut, we ran into clubs that had negro players. in those days this was accepted as commonplace; and so, my instinctive antagonism years later to any theory that a negro wasn't a worthy opponent or was an inferior person. it was just as simple as that."
sullivan landed his first job at "the port chester daily item", a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school and then joined the paper full-time after graduation. in 1919, he joined "the hartford post". the newspaper folded in his first week there, but he landed another job on "the new york evening mail" as a sports reporter. after "the evening mail" closed in 1923, he bounced through a series of news jobs with the associated press, "the philadelphia bulletin", "the morning world", "the morning telegraph", "the new york bulletin" and "the leader". finally, in 1927, sullivan joined "the evening graphic" as first sports writer and then sports editor. in 1929, when walter winchell moved to "the daily mirror", sullivan was made broadway columnist. his theatre column was later carried in the "new york daily news". his column, "little old new york", concentrated on broadway shows and gossip, as winchell's had; and, like winchell, he did show-business news broadcasts on radio. again echoing winchell, sullivan took on yet another medium in 1933 by writing and starring in the film "mr. broadway", which has him guiding the audience around new york nightspots to meet entertainers and celebrities. sullivan soon became a powerful starmaker in the entertainment world himself, becoming one of winchell's main rivals, setting the el morocco nightclub in new york as his unofficial headquarters against winchell's seat of power at the nearby stork club. sullivan continued writing for "the news" throughout his broadcasting career, and his popularity long outlived winchell's.
throughout his career as a columnist, sullivan had dabbled in entertainment—producing vaudeville shows with which he appeared as master of ceremonies in the 1920s and 1930s, directing a radio program over the original wabc (now wcbs) and organizing benefit reviews for various causes.
in 1941, sullivan was host of the "summer silver theater", a variety program on cbs, with will bradley as bandleader and a guest star featured each week.
in 1948, marlo lewis, a producer, got the cbs network to hire sullivan to do a weekly sunday-night tv variety show, "toast of the town", which later became "the ed sullivan show". debuting in june 1948, the show was originally broadcast from the maxine elliott theatre on west 39th street in new york city. in january 1953, it moved to cbs-tv studio 50, at 1697 broadway (at 53rd street) in new york city, which in 1967 was renamed the ed sullivan theater (and was later the home of the "late show with david letterman" and "the late show with stephen colbert"). studio 50 was formerly a cbs radio studio, from 1936 to 1953, and before that was the legitimate hammerstein theatre, built in 1927.
television critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews. harriet van horne alleged that "he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having "no" personality." (the host wrote to the critic, "dear miss van horne: you bitch. sincerely, ed sullivan.") sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, 20 years after his show's debut, "time" magazine asked, "what exactly is ed sullivan's talent?" his mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from bell's palsy. "time" in 1955 stated that sullivan resembled
the magazine concluded, however, that "yet, instead of frightening children, ed sullivan charms the whole family." sullivan appeared to the audience as an average guy who brought the great acts of show business to their home televisions. "ed sullivan will last", comedian fred allen said, "as long as someone else has talent", and frequent guest alan king said, "ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television." he had a newspaperman's instinct for what the public wanted, and programmed his variety hours with remarkable balance. there was something for everyone. a typical show would feature a vaudeville act (acrobats, jugglers, magicians, etc.), one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a hot jukebox favorite, a figure from the legitimate theater, and for the kids, a visit with puppet "topo gigio, the little italian mouse", or a popular athlete. the bill was often international in scope, with many european performers augmenting the american artists.
sullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted—even encouraged—impersonators such as john byner, frank gorshin, rich little, and especially will jordan to imitate him on his show. johnny carson also did a fair impression, and even joan rivers imitated sullivan's unique posture. the impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as "and now, right here on our stage...", "for all you youngsters out there...", and "a really big shew" (his pronunciation of the word "show"). will jordan portrayed sullivan in the films "i wanna hold your hand", "the buddy holly story", "the doors", "mr. saturday night", "down with love", and in the 1979 tv movie "elvis".
sullivan inspired a song in the musical "bye bye birdie", and in 1963, appeared as himself in the film.
in 1954, sullivan was a co-host on a memorable tv musical special, "".
in the 1950s and 1960s, sullivan was a respected starmaker because of the number of performers who became household names after appearing on the show. he had a knack for identifying and promoting top talent and paid a great deal of money to secure that talent for his show. sullivan was quoted as saying "in the conduct of my own show, i've never asked a performer his religion, his race or his politics. performers are engaged on the basis of their abilities. i believe that this is another quality of our show that has helped win it a wide and loyal audience."
although sullivan was wary of elvis presley's "bad boy" image, and initially said that he would never book him, presley became too big a name to ignore; in 1956, sullivan signed him for three appearances. in august 1956, sullivan was injured in an automobile accident near his country home in southbury, connecticut, and missed presley's first appearance on september 9. charles laughton wound up introducing presley on the sullivan hour. when ed returned to the show, audiences noticed a change in his voice. after sullivan got to know presley personally, he made amends by telling his audience, "this is a real decent, fine boy."
sullivan's failure to scoop the tv industry with presley made him determined to get the next big sensation first. in november 1963, while in heathrow airport, sullivan witnessed beatlemania as the band returned from sweden. at first he was reluctant to book the beatles because the band did not have a commercially successful single released in the us at the time, but at the behest of a friend, legendary impresario sid bernstein, sullivan signed the group. their initial sullivan show appearance on february 9, 1964, was the most-watched program in tv history to that point, and remains one of the most-watched programs of all time. the beatles appeared three more times in person, and submitted filmed performances later. the dave clark five, who claimed a "cleaner" image than the beatles, made 13 appearances on the show, more than any other uk group.
unlike many shows of the time, sullivan asked that most musical acts perform their music live, rather than lip-synching to their recordings. examination of performances show that exceptions were made, as when a microphone could not be placed close enough to a performer for technical reasons. an example was b.j. thomas' 1969 performance of "raindrops keep fallin' on my head", in which actual water was sprinkled on him as a special effect. in 1969, sullivan presented the jackson 5 with their first single "i want you back", which ousted the b.j. thomas song from the top spot of "billboard's" pop charts.
sullivan appreciated african american talent. according to biographer gerald nachman, "most tv variety shows welcomed 'acceptable' black superstars like louis armstrong, pearl bailey and sammy davis jr. ... but in the early 1950s, long before it was fashionable, sullivan was presenting the much more obscure black entertainers he had enjoyed in harlem on his uptown rounds — legends like peg leg bates, pigmeat markham and tim moore ... strangers to white america." he hosted pioneering tv appearances by bo diddley, the platters, brook benton, jackie wilson, fats domino, and numerous motown acts, including the supremes, who appeared 17 times. as the critic john leonard wrote, "there wasn't an important black artist who didn't appear on ed's show."
he defied pressure to exclude african american entertainers, and to avoid interacting with them when they did appear. "sullivan had to fend off his hard-won sponsor, ford's lincoln dealers, after kissing pearl bailey on the cheek and daring to shake nat king cole's hand," nachman wrote. according to biographer jerry bowles, "sullivan once had a ford executive thrown out of the theatre when he suggested that sullivan stop booking so many black acts. and a dealer in cleveland told him 'we realize that you got to have niggers on your show. but do you have to put your arm around bill 'bojangles' robinson at the end of his dance?' sullivan had to be physically restrained from beating the man to a pulp." sullivan later raised money to help pay for robinson's funeral. "as a catholic, it was inevitable that i would despise intolerance, because catholics suffered more than their share of it," he told an interviewer. "as i grew up, the causes of minorities were part and parcel of me. negroes and jews were the minority causes closest at hand. i need no urging to take a plunge in and help."
at a time when television had not yet embraced country and western music, sullivan featured nashville performers on his program. this, in turn, paved the way for shows such as "hee haw", and variety shows hosted by johnny cash, glen campbell, and other country singers. the act that appeared most frequently through the show's run was the canadian comedy duo of wayne & shuster, who made 67 appearances between 1958 and 1969.
sullivan appeared as himself on other television programs, including an april 1958 episode of the howard duff and ida lupino cbs sitcom, "mr. adams and eve". on september 14, 1958, sullivan appeared on "what's my line?" as a mystery guest, and showed his comedic side by donning a rubber mask. in 1961, sullivan was asked by cbs to fill in for an ailing red skelton on "the red skelton show". sullivan took skelton's roles in the various comedy sketches; skelton's hobo character "freddie the freeloader" was renamed "eddie the freeloader."
sullivan was quick to take offense if he felt that he had been crossed, and he could hold a grudge for a long time. as he told biographer gerald nachman, "i'm a pop-off. i flare up, then i go around apologizing." "armed with an irish temper and thin skin," wrote nachman, "ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his coverage of, and devotion to, boxing." bo diddley, buddy holly, jackie mason, and jim morrison were parties to some of sullivan's most storied conflicts.
for his second sullivan appearance in 1955, bo diddley planned to sing his namesake hit, "bo diddley", but sullivan told him to perform tennessee ernie ford's song "sixteen tons". "that would have been the end of my career right there," he told his biographer, so he sang "bo diddley" anyway. sullivan was enraged: "you're the first black boy that ever double-crossed me on the show," diddley quoted him as saying. "we didn't have much to do with each other after that." later, diddley resented that elvis presley, whom he accused of copying his revolutionary style and beat, received the attention and accolades on sullivan's show that he felt were rightfully his. "i am owed," he said, "and i never got paid." "he might have," wrote nachman, "had things gone smoother with sullivan."
buddy holly and the crickets first appeared on the sullivan show in 1957 to an enthusiastic response. for their second appearance in january 1958, sullivan considered the lyrics of their chosen number "oh, boy!" too suggestive, and ordered holly to substitute another song. holly responded that he had already told his hometown friends in texas that he would be singing "oh, boy!" for them. sullivan, unaccustomed to having his instructions questioned, angrily repeated them, but holly refused to back down. later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, sullivan commented, "i guess the crickets are not too excited to be on "the ed sullivan show"." holly, still annoyed by sullivan's attitude, replied, "i hope they're damn more excited than i am." sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced holly's name during the introduction. he also saw to it that holly's guitar amplifier was turned off. nevertheless, the band was received so well that sullivan was forced to invite them back; holly responded that sullivan did not have enough money. archival photographs taken during the appearance show holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry sullivan.
during jackie mason's october 1964 performance on a show that had been shortened by ten minutes due to an address by president lyndon johnson, sullivan—on-stage but off-camera—signaled mason that he had two minutes left by holding up two fingers. sullivan's signal distracted the studio audience, and to television viewers unaware of the circumstances, it seemed as though mason's jokes were falling flat. mason, in a bid to regain the audience's attention, cried, "i'm getting fingers here!" and made his own frantic hand gesture: "here's a finger for you!" videotapes of the incident are inconclusive as to whether mason's upswept hand (which was just off-camera) was intended to be an indecent gesture, but sullivan was convinced that it was, and banned mason from future appearances on the program. mason later insisted that he did not know what the "middle finger" meant, and that he did not make the gesture anyway. in september 1965, sullivan—who, according to mason, was "deeply apologetic"—brought mason on the show for a "surprise grand reunion". "he said they were old pals," nachman wrote, "news to mason, who never got a repeat invitation." mason added that his earning power "...was cut right in half after that. i never really worked my way back until i opened on broadway in 1986."
when the byrds performed on december 12, 1965, david crosby got into a shouting match with the show's director. they were never asked to return.
sullivan decided that "girl, we couldn't get much higher", from the doors' signature song "light my fire", was too overt a reference to drug use, and directed that the lyric be changed to "girl, we couldn't get much better" for the group's september 1967 appearance. the band members "nodded their assent", according to doors biographer ben fong-torres, then sang the song as written. after the broadcast, producer bob precht told the group, "mr. sullivan wanted you for six more shows, but you'll never work "the ed sullivan show" again." jim morrison replied, "hey, man, we just "did" the "ed sullivan show"." sullivan, true to his word, never invited the band back but to his dismay, this was the launching pad for the psychedelic group.
the rolling stones famously capitulated during their fifth appearance on the show, in 1967, when mick jagger was told to change the titular lyric of "let's spend the night together" to "let's spend some time together". "but jagger prevailed," wrote nachman, by deliberately calling attention to the censorship, rolling his eyes, mugging, and drawing out the word "t-i-i-i-me" as he sang the revised lyric. sullivan was angered by the insubordination, but the stones did make one additional appearance on the show, in 1969.
moe howard of the three stooges recalled in 1975 that sullivan had a memory problem of sorts: "ed was a very nice man, but for a showman, quite forgetful. on our first appearance, he introduced us as the three ritz brothers. he got out of it by adding, 'who look more like the three stooges to me'." joe derita, who worked with the stooges after 1959, had commented that sullivan had a personality "like the bottom of a bird cage."
diana ross, who was very fond of sullivan, later recalled sullivan's forgetfulness during the many occasions the supremes performed on his show. in a 1995 appearance on the "late show with david letterman" (taped in the ed sullivan theater), ross stated, "he could never remember our names. he called us 'the girls'."
in a 1990 press conference, paul mccartney recalled meeting sullivan again in the early 1970s. sullivan apparently had no idea who mccartney was. mccartney tried to remind sullivan that he was one of the beatles, but sullivan obviously could not remember, and nodding and smiling, simply shook mccartney's hand and left. in an interview with howard stern around 2012, joan rivers said that sullivan had been suffering from dementia toward the end of his life.
sullivan, like many american entertainers, was pulled into the cold war anticommunism of the late 1940s and 1950s. tap dancer paul draper's scheduled january 1950 appearance on "toast of the town" met with opposition from hester mccullough, an activist in the hunt for "subversives". branding draper a communist party "sympathizer", she demanded that sullivan's lead sponsor, the ford motor company, cancel draper's appearance. draper denied the charge, and appeared on the show as scheduled. ford received over a thousand angry letters and telegrams, and sullivan was obliged to promise ford's advertising agency, kenyon & eckhardt, that he would avoid controversial guests going forward. draper was forced to move to europe to earn a living.
after the draper incident, sullivan began to work closely with theodore kirkpatrick of the anticommunist "counterattack" newsletter. he would consult kirkpatrick if any questions came up regarding a potential guest's political leanings. sullivan wrote in his june 21, 1950, "daily news" column that "kirkpatrick has sat in my living room on several occasions and listened attentively to performers eager to secure a certification of loyalty."
cold war repercussions manifested in a different way when bob dylan was booked to appear in may 1963. his chosen song was "talkin' john birch paranoid blues", which poked fun at the ultraconservative john birch society and its tendency to see communist conspiracies in many situations. no concern was voiced by anyone, including sullivan, during rehearsals, but on the day of the broadcast, cbs's standards and practices department rejected the song, fearing that lyrics equating the society's views with those of adolf hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit. dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice, he would rather not appear at all. the story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; sullivan denounced the network's decision in published interviews.
sullivan butted heads with standards and practices on other occasions, as well. in 1956, ingrid bergman—who had been living in "exile" in europe since 1950 in the wake of her scandalous love affair with director roberto rossellini while they were both married—was planning a return to hollywood as the star of "anastasia". sullivan, confident that the american public would welcome her back, invited her to appear on his show and flew to europe to film an interview with bergman, yul brynner, and helen hayes on the "anastasia" set. when he arrived back in new york, standards and practices informed sullivan that under no circumstances would bergman be permitted to appear on the show, either live or on film. sullivan's prediction later proved correct, as bergman won her second academy award for her portrayal, as well as the forgiveness of her fans.
sullivan was engaged to champion swimmer sybil bauer, but she died of cancer in 1927 at the age of 23. in 1926, sullivan met and began dating sylvia weinstein. weinstein tried to tell her jewish family she was dating a man named ed solomon, but her brother figured out she meant ed sullivan. with both families strongly opposed to a catholic–jewish marriage, the affair was on-again-off-again for three years. they were finally married on april 28, 1930, in a city hall ceremony, and a year later sylvia gave birth to elizabeth ("betty"), named after sullivan's mother, who had died that year.
the sullivans were always "on the town", eating out five nights a week at some of the trendiest clubs and restaurants including the stork club, danny's hideaway and jimmy kelly's. sullivan socialized with the rich and famous, was friends with u.s. presidents and was given audiences with various popes. in 1952, betty sullivan married the "ed sullivan show"'s producer, bob precht. from the prechts, ed had five grandchildren—robert edward, carla elizabeth, vincent henry, andrew sullivan and margo elizabeth. the sullivan and precht families were very close; betty died on june 7, 2014, aged 83. the sullivans rented a suite of rooms at the hotel delmonico in 1944 after living at the hotel astor on times square for many years. sullivan rented a suite next door to the family suite, which he used as an office until "the ed sullivan show" was canceled in 1971. sullivan was in the habit of calling his wife after every program to get her immediate critique.
in the fall of 1965, cbs began televising its weekly programs in color. although the sullivan show was seen live in the central and eastern time zones, it was taped for airing in the pacific and mountain time zones. most of the taped programs, as well as some early kinescopes, were preserved, and excerpts have been released on home video.
by 1971, the show's ratings had plummeted. in an effort to refresh its lineup, cbs canceled the program along with some of its other longtime shows (later known as the rural purge). sullivan was angered and refused to do a final show, although he remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in june 1973.
in early september 1974, x-rays revealed that sullivan had an advanced growth of esophageal cancer. doctors gave him very little time to live, and the family chose to keep the diagnosis secret from him. sullivan, still believing his ailment to be yet another complication from a long-standing battle with gastric ulcers, died five weeks later on october 13, 1974, at new york's lenox hill hospital; he was 73 years old. his funeral was attended by 3,000 at st. patrick's cathedral, new york, on a cold, rainy day. sullivan is interred in a crypt at the ferncliff cemetery in hartsdale, new york.
sullivan has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at 6101 hollywood blvd.

élisabeth louise vigée le brun (16 april 1755 – 30 march 1842), also known as madame lebrun or madame le brun, was a prominent french portrait painter of the late eighteenth century.
her artistic style is generally considered part of the aftermath of rococo with elements of an adopted neoclassical style. her subject matter and color palette can be classified as rococo, but her style is aligned with the emergence of neoclassicism. vigée le brun created a name for herself in ancien régime society by serving as the portrait painter to marie antoinette. she enjoyed the patronage of european aristocrats, actors, and writers, and was elected to art academies in ten cities.
vigée le brun created some 660 portraits and 200 landscapes. in addition to many works in private collections, her paintings are owned by major museums, such as the louvre, hermitage museum, national gallery in london, metropolitan museum of art in new york, and many other collections in continental europe and the united states.
born in paris on 16 april 1755, élisabeth louise vigée was the daughter of a portraitist and fan painter, louis vigée, from whom she received her first instruction. her mother, jeanne (née maissin) (1728–1800), was a hairdresser. in 1760, at the age of five, she entered a convent, where she remained until 1766. her father died when she was twelve years old. in 1768, her mother married a wealthy jeweler, jacques-françois le sèvre, and shortly after, the family moved to the rue saint-honoré, close to the palais royal. in her memoir, vigée le brun directly stated her feelings about her step-father: "i hated this man; even more so since he made use of my father's personal possessions. he wore his clothes, just as they were, without altering them to fit his figure." during this period, élisabeth benefited from the advice of gabriel françois doyen, jean-baptiste greuze, and joseph vernet, whose influence is evident in her portrait of her younger brother, étienne vigée (1773).
by the time she was in her early teens, élisabeth was painting portraits professionally. after her studio was seized for her practicing without a license, she applied to the académie de saint-luc, which unwittingly exhibited her works in their salon. in 1774, she was made a member of the académie. on 11 january 1776 she married jean-baptiste-pierre le brun, a painter and art dealer. vigée le brun began exhibiting her work at their home in paris, the hôtel de lubert, and the salons she held here supplied her with many new and important contacts. her husband's great-great-uncle was charles le brun, the first director of the french academy under louis xiv. vigée le brun painted portraits of many of the nobility.
on 12 february 1780, vigée-le brun gave birth to a daughter, jeanne lucie louise, whom she called julie and nicknamed "brunette."
in 1781 she and her husband toured flanders and the netherlands, where seeing the works of the flemish masters inspired her to try new techniques. her "self-portrait with straw hat" (1782) was a "free imitation" of peter paul rubens' "la chapeau de paille" (ca. 1622–25). dutch and flemish influences have also been noted in "the comte d'espagnac" (1786) and "madame perregaux" (1789).
in 1787, she caused a minor public scandal when her "self-portrait with her daughter julie" (1787) was exhibited at the salon of 1787 showing her smiling and open-mouthed, which was in direct contravention of traditional painting conventions going back to antiquity. the court gossip-sheet "mémoires secrets" commented: "an affectation which artists, art-lovers and persons of taste have been united in condemning, and which finds no precedent among the ancients, is that in smiling, [madame vigée lebrun] shows her teeth." in light of this and her other "self-portrait with her daughter julie" (1789), simone de beauvoir dismissed vigée le brun as narcissistic in "the second sex" (1949): "madame vigée-lebrun never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases."
as her career blossomed, vigée le brun was granted patronage by marie antoinette. she painted more than thirty portraits of the queen and her family, leading to the common perception that she was the official portraitist of marie antoinette. at the salon of 1783, vigée le brun exhibited "marie-antoinette in a muslin dress" (1783), sometimes called "marie-antoinette en gaulle", in which the queen chose to be shown in a simple, informal white cotton garment. the resulting scandal was prompted by both the informality and the queen's decision to be shown in that way. vigée le brun's later "marie-antoinette and her children" (1787) was evidently an attempt to improve the queen's image by making her more relatable to the public, in the hopes of countering the bad press and negative judgments that the queen had recently received. the portrait shows the queen at home in the palace of versailles, engaged in her official function as the mother of the king's children, but also suggests marie-antoinette's uneasy identity as a foreign-born queen whose maternal role was her only true function under salic law.
on 31 may 1783, vigée le brun was received as a member of the académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. she was one of only fifteen women to be granted full membership in the académie between 1648 and 1793. her rival, adélaïde labille-guiard, was admitted on the same day. vigée le brun was initially refused on the grounds that her husband was an art dealer, but eventually the académie was overruled by an order from louis xvi because marie antoinette put considerable pressure on her husband on behalf of her portraitist. as her reception piece, vigée le brun submitted an allegorical painting, "peace bringing back abundance" ("la paix ramenant l'abondance"), instead of a portrait. as a consequence, the académie did not place her work within a standard category of painting—either history or portraiture. vigée le brun's membership in the académie dissolved after the french revolution because female academicians were abolished.
in october 1789, after the arrest of the royal family during the french revolution, vigée le brun fled france with her young daughter, julie. her husband, who remained in paris, claimed that vigée le brun went to italy "to instruct and improve herself", but she certainly feared for her own safety. in her twelve-year absence from france, she lived and worked in italy (1789–92), austria (1792–95), russia (1795–1801), and germany (1801).
while in italy, vigée le brun was elected to the academy in parma (1789) and the accademia di san luca in rome (1790). in naples, she painted portraits of maria carolina of austria (sister of marie antoinette) and her eldest four living children: maria teresa, francesco, luisa, and maria cristina. she later recalled that luisa "was extremely ugly, and pulled such faces that i was most reluctant to finish her portrait." vigée le brun also painted allegorical portraits of the notorious emma hamilton as ariadne (1790) and as a bacchante (ca. 1792). lady hamilton was similarly the model for vigée le brun's "sibyl" (1792), which was inspired by the painted sibyls of domenichino. the painting represents the cumaean sibyl, as indicated by the greek inscription on the figure's scroll, which is taken from virgil's fourth eclogue. the "sibyl" was vigée le brun's favorite painting. it is mentioned in her memoir more than any other work. she displayed it while in venice (1792), vienna (1792), dresden (1794), and saint petersburg (1795); she also sent it to be shown at the salon of 1798. like her reception piece, "peace bringing back abundance" (1783), vigée le brun regarded her "sibyl" as a history painting, the most elevated category in the académie's hierarchy.
while in vienna, vigée le brun was commissioned to paint "princess maria josefa hermengilde von esterhazy as ariadne" (1793) and its pendant "princess karoline von liechtenstein as iris" (1793). the portraits depict the liechtenstein sisters-in-law in unornamented roman-inspired garments that show the influence of neoclassicism, and which may have been a reference to the virtuous republican roman matron cornelia, mother of the gracchi.
in russia, where she stayed from 1795 until 1801, she was received by the nobility and painted numerous aristocrats, including the last king of poland, stanisław august poniatowski, and members of the family of catherine the great. although the french aesthetic was widely admired in russia, there remained various cultural differences as to what was deemed acceptable. catherine was not initially happy with vigée le brun's portrait of her granddaughters, elena and alexandra pavlovna, due to the amount of bare skin the short-sleeved gowns revealed. in order to please the empress, vigée le brun added sleeves. this tactic seemed effective in pleasing catherine, as she agreed to sit herself for vigée le brun (although catherine died of a stroke before this work was due to begin). while in russia, vigée le brun was made a member of the academy of fine arts of saint petersburg. much to vigée le brun's dismay, her daughter julie married gaétan bernard nigris, secretary to the director of the imperial theaters of saint petersburg.
after a sustained campaign by her ex-husband and other family members to have her name removed from the list of counter-revolutionary émigrés, vigée le brun was finally able to return to france in january 1802. she travelled to london in 1803, to switzerland in 1807, and to switzerland again in 1808. in geneva, she was made an honorary member of the société pour l'avancement des beaux-arts. she stayed at coppet with madame de staël, who appears as the title character in "corinne, ou l'italie" (1807).
in her later years, vigée le brun purchased a house in louveciennes, île-de-france, and divided her time between louveciennes and paris. she died in paris on 30 march 1842, aged 86. she was buried at the cimetière de louveciennes near her old home. her tombstone epitaph says ""ici, enfin, je repose..."" (here, at last, i rest...).
between 1835 and 1837, when vigée le brun was in her eighties, she published her memoirs in three volumes ("souvenirs").
during her lifetime, vigée le brun's work was publicly exhibited in paris at the académie de saint-luc (1774), salon de la correspondance (1779, 1781, 1782, 1783), and salon of the académie in paris (1783, 1785, 1787, 1789, 1791, 1798, 1802, 1817, 1824).
the first retrospective exhibition of vigée le brun's work was held in 1982 at the kimbell art museum in fort worth, texas. the first major international retrospective exhibition of her art premiered at the galeries nationales du grand palais in paris (2015—2016) and was subsequently shown at the metropolitan museum of art in new york city (2016) and the national gallery of canada in ottawa (2016).
in the episode "the portrait" from the bbc series "let them eat cake" (1999), written by peter learmouth and starring dawn french and jennifer saunders, madame vigée le brun (maggie steed) paints a portrait of the comtesse de vache (jennifer saunders) weeping over a dead canary.
vigée le brun is one of only three characters in joel gross's "marie antoinette: the color of flesh" (premiered in 2007), a fictionalized historical drama about a love triangle set against the backdrop of the french revolution.

the epistle to the galatians, often shortened to galatians, is the ninth book of the new testament. it is a letter from paul the apostle to a number of early christian communities in galatia. scholars have suggested that this is either the roman province of galatia in southern anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of celtic people in central anatolia.
paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding gentile christians and the mosaic law during the apostolic age. paul argues that the gentile galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the mosaic law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of christ. the epistle to the galatians has exerted enormous influence on the history of christianity, the development of christian theology, and the study of the apostle paul.
no original of the letter is known to survive. papyrus 46, the earliest reasonably complete version available to scholars today, dates to approximately 200 ad, approximately 150 years after the original was presumably drafted. this papyrus is fragmented in a few areas, causing some of the original text to be missing, "however, through careful research relating to paper construction, handwriting development, and the established principles of textual criticism, scholars can be rather certain about where these errors and changes appeared and what the original text probably said."
a majority of scholars agree that galatians was written between the late 40s and early 50s, although some date the original composition to c. 50–60 ad.
in the past, a small number of scholars have questioned paul's authorship of galatians, such as bruno bauer, abraham loman, c. h. weisse and frank r. mcguire.. nowadays, biblical scholars agree that galatians is a true example of paul's writing. the main arguments in favor of the authenticity of galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the pauline corpus. george s. duncan described the authenticity of paul as its author as "unquestioned... in every line it betrays its origin as a genuine letter of paul." moreover, paul's possible description of the council of jerusalem () gives a different point of view from the description in , if it is, in fact, describing the jerusalem council.
the central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how gentiles could convert to christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of christians were jewish or jewish proselytes, which historians refer to as the jewish christians. another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the christian community at large. this puts it during the lifetime of paul himself.
paul's letter is addressed "to the churches of galatia" (), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. a minority of scholars have argued that the "galatia" is an ethnic reference to a celtic people living in northern asia minor, but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the roman province in central asia minor, which had been settled by immigrant celts in the 270s bc and retained gaulish features of culture and language in paul's day. acts of the apostles records paul traveling to the "region of galatia and phrygia", which lies immediately west of galatia.
some claim the new testament says that the churches of galatia (antioch of pisidia, iconium, lystra and derbe) were founded by paul himself (; ). they seem to have been composed mainly of gentile converts (). after paul's departure, the churches were led astray from paul's trust/faith-centered teachings by individuals proposing "another gospel" (which centered on salvation through the mosaic law, so-called legalism), whom paul saw as preaching a "different gospel" from what paul had taught (). the galatians appear to have been receptive to the teaching of these newcomers, and the epistle is paul's response to what he sees as their willingness to turn from his teaching.
the identity of these "opponents" is disputed. however, the majority of modern scholars view them as jewish christians, who taught that in order for converts to belong to the people of god, they must be subject to some or all of the jewish law, (i.e. judaizers). the letter indicates controversy concerning circumcision, sabbath observance, and the mosaic covenant. it would appear, from paul's response, that they cited the example of abraham, who was circumcised as a mark of receiving the covenant blessings (). they certainly appear to have questioned paul's authority as an apostle, perhaps appealing to the greater authority of the jerusalem church governed by james (brother of jesus).
the north galatian view holds that the epistle was written very soon after paul's second visit to galatia (). in this view, the visit to jerusalem, mentioned in , is identical with that of acts 15, which is spoken of as a thing of the past. consequently, the epistle seems to have been written after the council of jerusalem. the similarity between this epistle and the epistle to the romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at roughly the same time, during paul's stay in macedonia in roughly 56–57.
this third date takes the word "quickly" in gal. 1:6 literally. john p. meier suggests that galatians was "written in the middle or late 50s, only a few years after the antiochene incident he narrates". eminent biblical scholar helmut koester also subscribes to the "north galatian hypothesis". koester points out that the cities of galatia in the north consist of ankyra, pessinus, and gordium (of the gordian knot fame of alexander the great).
the south galatian view holds that paul wrote galatians before or shortly after the first jerusalem council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since tarsus is in cilicia) after his first visit to jerusalem as a christian, or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern galatia. if it was written to the believers in south galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.
a third theory is that galatians 2:1–10 describes paul and barnabas' visit to jerusalem described in acts 11:30 and 12:25. this theory holds that the epistle was written before the council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of paul's epistles. according to this theory, the revelation mentioned (gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of agabus (acts 11:27–28). this view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the gentiles precludes the acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with acts 11. it further holds that continuing to remember the poor (gal. 2:10) fits with the purpose of the acts 11 visit, but not acts 15.
in addition, the exclusion of any mention of the letter of acts 15 is seen to indicate that such a letter did not yet exist, since paul would have been likely to use it against the legalism confronted in galatians. finally, this view doubts paul's confrontation of peter (gal. 2:11) would have been necessary after the events described in acts 15. if this view is correct, the epistle should be dated somewhere around 47, depending on other difficult to date events, such as paul's conversion.
kirsopp lake found this view less likely and wondered why it would be necessary for the jerusalem council (acts 15) to take place at all if the issue were settled in acts 11:30/12:25, as this view holds. defenders of the view do not think it unlikely an issue of such magnitude would need to be discussed more than once. renowned new testament scholar j.b. lightfoot also objected to this view since it "clearly implies that his [paul's] apostolic office and labours were well known and recognized before this conference."
defenders of this view, such as ronald fung, disagree with both parts of lightfoot's statement, insisting a) paul received his "apostolic office" at his conversion (gal. 1:15–17; acts 9). fung holds, then, that paul's apostolic mission began almost immediately in damascus (acts 9:20). while accepting that paul's apostolic anointing was likely only recognized by the apostles in jerusalem during the events described in galatians 2/acts 11:30, fung does not see this as a problem for this theory.
the citation here is based on the content of the gospel. alternative outlines have been introduced based on the rhetorical form of the letter.
galatians
this epistle addresses the question of whether the gentiles in galatia were obligated to follow mosaic law to be part of the christ community. after an introductory address (), the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle.
in the first two chapters, paul discusses his life before christ and his early ministry, including interactions with other apostles in jerusalem. this is the most extended discussion of paul's past that we find in the pauline letters (cf. philippians 3:1–7). some have read this autobiographical narrative as paul's defense of his apostolic authority (; ). others, however, see paul's telling of the narrative as making an argument to the galatians about the nature of the gospel and the galatians' own situation.
chapter 3 exhorts the galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in jesus. paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of abraham and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of abraham, christ, has come. chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by teaching about the right use of their christian freedom.
in the conclusion of the epistle, paul wrote, "see with what large letters i am writing to you with my own hand." (galatians 6:11, esv) regarding this conclusion, lightfoot, in his commentary on the epistle, says:
"at this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. from the time when letters began to be forged in his name (; ) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries... in the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. he writes it, too, in large, bold characters (gr. "pelikois grammasin"), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."
alternatively, some commentators have postulated that paul's thorn in the flesh was poor eyesight, which caused him to write in characteristically large letters.
galatians also contains a catalogue of vices and virtues, a popular formulation of ancient christian ethics.
probably the most famous single statement made in the epistle, by paul, is in chapter 3, verse 28: "there is neither jew nor gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in christ jesus." the debate surrounding that verse is legend and the two schools of thought are (1) this only applies to the spiritual standing of people in the eyes of god, it does not implicate social distinctions and gender roles on earth; and (2) this is not just about our spiritual standing but is also very much about how we relate to each other and treat each other in the here and now.
position (1) emphasises the immediate context of the verse and notes that it is embedded in a discussion about justification: our relationship with god. position (2) reminds its critics that the "whole letter context" is very much about how people got on in the here and now together, and in fact the discussion about justification came out of an actual example of people treating other people differently (2:11ff).
as canadian religious historian barrie wilson points out in "how jesus became christian", paul's letter to the galatians represents a sweeping rejection of jewish law (torah). in so doing paul clearly takes his christ movement out of the orbit of judaism and into an entirely different milieu. paul's stance constitutes a major contrast to the position of james, brother of jesus, whose group in jerusalem adhered to the observance of torah. many scholars question whether paul's view dovetails with jesus' own teachings concerning the law.

the epistle to the philippians, commonly referred to as philippians, is a pauline epistle of the new testament of the christian bible. the epistle is attributed to paul the apostle and a co-author named timothy, and is addressed to the christian church in philippi. paul and silas first visited philippi in greece during paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 ad. philippi was the location of the first christian community established in greece.
while there is a general consensus that philippians consists of authentically pauline material, the majority of scholars believe that the epistle is a composite of multiple letter fragments from paul to the church in philippi. these letters could have been written from ephesus in 52–55 ad or caesarea maritima in 57–59, but the most likely city of provenance is rome, around 62 ad, or about 10 years after paul's first visit to philippi.
starting in the 1960s, a general consensus emerged among biblical scholars that philippians was not written as one unified letter, but is rather a compilation of fragments from three separate letters from paul to the church in philippi. according to philip sellew, philippians contains the following letter fragments:
in support of the idea that philippians is a composite work, scholars point to the abrupt shifts in tone and topic within the text. there also seem to be chronological inconsistencies from one chapter to the next concerning paul's associate epaphroditus:
these letter fragments likely would have been edited into a single document by the first collector of the pauline corpus, although there is no clear consensus among scholars regarding who this initial collector may have been, or when the first collection of pauline epistles may have been published.
today, a majority of scholars believe that philippians is a composite of multiple letter fragments. according to the theologian g. walter hansen, "the traditional view that philippians was composed as one letter in the form presented in the nt "[new testament]" can no longer claim widespread support." nevertheless, a number of scholars continue to argue for the unity of philippians.
regardless of the literary unity of the letter, scholars agree that the material that was compiled into the epistle to the philippians was originally composed in greek, some time during the 50s or early 60s ad.
it is uncertain where paul was when he wrote the letter(s) that make up philippians. internal evidence in the letter itself points clearly to it being composed while paul was in custody, but it is unclear "which" period of imprisonment the letter refers to. if the testimony of the acts of the apostles is to be trusted, candidates would include the roman imprisonment at the end of acts, and the earlier caesarean imprisonment (acts 23–26). any identification of the place of writing of philippians is complicated by the fact that scholars generally view acts as being an unreliable source of information about the early church.
jim reiher has suggested that the letters could stem from the second period of roman imprisonment attested by early church fathers. the main reasons suggested for a later date, include:
in chapters 1 and 2 of philippians (letter b), paul sends word to the philippians of his upcoming sentence in rome and of his optimism in the face of death, along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the lord despite one's circumstances. paul assures the philippians that his imprisonment is actually helping to spread the christian message, rather than hindering it. he also expresses gratitude for the devotion and heroism of epaphroditus, who the philippian church had sent to visit paul and bring him gifts. some time during his visit with paul, epaphroditus apparently contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness. but he recovers before being sent back to the philippians.
in chapter 3 (letter c), paul warns the philippians about those christians who insist that circumcision is necessary for salvation. he testifies that while he once was a devout pharisee and follower of the jewish law, he now considers these things to be worthless and worldly compared to the gospel of jesus.
in chapter 4, paul urges the philippians to resolve conflicts within their fellowship. in the latter part of the chapter (letter a), paul expresses his gratitude for the gifts that the philippians had sent him, and assures them that god will reward them for their generosity.
throughout the epistle there is a sense of optimism. paul is hopeful that he will be released, and on this basis he promises to send timothy to the philippians for ministry, and expects to also pay them a personal visit.
philippians has been the subject of much research and ralph p. martin argues that philippians 2 may be considered the beginning of the field of christology, specifically referring to the rich analysis that apostle paul began in . veronica koperski views as the beginning of the analysis of the knowledge of christ.
while paul's opening prayer is for love (1:9), based on knowledge of christ, his final prayer is for the peace of god (4:7), which surpasses all understanding. thus the concepts of love, knowledge and peace are jointly developed in the epistle.

the epistle of paul to the colossians, often referred to simply as colossians, is the twelfth book of the new testament. it was written, according to the text, by paul the apostle and timothy to the church in colossae, a small phrygian city near laodicea and approximately from ephesus in asia minor.
scholars have increasingly questioned paul's authorship and attributed the letter to an early follower instead. the authenticity of the letter, however, has been defended with equal strength. if paul was the author, he probably used an amanuensis, or secretary, in writing the letter (col 4:18), possibly timothy.
during the first generation after jesus, paul's epistles to various churches helped establish early christian theology. according to bruce metzger, it was written in the 50s while paul was in prison. colossians is similar to ephesians, also written at this time. some critical scholars have ascribed the epistle to an early follower of paul, writing as paul. the epistle's description of christ as pre-eminent over creation marks it, for some scholars, as representing an advanced christology not present during paul's lifetime. defenders of pauline authorship cite the work's similarities to the letter to philemon, which is broadly accepted as authentic.
the letter may have been written by paul at rome during his first imprisonment. other scholars have suggested that it was written from caesarea or ephesus. if the letter is not considered to be an authentic part of the pauline corpus, then it might be dated during the late 1st century, possibly as late as ad 90.
the letter's authors claim to be paul and timothy, but authorship began to be authoritatively questioned during the 19th century. pauline authorship was held to by many of the early church's prominent theologians, such as irenaeus, clement of alexandria, tertullian, origen of alexandria and eusebius.
however, as with several epistles attributed to paul, critical scholarship disputes this claim. one ground is that the epistle's language doesn't seem to match paul's, with 48 words appearing in colossians that are found nowhere else in his writings and 33 of which occur nowhere else in the new testament. a second ground is that the epistle features a strong use of liturgical-hymnic style which appears nowhere else in paul's work to the same extent. a third is that the epistle's themes related to christ, eschatology and the church seem to have no parallel in paul's undisputed works.
advocates of pauline authorship defend the differences that there are between elements in this letter and those commonly considered the genuine work of paul (e.g. 1 thessalonians). it is argued that these differences can come by human variability, such as by growth in theological knowledge over time, different occasion for writing, as well as use of different secretaries (or amanuenses) in composition. as it is usually pointed out by the same authors who note the differences in language and style, the number of words foreign to the new testament and paul is no greater in colossians than in the undisputed pauline letters (galatians, of similar length, has 35 hapax legomena). in regard to the style, as norman perrin, who argues for pseudonymity, notes, "the letter does employ a great deal of traditional material and it can be argued that this accounts for the non-pauline language and style. if this is the case, the non-pauline language and style are not indications of pseudonymity." not only that, but it has been noted that colossians has indisputably pauline stylistic characteristics, found nowhere else in the new testament. advocates of pauline authorship also argue that the differences between colossians and the rest of the new testament are not as great as they are purported to be.
colossae is in the same region as the seven churches of the book of revelation. in colossians there is mention of local brethren in colossae, laodicea, and hierapolis. colossae was approximately from laodicea and from hierapolis. members of the congregation at colossae may have been incorporating pagan elements into their practice, including worship of elemental spirits. the epistle to the colossians declares christ's supremacy over the entire created universe and exhorts christians to lead godly lives. the letter consists of two parts: first a doctrinal section, then a second regarding conduct. those who believe that the impetus of the letter was a growing heresy in the church see both sections of the letter as opposing false teachers who have been spreading error in the congregation. others see both sections of the letter as primarily encouragement and edification for a developing church.
i. introduction (1:1–14)
ii. the supremacy of christ (1:15–23)
iii. paul's labor for the church (1:24–2:7)
iv. freedom from human regulations through life with christ (2:8–23)
v. rules for holy living (3:1–4:6)
vi. final greetings (4:7–18)
in its doctrinal sections, colossians emphatically explains that christ is begotten before all creation (not created) and is supreme over all that has been created. all things were created through him and for him, and the universe is sustained by him. god had chosen for his complete being to dwell in christ. the "cosmic powers" revered by the false teachers had been "discarded" and "led captive" at christ's death. christ is the master of all angelic forces and the head of the church. christ is the only mediator between god and humanity, the unique agent of cosmic reconciliation. it is the father in colossians who is said to have delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son, not the typical way of articulating salvation today. the son is the agent of reconciliation and salvation not merely of the church, but in some sense redeems the rest of creation as well ("all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven").
the doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. its main theme is developed in colossians chapter 2, with a warning against being drawn away from him in whom dwelt all the fullness of the deity, and who was the head of all spiritual powers. christ was the head of the body of which they were members; and if they were truly united to him, what more did they need?
colossians praises the spiritual growth of the recipients because of their love for all the set-apart ones in christ. it calls them to grow in wisdom and knowledge that their love might be principled love and not sentimentality. "christ in you is your hope of glory!".
"christ in you, the hope of glory"
one of the great themes of the doctrinal section of colossians is promise of union with christ through the indwelling life of god the holy spirit. for example, colossians 1:27, "to them god has chosen to make known among the gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is christ in you, the hope of glory." the apostle paul wrote to remind them of this promise and guard them against moving their on going trust from christ to other philosophies and traditions which did not depend on christ.
as does 1 corinthians 13, colossians 1, in early verses, deals with faith, hope and love. while in the case of 1 corinthians, the love "does not" statements, such as boasting, recall the criticisms of the corinthians earlier in the book. colossians is different. paul looks at the faith, hope and love of the colossian believers as evidence and validation of their faith experience. in introductory verses, 1:6–7, paul states that the fruit seen in them started the day they understood the grace of god in truth. conduct is a fruit of faith.
colossians denounces ascetic practices or avoiding certain foods because christ's death put an end to such distinctions. believers are one in christ, not divided between circumcised and uncircumcised, slave and free, and so on. he then calls on his audience to fulfill all domestic and social obligations. a striking image of religion by such rules used by paul is his use of the word "shadows". some practices in the past may be shadows of what is to come, but christ is the one who cast the shadow.
colossians does not state with precision what heresies were being faced by the church. there are approximately 44 different theories what the heresies encountered by the church at colossae were, including a view there was no particular heresy at all but issues typical of those faced by believers. some argue that it is not merely fasting or feasting or particular area of emotions, conduct or intellect that are denounced but doing them with an independent spirit, not connected to christ, the head of the body or lack of appreciation of the gospel of grace.
the practical part of the epistle, enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. they are exhorted to mind things that are above colossians 3:1–4, to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man. many special duties of the christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the christian character. the letter ends with customary prayer, instruction, and greetings.
colossians is often categorized as one of the "prison epistles" that include ephesians, colossians, philippians, and philemon. colossians has some close parallels with the letter to philemon: names of some of the same people (e.g., timothy, aristarchus, archippus, mark, epaphras, luke, onesimus, and demas) appear in both epistles, and both were written by paul.

the first epistle to the thessalonians, commonly referred to as first thessalonians or 1 thessalonians, is a pauline epistle of the new testament of the christian bible. the epistle is attributed to paul the apostle, and is addressed to the church in thessalonica, in modern-day greece. it was likely the first of paul's letters, probably written by the end of ad 52.
most new testament scholars believe paul the apostle wrote this letter from corinth, although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e.g., codices alexandrinus, mosquensis, and angelicus) state that paul wrote it in athens after timothy had returned from macedonia with news of the state of the church in thessalonica (; ). for the most part, the letter is personal in nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of doctrine, almost as an aside. paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage and reassure the christians there. paul urges them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the return of christ.
unlike all subsequent pauline epistles, 1 thessalonians does not focus on justification by faith or questions of jewish–gentile relations, themes that are covered in all other letters. many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the epistle to the galatians, where paul's positions on these matters were formed and elucidated.
the majority of new testament scholars hold 1 thessalonians to be authentic, although a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its authenticity, most notably clement schrader and f.c. baur. 1 thessalonians matches other accepted pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its authorship is also affirmed by 2 thessalonians.
it is also sometimes suggested that 1 thes. 5:1–11 is a post-pauline insertion that has many features of lukan language and theology that serves as an apologetic correction to paul's imminent expectation of the second coming in 1 thes. 4:13–18.
other scholars, such as schmithals, eckhart, demke and munro, have developed complicated theories involving redaction and interpolation in 1 and 2 thessalonians.
paul claimed the title of the "apostle to the gentiles", and established gentile churches in several important cities in the roman empire.
according to bart d. ehrman, the acts of the apostles tells a different story of paul's career, but in this case it reports that, while there were "some" jews converted during paul's initial preaching in thessalonica, the gentiles who were converted were "a large number" and the jews as a body fiercely opposed paul's work there.
paul, speaking for himself, silas, and timothy, gives thanks for the news about their faith and love; he reminds them of the kind of life he had lived while he was with them. paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself, reminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. he did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an apostle to impose upon them.
paul goes on to explain that the dead will be resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the lord in the air.

the epistle of paul to titus, usually referred to simply as titus, is one of the three pastoral epistles (along with 1 timothy and 2 timothy) in the new testament, historically attributed to paul the apostle. it is addressed to saint titus and describes the requirements and duties of elders and bishops.
not mentioned in the acts of the apostles, saint titus was noted in galatians (cf. gal. 2:1, 3) where paul wrote of journeying to jerusalem with barnabas, accompanied by titus. he was then dispatched to corinth, greece, where he successfully reconciled the christian community there with paul, its founder. titus was later left on the island of crete to help organize the church, and later met back with the apostle paul in nicopolis. he soon went to dalmatia (now croatia). according to eusebius of caesarea in the "ecclesiastical history", he served as the first bishop of crete and remained there in his old years. he was buried in cortyna (gortyna), crete; his head was later removed to venice during the invasion of crete by the saracens in 832 and was enshrined in st mark's basilica, venice, italy.
scholars are not unanimous about the authenticity of the pastoral epistles, but it is considered pseudepigraphic by about 80% of scholars. titus is usually one of the three pastoral epistles attributed to paul. titus has a very close affinity with 1 timothy, sharing similar phrases and expressions and similar subject matter.
the author of "titus" identifies himself as "paul, a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ." according to "easton's bible dictionary" (1893), the epistle was probably written about the same time as the first epistle to timothy, with which it has many affinities."
scholars who believe paul wrote "titus" date its composition from the circumstance that it was written after paul's visit to crete (titus 1:5). that visit could not be the one referred to in the acts of the apostles 27:7, when paul was on his voyage to rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. thus traditional exegesis supposes that after his release paul sailed from rome into asia, passing crete by the way, and that there he left titus "to set in order the things that were wanting." thence he would have gone to ephesus, where he left timothy, and from ephesus to macedonia, where he wrote the "first epistle to timothy", and thence, according to the subscription of this epistle, to "nicopolis of macedonia", from which place he wrote to titus, about 66 or 67.
recent scholarship has revived the theory that paul used an amanuensis, or secretaries, in writing his letters (e.g. rom 16:22), but possibly luke for the pastorals this was a common practice in ancient letter writing, even for the biblical writers.
the pastoral epistles are regarded by a majority of scholars as being pseudepigraphical. on the basis of the language and content of the pastoral epistles, these scholars today doubt that they were written by paul and believe that they were written after his death. critics claim the vocabulary and style of the pauline letters could not have been written by paul according to available biographical information and reflect the views of the emerging church rather than the apostle's. these scholars date the epistle from the 80s ad up to the end of the 2nd century. the church of england's common worship lectionary scripture commentary concurs with this view: "the proportioning of the theological and practical themes is one factor that leads us to think of these writings as coming from the post-pauline church world of the late first or early second century".
one of the secular peculiarities of the epistle to titus is the reference to the epimenides paradox: "one of the cretans, a prophet of their own, said, 'cretans are always liars'." the statement by a member of a group that all members are liars is a famous logic problem, applicable also to .
in "titus 1:9" paul describes some among the jewish christians as false teachers. paul describes the false teachers as rebellious, empty talkers who claim to teach the law "without understanding" and deceivers who deliberately lead the faithful astray. calvin wrote that vain talking (greek: mataiologia) is contrasted here with useful doctrine, including any trivial and frivolous doctrines that contribute nothing to piety and fear of god.

the eurovision song contest (), often simply called eurovision, is an annual international song competition, with participants representing primarily european countries. each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio, then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the winner. at least 50 countries are eligible to compete , and since 2015, australia has been allowed as a guest entrant.
based on the sanremo music festival held in italy since 1951, eurovision has been broadcasting every year since its inauguration in 1956, making it the longest-running annual international television contest and one of the world's longest-running television programmes. it is also one of the most watched non-sporting events, with audience figures of between 100 million and 600 million internationally. it has been broadcast in several countries that do not compete, such as the united states, canada, new zealand, and china. since 2000, it has been broadcast online via the eurovision website.
ireland holds the record for most victories, with seven wins, including four times in five years in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996. under the current voting system, in place since 2016, the highest-scoring winner is salvador sobral of portugal who won the 2017 contest in kyiv, ukraine, with 758 points; under the previous system, the highest-scoring winner was alexander rybak of norway with 387 points in 2009. the most recent winner is duncan laurence from the netherlands who won the 2019 event with the song "arcade". winning the eurovision song contest provides artists with a local career boost and sometimes long-lasting international success. some of them include abba (winners for sweden), bucks fizz & lulu (winners for the uk), celine dion (winner for switzerland), johnny logan (who won the contest twice for ireland), dana international (for israel) and lena (who won for germany).
as a war-torn europe was rebuilding itself in the 1950s, the european broadcasting union (ebu)—based in switzerland—set up an ad hoc committee to search for ways of bringing together the countries of the ebu around a "light entertainment programme". at a committee meeting held in monaco in january 1955 with marcel bezençon of the swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by sergio pugliese of the italian television rai) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union. the competition was based upon the existing sanremo music festival held in italy and was seen as a technological experiment in live television. in those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network. satellite television did not exist and the eurovision network comprised a terrestrial microwave network. the concept, then known as "eurovision grand prix", was approved by the ebu general assembly in a meeting held in rome on 19 october 1955, and it was decided that the first contest would take place in spring 1956 in lugano, switzerland. the name "eurovision" was first used in relation to the ebu's network by british journalist george campey in the london "evening standard" in 1951.
the first contest was held in the town of lugano, switzerland, on 24 may 1956. seven countries participated—each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. this was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957, all contests have allowed one entry per country. the 1956 contest was won by the host nation, switzerland.
the contest was first known as the "eurovision grand prix" (in english). this "grand prix" name was adopted by germany, denmark, norway and the francophone countries, with the french designation being "". the "grand prix" was dropped in 1973 and replaced with" " (contest) in french and in 2001 with the english name in german, but not in danish or norwegian. the eurovision network is used to carry many news and sports programmes internationally, among other specialised events organised by the ebu. however, in the minds of the public, the name "eurovision" is most closely associated with the song contest.
the format of the contest has changed over the years, though the basic tenets have always been thus: participant countries submit original songs, performed live on a television programme broadcast across the eurovision network by the ebu simultaneously to all countries. a "country" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but not always, that country's national public broadcasting organisation. the programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the programme is broadcast from the auditorium in the host city. during this programme, after all the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own song. at the end of the programme, the song with the most points is declared as the winner. the winner receives, simply, the prestige of having won—although it is usual for a trophy to be awarded to the winning songwriters, and the winning country is formally invited to host the event the following year.
the programme is invariably opened by one or more presenters, welcoming viewers to the show. between the songs and the announcement of the voting, an interval act is performed.
as national broadcasters join and leave the eurovision feed transmitted by the ebu, the ebu/eurovision network logo ident (not to be confused with the song contest logo) is displayed. the accompanying theme music (used on other eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to marc-antoine charpentier's "te deum". originally, the same logo was used for both the eurovision network and the european broadcasting union, however, they now have two different logos; when the ident is transmitted, it is the eurovision network logo that appears.
since 1995 the final of the contest has taken place on a saturday evening in may, at 19:00 utc (15:00 edt, 20:00 bst/ist, or 21:00 cest). in the early years, the competition was held variously on sunday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday evenings; since 1963, every contest final has taken place on a saturday. the earliest show in the calendar year took place in 1957 (3 march) and the latest in 1999 and 2010 (29 may).
eligible participants include primarily active members (as opposed to associate members) of the ebu. active members are those who are located in states that fall within the european broadcasting area, or are member states of the council of europe.
the european broadcasting area is defined by the international telecommunication union:
the western boundary of region 1 is defined by a line running from the north pole along meridian 10° west of greenwich to its intersection with parallel 72° north; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 50° west and parallel 40° north; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 20° west and parallel 10° south; thence along meridian 20° west to the south pole.
active members include media organisations, whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions.
if an ebu active member wishes to participate they must fulfil conditions as laid down by the rules of the contest. a separate copy is drafted annually. , this included the necessity to have broadcast the previous year's programme within their country. after russia's withdrawal from the 2017 event in ukraine, and channel 1 russia's refusal to air the event, there is some confusion as to whether this rule still exists. c1r did enter a song in 2018, which was voted out of the competition at the semi-final.
a common misconception is that eurovision participants have to be from europe. however, that's not true, any full ebu member is eligible for participation. furthermore, associate members are eligible for participation since eurovision 2017, as long as the eurovision reference group approves it (on a case by case basis). , australia is the only associate member to have participated.
the broadcaster must have paid the ebu a participation fee in advance of the deadline specified in the rules of the contest for the year in which they wish to participate.
eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of europe, despite the "euro" in "eurovision" – nor does it have any relation to the european union. several countries geographically outside the boundaries of europe have competed: israel, cyprus and armenia in western asia (cyprus is a member of the council of europe and a member state of the european union), since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; australia since 2015 and morocco, in north africa, in the 1980 competition alone. in addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in europe have competed: turkey, since 1975; russia, since 1994; georgia, since 2007; and azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition.
fifty-two countries have participated at least once. these are listed here alongside the year in which they made their début:
most of the expense of the contest is covered by commercial sponsors and contributions from the other participating nations. the contest is considered to be a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. in the summer of 2005, ukraine abolished its normal visa requirement for visitors from the eu to coincide with its hosting of the event.
preparations for the event start a matter of weeks after the host wins in the previous year, and confirms to the ebu that they intend to—and have the capacity to—host the event. a host city is chosen—often a national or regional capital city—and a suitable concert venue is identified. the two largest concert venues were parken in copenhagen (which held approximately 38,000 people when denmark hosted in 2001) and the esprit arena in düsseldorf (which held approximately 36,500 people when germany hosted in 2011). the smallest town to have been hosts was millstreet in county cork, ireland, in 1993. the village had a population of 1,500—although the green glens arena venue could hold up to 8,000 people.
the hotel and press facilities in the vicinity are always a consideration when choosing a host city and venue. in kiev 2005, hotel rooms were scarce as the contest organisers asked the ukrainian government to put a block on bookings they did not control themselves through official delegation allocations or tour packages: this led to many people's hotel bookings being cancelled.
after the first two contests were hosted by switzerland and germany, it was decided that henceforth the winning country would host the contest the next year. the winner of the 1957 contest was the netherlands, and dutch television accepted the responsibility of hosting in 1958. in all but five of the years since this rule has been in place, the winning country has hosted the show the following year. the exceptions are:
with the invitation of australia to participate since 2015, it was announced that due to the logistical and financial issues that would occur if australia were to host, in the event of an australian victory, the broadcaster sbs will co-host the next contest in a european city in collaboration with an ebu member broadcaster of their choice. however, this has yet to happen and since 1981, all contests have been held in the country which won the previous year.
the former generic logo was introduced for the 2004 eurovision song contest in turkey, to create a consistent visual identity. the host country's flag appears in the heart of the generic logo. each year of the contest, the host country creates a sub-theme which is usually accompanied and expressed with a sub-logo and slogan. the theme and slogan are announced by the ebu and the host country's national broadcaster.
the generic logo was revamped in 2014, ten years after the first generic logo was created. the revamped logo was conducted by lead designer cornelis jacobs and his team of cityzen agency. the logo was used for the first time in the 2015 eurovision song contest, the 60th anniversary of the contest.
since the 2002 contest, slogans have been introduced in the show (2009 being the only exception). the slogan is decided by the host broadcaster and is then used to develop a visual design for the contest.
the term "eurovision week" is used to refer to the week during which the contest takes place. as it is a live show, the eurovision song contest requires the performers to have perfected their acts in rehearsals for the programme to run smoothly. in addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the eurovision auditorium. these rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television. a number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.
each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, whose job it is to co-ordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that country's representative to the ebu in the host city. members of the delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers and—in the years where songs were performed with a live orchestra—a conductor. also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their tv and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. the commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.
since 2004, the first rehearsals have commenced on the sunday almost two weeks before the grand final. there are two rehearsal periods for each country. the countries taking part in the semi-finals have their first rehearsal over four days from the first sunday to wednesday. the second is from thursday to sunday. the countries which have already directly qualified for the grand final rehearse on the saturday and sunday.
after each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's artistic director in the video viewing room. here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. at this point the head of delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions. the rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. a printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes.
before each of the semi-finals three dress rehearsals are held. two rehearsals are held the day before (one in the afternoon and the other in the evening), while the third is held on the afternoon of the live event. since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold so the public may attend these dress rehearsals.
the same applies for the final, with two rehearsals on the friday and the third on saturday afternoon before the live transmission of the grand final on saturday evening. for both semi-finals and for the final, the second dress rehearsal is also the "jury final", this is where the jury from each country casts their votes. this means that 50% of the result is already decided before the live contests have taken place.
on the monday evening of eurovision week, a "mayor's reception" is traditionally held, where the city administration hosts a celebration that eurovision has come to their city. this is usually held in a grand municipally owned location in the city centre. all delegations are invited, and the party is usually accompanied by live music, complimentary food and drink and—in recent years—fireworks.
after the semi-final and grand final there are after-show parties, held either in a facility in the venue complex or in another suitable location within the city.
a "euroclub" is held every night of the week: this is a eurovision-themed nightclub, to which all accredited personnel are invited.
during the week many delegations have traditionally hosted their own parties in addition to the officially sponsored ones. however, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the euroclub.
numerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the ebu. the rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. the most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.
all vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks. in 1999, the croatian song performed by doris dragović and composed by tonči huljić featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. the croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. the ebu nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.
from 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. from 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted—although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. if a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. in 1997 this requirement was dropped.
in 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution. the host that year, israel's iba, decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).
each submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. in the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. from 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. in 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer ingvar wixell performing sweden's 1965 entry in english. the swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at melodifestivalen 1965, but it was later translated into english for the eurovision contest.
the language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished. several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-english-speaking countries sang in english, including abba in 1974.
in 1977, the ebu decided to revert to the national language restriction. however, special dispensation was given to germany and belgium as their national selections had already taken place before the decision was made; both countries' entries that year were in english.
in 1999, the rule was changed again to allow the choice of language once more, which resulted in 12 out of 23 countries, including the united kingdom, singing in english that year. belgium entered the 2003 contest with "sanomi", a song sung in a constructed language, finishing in second place. in 2006, the dutch entry, "amambanda", was sung partly in english and partly in an artificial language. in 2008, the belgian entry, "o julissi", was sung in an artificial language. in 2011, the norwegian entry, "haba haba", which was sung in english and swahili, was the first song to be sung in an african language, apart from arabic.
since the language rule was abolished in 1999, songs in english have become increasingly common. in 2016, all but three out of 36 semi-finalists had songs in english, with only two (bosnia and herzegovina and north macedonia) performing songs in their native languages, as austria sent a song in french. in the final, all but three out of 26 contestants had songs in english. after salvador sobral's win in 2017 with a portuguese-language song, the 2018 edition saw a significant increase in the use of native languages, with twelve of 43 participants singing in their country's native language (not including estonia, whose representative opted to sing in italian). in 2019, it increased further with entries performed in eighteen different languages.
the voting system used in the contest has changed over the years. the current system has been in place since 2016, and is a positional voting system. each country awards two sets of 12, 10, 8–1 points to their 10 favourite songs: one from their professional jury of votes of five music professionals and the other from televoting.
historically, a country's votes were decided by an internal jury, but in 1997 five countries (austria, switzerland, germany, sweden and the united kingdom) experimented with televoting, giving members of the public in those countries the opportunity to vote "en masse" for their favourite songs. the experiment was a success, and from 1998 onwards all countries were encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. back-up juries are still used by each country, in the event of a televoting failure. nowadays members of the public may also vote by sms, in addition to televoting. in every case, every country cannot vote for its own song from 2013, the public may also vote via a mobile app.
the current method for ranking entries, introduced in 2016, is to sum together the points calculated from the telephone vote and the jury separately. prior to this, the jury and televoting rankings were combined 50/50 before the number of points were calculated. it was first used in the final of the 2009 edition, and extended the following year to the semi-finals.
since 1964 the voting has been presided over by the ebu scrutineer, who is responsible for ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn. since 2011, the executive supervisor was supported by an event supervisor, to oversee and coordinate all event-related matters on behalf of the ebu. sietse bakker served in the role for the first six years, replaced by nadja burkhardt.
the following are the scrutineers and executive supervisors of the eurovision song contest appointed by the ebu:
according to one study of eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the same way.
after the interval act is over, when all the points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce the results of their vote. prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. however, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. for example, the french spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the eiffel tower or an italian presenter might be seen with the colosseum in the background.
from 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. in 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their iso codes). in 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance. between 2006 and 2010, like in 1974, a separate draw was held to determine the order in which countries would present their votes. from 2011 to 2015, the voting order was determined by the results of a jury the day before the final so as to create as much suspense as possible when the votes were revealed.
from 1971 to 1973, each country sent two jurors, who were present at the contest venue (though the juries in 1972 were locked away in the great hall of edinburgh castle) and announced their votes as the camera was trained on them. in 1973 one of the swiss jurors made a great show of presenting his votes with flamboyant gestures. this system was retired the next year.
in 1956 no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that switzerland had won. from 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical scoreboard to the side of the stage. as digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic representation which could be displayed on the tv screen at the will of the programme's director.
in 2006 the ebu decided to save time during the broadcast—much of which had been taken up with the announcement of every single point—because there was an ever-increasing number of countries voting. since then, votes from 1 to 7 from each country have been displayed automatically on screen and the remaining points (8, 10 and 12) are read out in ascending order by the spokesperson, culminating with the maximum 12 points. countries must announce the country names and points in either english or french and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. for this reason, the expression "" when the host or spokesperson states the top score in french is popularly associated with the contest throughout the continent. since 2016, only the name of the top jury votegetter is announced, with the points awarded to the other 9 countries shown in an on-screen scoreboard during the announcement. in addition, only the jury points are announced by country. the televoting results are announced in aggregate, from lowest-scoring country to highest. in the 2019 contest the televoting results were announced in aggregate in inverse standing order based on the jury votes; starting with spain (7 points from the juries) and culminating in sweden (239 points from the juries). after the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.
in , four of the sixteen countries taking part, france, spain, the netherlands and the united kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. there was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. this caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. finland, norway, sweden and portugal did not participate in the 1970 contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. this prompted the ebu to introduce a tie-break rule.
under the current rules, in the event of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of countries who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. if the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. if there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared—and then the numbers of 8-point scores, all the way down the list. in the extremely unlikely event of there then "still" being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner. since 2008, the same tie-break rule now applies to ties for all places.
as of 2019, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in , when france and sweden both totalled 146 points. at that time, the rules did not include counting the numbers of countries awarding any points to these countries' songs, but began with tallying up the numbers of 12-point scores awarded. both france and sweden had received four sets of 12 points. however, because sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. had the current rule been in play, france would have won instead.
each participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish. from 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme. four major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. the dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the enschede fireworks disaster. spain's rtve delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 contest, due to the madrid open tennis tournament. the albanian state broadcaster deferred their broadcast of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the qafa e vishës bus accident.
in 2018, chinese broadcaster mango tv edited the albanian and irish songs out of their broadcast of the first semi-final for violations of chinese broadcast regulations. the albanian performer had visible tattoos, and the irish song featured a storyline showing vignettes of a homosexual couple. eurovision terminated mango's broadcasting rights when the broadcaster refused to agree to air the second semi-final and the grand final unedited.
the first edition ever of the eurovision song contest in 1956 was broadcast live, but not recorded, so only a sound recording of the radio transmission has survived from the original broadcast. the ninth edition in 1964 hosted by danmarks radio was recorded on tape, but a fire destroyed the recording, and it is unknown if any other tv station in europe has another copy. only small portions of the original broadcast and audio from the radio transmission have survived.
in late 2011, the ebu had begun archiving all the contests since the first edition in 1956 to be finalised before the 2015 contest, for the 60th anniversary. it was later reported that the archive is ready and will be released on the 60th anniversary with making the content available to journalists in broadcast-ready formats while also giving public accessibility to "selected content" through the official eurovision website.
in 1978, hosted in paris only a month after the 1978 south lebanon conflict, during the performance of the israeli entry, the jordanian broadcaster jrtv suspended the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers. when it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that israel's song "a-ba-ni-bi" was going to win the contest, jrtv abruptly ended the transmission. afterwards, the jordanian news media refused to acknowledge that israel had won and announced that the winner was belgium (who had actually come in 2nd place). in 1981 jrtv did not broadcast the voting because the name of israel appeared on the scoreboard.
in 2005, lebanon intended to participate in the contest. however, lebanese law does not allow recognition of israel, and consequently lebanese broadcaster télé liban did not intend to transmit the israeli entry. the ebu informed them that such an act would breach the rules of the contest, and lebanon was subsequently forced to withdraw from the competition. their late withdrawal incurred a fine, since they had already confirmed their participation and the deadline had passed. however, the eurovision song contest albums were still being sold in lebanese music stores until 2009, with the word israel erased from the back cover. , the albums were banned completely from sale.
in 2009, the song "we don't wanna put in" was selected to represent georgia. however, the song text was banned by eurovision as it was interpreted as criticism against prime minister of russia vladimir putin after the russo-georgian war the previous year. when asked to change the lyrics of the song, the georgian broadcaster gpb withdrew from the 2009 contest.
the number of countries participating has steadily grown over time, from seven in 1956 to over 20 in the late 1980s. in 1993, twenty-five countries participated in the competition, including, for the first time, bosnia-herzegovina, croatia and slovenia, entering independently due to the dissolution of yugoslavia. in the most recent edition in 2019, a total of 41 countries took part, with 26 appearing in the final.
because the contest is a live television programme, a reasonable time limit must be imposed on the duration of the show. in recent years the nominal limit has been three hours, with the broadcast occasionally over-running.
since 1993, and following the cessation of the eastern european oirt network and the merger with the ebu, there have been more entries than there is time to reasonably include in a single tv show. several relegation or qualification systems have been tried to limit the number of countries participating in the contest at one time. thus the 1993 contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in ljubljana in which seven new countries fought for three places in the international competition. bosnia-herzegovina, croatia, estonia, hungary, romania, slovenia and slovakia took part in "kvalifikacija za millstreet"; and the three former yugoslav republics, bosnia-herzegovina, croatia and slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final. also to be introduced that year was "relegation": the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 contest. the 1994 contest included—for the first time—estonia, romania, slovakia, lithuania, hungary, poland and russia.
relegation continued in 1994 and 1995; but in 1996 a different pre-selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated. audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some weeks before the television show. these juries selected the songs which would be included in the international broadcast. norway, as the host country in 1996 (having won the previous year), automatically qualified and so did not need to go through pre-selection.
one country which failed to qualify in the 1996 pre-selection was germany. as one of the largest financial contributors to the ebu, their non-participation in the contest brought about a funding issue, which the ebu would have to consider.
since 2000, france, germany, spain and united kingdom have automatically qualified for the final, regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests, as they are the four biggest financial contributors to the ebu. these countries became known as the "big four". on 31 december 2010, it was announced that italy would compete in the eurovision song contest after a fourteen-year absence and that it would also automatically qualify for the final, joining the other four qualifiers to become the "big five". germany became the first and, , the only "big five" country to win the contest since the rule was made in 2000, when lena meyer-landrut won the 2010 contest. turkey withdrew from the 2013 contest with the status of the "big five" being one of the reasons cited. they also did not participate in the following 6 years of contests (2014–19) for similar reasons, as well as stating their opposition to the 50/50 jury and televoting system that began being applied in the final of the 2009 contest.
the big four/five countries pay approximately five to six times the participation fee of a "standard" participating country, effectively subsidizing smaller european broadcasters, thus allowing them to be able to afford entry into the competition. without the contribution of the big five it is estimated that the participation cost for a "standard" country would be double what they currently pay.
it is sometimes discussed whether the big 5 measure benefits or prejudicates the countries' performances in the contest. since its creation, countries of the big five have placed last in 8 of the lastest 15 contests (2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). the only big 5 country that has never finished last since the introduction of this concept is italy: since its return in 2011, the country placed in the top 10 seven times out of 9 contests, including four times in the top 5 and twice as the runner up. some measures have been taken by the ebu to give the big 5 contestants a similar status to those competing at the semi-finals, such as broadcasting their acts in the semi-final interval.
from 1997 to 2001, countries qualified for each contest based on the average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years. however, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be excluded merely because of poor previous results, which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt might be. the worst example of this was that bosnia and herzegovina finished 7th with 86 points in the 1999 contest, but it wasn't enough to save the country being relegated from taking part in the 2000 contest. this led the ebu to create what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem. a qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the 2004 contest. this semi-final was held on the wednesday during eurovision week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 utc on the saturday. the highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. from 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the thursday of eurovision week. in these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.
the ten highest-placed non-big four countries in the "grand final" were guaranteed a place in the following year's grand final, without having to qualify. if, for example, germany came in the top ten, the eleventh-placed non-big-four country would automatically qualify for the next year's grand final. the remaining countries—which had not automatically qualified for the grand final—had to enter the semi-final.
at the 50th annual meeting of the ebu reference group in september 2007, it was decided that, with still more nations entering, starting from the 2008 contest onwards "two" semi-finals would be held, from each of which one could qualify for the final. from 2008 onwards, the scoreboard position in previous years has not been relevant, and—save for the automatic qualifiers—all participating countries have had to participate in the semi-finals, regardless of their previous year's scoreboard position. the only countries which automatically qualify for the grand final are the host country and the big five: france, germany, italy, spain and the united kingdom, who continue to enjoy their protected status.
in each of the semi-finals the voting is conducted among those countries which participate in that semi-final. with regard to the automatic grand final qualifiers, who do not participate in the semi-finals, a draw is conducted to determine in which semi-final each of them will be allowed to vote. in contrast, "every" participating country in a particular year may vote in the saturday grand final – whether their song qualified for the final or not.
the ten countries which receive the most votes in each semi-final qualify for the grand final. they are announced by the presenters in english and french, in a random order. full voting results are withheld until after the grand final, whereupon they are published on the ebu's website. to date only two countries have always qualified to the final since the implementation of the semi-finals system in 2004: australia and ukraine.
, holds the record for the highest number of wins, having won the contest seven times. is second with six wins. , , the and the are joint third with five wins each. hold four victories. and have both won thrice, six countries have won twice, while 12 countries have won once. a further 24 countries have participated, but have yet to win.
the united kingdom holds the record for the highest number of runner-up placings, coming in second on no fewer than 15 occasions . germany, russia, france, spain and ireland have four runner-up entries. norway holds the record for finishing in last place in the final the most times: eleven.
israel is the only non-european country to win four times.
the early years of the contest saw many wins for "traditional" eurovision countries: france, the netherlands, and luxembourg. however, the success of these countries has declined in recent decades; france last won in 1977; and luxembourg, in 1983. luxembourg last entered the contest in 1993.
the first years of the 21st century produced numerous first-time winners, from both "new" and long-serving countries who had previously entered numerous times but without victories. every year from 2001 to 2008 inclusive, a country won for its first time. estonia was the first post-soviet country to win the competition in 2001. in 2003, turkey won for the first time. in 2005, won for the first time, 15 years after the last southern european country won, i.e. in 1990; overall the south of europe won the competition only six times (seven if serbia is included). the 2006 winner was 's lordi, earning finland's first win after having entered the contest for 45 years. , on the other hand, did not have to wait so long, winning with only their second entry in 2004. also notably, although not the nation's first win, conchita wurst's win in 2014 broke a 48-year losing run for . the contest was won by in 2008.
when won in 2017, they ended a 49-year run of entering without a win, beating 's previous record of 45 years. now holds this record, with 35 years without a win, achieving their highest score, second, in 2018, and is the most successful country without a win, achieving two-second places and two third places.
in 2009, won the contest with 387 points – alexander rybak held the winning title with his song "fairytale". his outstanding performance meant he had the highest total in the history of the competition, becoming the first competitor to score 300 or more points, including 16 maximum scores. this feat was emulated in 2012, when sweden won with 372 points, but with a new record of 18 maximum scores. in 2015, won the contest with 365 points, becoming the first country to ever reach 300 points or more twice while winning both times. placed second with 303 points, becoming the first country to score more than 300 points without winning.
in 2016, the scoring system was changed, which meant that it was much easier to achieve over 300 points – in fact, the winner – jamala of , achieved 534 points, and all of top 9 scored 200 or more points, and 25 of the 26 positions got their highest points ever. this feat was then extended in 2017 when salvador sobral beat ukraine's points record by 224 points, in addition to beating the same score by 81 points. however, had portugal won under the previous voting system, it would still have had the highest total ever, with 417 points, becoming the first competitor to score 400 or more points, and would have set a new record of 20 maximum scores, beating norway and sweden, respectively.
since the introduction of the 50/50 voting system in 2009, the juries and the voters have disagreed on the winner on five occasions, in 2011, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. 2011 winner azerbaijan won only the televotes (jury votes were won by italy) and 2015 winner sweden won only the jury votes (televotes were won by italy). in 2016, ukraine did not win either the jury vote or the televote, but won the contest with the highest combined vote. the televote was won by russia and the jury vote by australia. in 2018, eventual winner israel won the televote but only came in third with the jury vote (won by austria). in 2019, netherlands placed third with the juries (north macedonia first, sweden second) and second with the televote (norway first). however, the netherlands had the highest combined vote and thus they won the contest.
since 2008, the winner has been awarded an official winner's trophy of the eurovision song contest. the trophy is a handmade piece of sandblasted glass in the shape of a 1950s microphone. the song writers and composers of the winning entry receive smaller versions of the trophy. the original design was created by kjell engman of kosta boda, who specialises in glass art.
there have been a number of eurovision artists and groups whose careers were directly launched into the spotlight following their win. notable examples were abba, who won the contest for sweden in 1974 with their song "waterloo", and went on to become one of the most successful pop bands in history; the french canadian singer céline dion, who won the contest for switzerland in 1988 with the song "ne partez pas sans moi", which subsequently helped launch her international career;
and the winners of the 1981 contest, bucks fizz for the united kingdom with the song "making your mind up", which also launched a successful international career.
other artists who have achieved varying degrees of success after winning the contest include
france gall ("poupée de cire, poupée de son", luxembourg 1965), dana ("all kinds of everything", ireland 1970),
vicky leandros ("après toi", luxembourg 1972),
brotherhood of man ("save your kisses for me", united kingdom 1976), and johnny logan (who won twice for ireland, with "what's another year" in 1980 and "hold me now" in 1987).
several other winners were well-known artists who won the contest mid-career after they had already established themselves, including katrina and the waves, winners in 1997 with "love shine a light", lulu, winner in 1969 with "boom bang-a-bang", and sandie shaw, winner in 1967 with "puppet on a string". women have dominated the contest since its inception, either performing solo or as a member of a group on 50 of the 67 winning entries . the 2017 winner was a solo male performance by salvador sobral. however, his sister and the song's composer luísa sobral joined him for the winner's reprise.
the most recent winner of the contest is duncan laurence who won the 2019 contest for the netherlands.
since , the tradition of interval acts between the songs in the competition programme and the announcement of the voting has been established. among these acts, there are usually the previous winner, performances devoted to the history of the eurovision song contest, as well as representatives of the traditional music scene of the host country. one of the most famous interval performances is the first public appearance of riverdance, a theatrical show consisting mainly of traditional irish music and dance, in . riverdance was later performed as an interval act at both the "" (2005) and "eurovision song contest's greatest hits" (2015) events.
interval and opening entertainment has included such acts as pop superstars madonna (), justin timberlake (), aqua () and t.a.t.u. (), but also famous violinist vanessa-mae () and world music artists mariza () and goran bregović (). the world-renowned cirque du soleil (), alexandrov ensemble (), vienna boys' choir ( and ), fire of anatolia () and "prague theatre of illuminated drawings" () also performed on the eurovision stage. a flashmob-styled performance with madcon performing "glow", alongside live and taped footage of public outdoor dance events from across europe, was the interval act for . other interval acts include recorded footage of the royal edinburgh military tattoo (), circus clown charlie rivel (), quick-change artist arturo brachetti () and mentalist lior suchard ().
the event in jerusalem finished with the three presenters inviting everyone on stage to sing a rendition of the english version of "hallelujah", the israeli winner from the 1979 contest, as a tribute to the victims of the balkan war (particularly fr yugoslavia, which was banned from participation as penalty for the balkan wars). however, due to nato's bombing of the serbian television headquarters, the eurovision was not broadcast in serbia that year.
in recognition of australia's love affair with the annual event, the interval act for the second semi-final in was a presentation by australia featuring jessica mauboy who performed "sea of flags". her appearance marked the first time australia had been represented at eurovision and was first solo artist from a non-participating country to perform as a guest. since 2014 the winners of the most recent junior eurovision song contest also make a guest appearance during one of the three shows, typically at the grand final (however this was moved to the first semi-final for the 2019 contest) and are interviewed at a press conference held for the junior contest.
in the first semi-final of in stockholm, part of the interval acts was a dance performance devoted to the european migrant crisis. "the grey people" was choreographed by fredrik rydman.
special guests of eurovision song contest have been also well-known athletes, such as boxers vitali and wladimir klitschko (), tennis player novak djokovic ( first semi-final) and retired basketball player vlade divac (2008 grand final), who opened the televoting. in , elton john spoke to the presenters live from the life ball in vienna and one astronaut and one cosmonaut—ed lu and yuri malenchenko—gave their greetings from the international space station (iss). russian cosmonaut gennady padalka and japanese astronaut koichi wakata opened the televoting for the grand final in during the expedition 19 flight to the iss. tennis player ana ivanovic (), footballer zlatan ibrahimović () and an actress and model gal gadot () have appeared in the promotional videos about the host city.
since , the tradition of opening the grand finals with the "parade of nations" or the "flag parade" has been established, similar to the olympic games opening ceremony. in 2016, the parade was themed as a tribute to swedish fashion design and dance music with artists being welcomed on stage in a catwalk fashion show with flags being projected onto 26 dresses designed by bea szenfeld.
in 1981, a concert television programme was held to commemorate the contest's twenty-fifth anniversary. the event, entitled songs of europe, took place in mysen, norway, featuring nearly all the winners of the contest, from 1956 to 1981. it was hosted by rolf kirkvaag and titten tei.
in 2005, the ebu had agreed with the danish broadcaster, dr, to produce a programme to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the eurovision song contest. the show, entitled after cliff richard's entry for the united kingdom, was held in copenhagen, and featured a competition among fourteen of the most popular songs from the last 50 years of the contest. a telephone vote was held to determine the most popular eurovision song of all-time, which was won by the abba song "waterloo" (winner for sweden in ). the event was hosted by the 1997 contest winner for the united kingdom, katrina leskanich, and latvia's representative on its debut at the 2000 contest, renārs kaupers.
in 2015, the ebu had decided again to commemorate the contest and agreed with the united kingdom's broadcaster, bbc, to produce a show for the 60th anniversary of the contest, after evaluating several proposals from member broadcasters in regards to the anniversary celebration beyond the 2015 contest in may. the event, entitled eurovision song contest's greatest hits, took place at the eventim apollo in hammersmith, london and featured fifteen acts from thirteen countries in the official line-up. unlike the 50th anniversary show in 2005 which was broadcast live, this event did not feature a competition and was pre-recorded to be televised across europe and other ebu members on various dates schedule by the respective broadcasters. the event was hosted by the british commentator for eurovision, graham norton, and the host of the 2013 and 2016 contest, petra mede.
the contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical and political content. for example, on rare occasions, certain countries have been booed when performing or receiving points, especially when being given by a neighbour country. most recently in 2014 and 2015, russia was heavily booed when it qualified for the final and received high points. the reason for the booing is considered to be due to the russian annexation of crimea and opposition to the country's policy on lgbt rights. fraser nelson wrote: "i can’t remember the last time i heard a eurovision audience boo anyone; during the iraq war in 2003, no one booed britain." due to the 2019 contest being held in israel, some people called on their national broadcasters to boycott the competition over israel's occupation of the west bank and the israeli–palestinian conflict. peter gabriel was among 50 artists who urged the bbc to ask for the contest to be moved out of israel. in response, the bbc said it was not appropriate "to use the bbc's participation for political reasons".
china's broadcaster mango tv, which broadcast 2018 contest for chinese audiences, was banned from broadcasting eurovision after it was revealed that mango tv censored ireland's same sex dance performance, along with censoring lgbt symbols and tattoos.
because the songs play to such a diverse supranational audience with contrasting musical tastes, and countries want to be able to appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, this has led to the music of the contest being characterised as a "mishmash of power ballads, ethnic rhythms and bubblegum pop". this well-established pattern, however, was notably broken in 2006 with finnish metal band lordi's victory. as eurovision is a visual show, many performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, notably elaborate lighting sequences and pyrotechnics; sometimes leading to bizarre on-stage theatrics and costumes, including the use of revealing dress.
the contest has long been accused by some of political bias; the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs. according to one study of eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the same way. another study concludes that as of 2006, voting blocs have, on at least two occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest. on the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music. a recent study in the journal of artificial societies and social simulation presents a new approach which allows an analysis of the whole time-line of the contest (from 1957 to 2017) to investigate collusion and the cluster blocks which have been changing. it allows the analysis to find collusive associations over time periods where the voting scheme is non-homogeneous. the results show a changing pattern in the collusive tendencies previously discussed. the current research into the analysis of the voting patterns has been used in notable sources, such as the economist, for investigating whether over 10-year periods such collusion is increasing or decreasing.
as an example, terry wogan, the united kingdom's well-known presenter of eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper stood down from bbc one's broadcast in 2008 saying "the voting used to be about the songs. now it's about national prejudices. we [the united kingdom] are on our own. we had a very good song, a very good singer, we came joint last. i don't want to be presiding over another debacle".
another influential factor is the high proportion of expatriates and ethnic minorities living in certain countries. although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.
the total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. for example, san marino holds the same voting power as russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.
to try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote. this hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals. however, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like cyprus and greece, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.
an overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. the concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. result of such a study are presented in this paper. from the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.
from 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the ebu executive supervisor and the reference group. an "allocation draw" occurs for the final and the semi-finals with each nation drawing to perform in the first or second half. prior to 2013, the order was decided at random (though when the host nation performs is still decided at random, to ensure fairness). there is some statistical evidence that the contest's results were positively related to the running number in 2009–2012. the change in procedure was aimed to make the show more exciting and ensure that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar from cancelling each other out. the decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans and participating broadcasters. some fans have alleged that there is a risk of corruption and that the order can be manipulated to benefit certain countries, since the running order is considered to be of importance to the result. as of the 2019 contest, the only regularly contested positions in the running order that have never won the contest are numbers 2 and 16, with position number 21 winning for the first time in 2016. position 17 has the most victories, with 7. positions 25, 26 and 27 have not won either, but there have been very few finals with that many participants.
a number of spin-offs and imitators of the eurovision song contest have been produced over the years, some national and others international.

nitrox refers to any gas mixture composed (excepting trace gases) of nitrogen and oxygen. this includes atmospheric air, which is approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases, primarily argon. in the usual application, underwater diving, nitrox is normally distinguished from air and handled differently. the most common use of nitrox mixtures containing oxygen in higher proportions than atmospheric air is in scuba diving, where the reduced partial pressure of nitrogen is advantageous in reducing nitrogen uptake in the body's tissues, thereby extending the practicable underwater dive time by reducing the decompression requirement, or reducing the risk of decompression sickness (also known as "the bends").
nitrox is used to a lesser extent in surface-supplied diving, as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire.
though not generally referred to as nitrox, an oxygen-enriched air mixture is routinely provided at normal surface ambient pressure as oxygen therapy to patients with compromised respiration and circulation.
reducing the proportion of nitrogen by increasing the proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of decompression sickness for the same dive profile, or allows extended dive times without increasing the need for decompression stops for the same risk. the significant aspect of extended no-stop time when using nitrox mixtures is reduced risk in a situation where breathing gas supply is compromised, as the diver can make a direct ascent to the surface with an acceptably low risk of decompression sickness. the exact values of the extended no-stop times vary depending on the decompression model used to derive the tables, but as an approximation, it is based on the partial pressure of nitrogen at the dive depth. this principle can be used to calculate an equivalent air depth (ead) with the same partial pressure of nitrogen as the mix to be used, and this depth is less than the actual dive depth for oxygen enriched mixtures. the equivalent air depth is used with air decompression tables to calculate decompression obligation and no-stop times. the goldman decompression model predicts a significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the padi tables suggest).
controlled tests have not shown breathing nitrox to reduce the effects of nitrogen narcosis, as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only to the use of nitrox. nonetheless, there are people in the diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox. this may be due to a dissociation of the subjective and behavioural effects of narcosis. although oxygen appears chemically more narcotic at the surface, relative narcotic effects at depth have never been studied in detail, but it is known that different gases produce different narcotic effects as depth increases. helium has no narcotic effect, but results in hpns when breathed at high pressures, which does not happen with gases that have greater narcotic potency. however, because of risks associated with oxygen toxicity, divers do not usually use nitrox at greater depths where more pronounced narcosis symptoms are more likely to occur. for deep diving, trimix or heliox gases are typically used; these gases contain helium to reduce the amount of narcotic gases in the mixture.
diving with and handling nitrox raise a number of potentially fatal dangers due to the high partial pressure of oxygen (ppo). nitrox is not a deep-diving gas mixture owing to the increased proportion of oxygen, which becomes toxic when breathed at high pressure. for example, the maximum operating depth of nitrox with 36% oxygen, a popular recreational diving mix, is to ensure a maximum ppo of no more than . the exact value of the maximum allowed ppo and maximum operating depth varies depending on factors such as the training agency, the type of dive, the breathing equipment and the level of surface support, with professional divers sometimes being allowed to breathe higher ppo than those recommended to recreational divers.
to dive safely with nitrox, the diver must learn good buoyancy control, a vital part of scuba diving in its own right, and a disciplined approach to preparing, planning and executing a dive to ensure that the ppo is known, and the maximum operating depth is not exceeded. many dive shops, dive operators, and gas blenders require the diver to present a nitrox certification card before selling nitrox to divers.
some training agencies, such as padi and technical diving international, teach the use of two depth limits to protect against oxygen toxicity. the shallower depth is called the "maximum operating depth" and is reached when the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas reaches . the deeper depth, called the "contingency depth", is reached when the partial pressure reaches . diving at or beyond this level exposes the diver to a greater risk of central nervous system (cns) oxygen toxicity. this can be extremely dangerous since its onset is often without warning and can lead to drowning, as the regulator may be spat out during convulsions, which occur in conjunction with sudden unconsciousness (general seizure induced by oxygen toxicity).
divers trained to use nitrox may memorise the acronym ventid-c or sometimes conventid, (which stands for vision (blurriness), ears (ringing sound), nausea, twitching, irritability, dizziness, and convulsions). however, evidence from non-fatal oxygen convulsions indicates that most convulsions are not preceded by any warning symptoms at all. further, many of the suggested warning signs are also symptoms of nitrogen narcosis, and so may lead to misdiagnosis by a diver. a solution to either is to ascend to a shallower depth.
use of nitrox may cause a reduced ventilatory response, and when breathing dense gas at the deeper limits of the usable range, this may result in carbon dioxide retention when exercise levels are high, with an increased risk of loss of consciousness.
there is anecdotal evidence that the use of nitrox reduces post-dive fatigue, particularly in older and or obese divers; however a double-blind study to test this found no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue. there was, however, some suggestion that post dive fatigue is due to sub-clinical decompression sickness (dcs) (i.e. micro bubbles in the blood insufficient to cause symptoms of dcs); the fact that the study mentioned was conducted in a dry chamber with an ideal decompression profile may have been sufficient to reduce sub-clinical dcs and prevent fatigue in both nitrox and air divers. in 2008, a study was published using wet divers at the same depth no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue was seen.
further studies with a number of different dive profiles, and also different levels of exertion, would be necessary to fully investigate this issue. for example, there is much better scientific evidence that breathing high-oxygen gases increases exercise tolerance, during aerobic exertion. though even moderate exertion while breathing from the regulator is a relatively uncommon occurrence in recreational scuba, as divers usually try to minimize it in order to conserve gas, episodes of exertion while regulator-breathing do occasionally occur in recreational diving. examples are surface-swimming a distance to a boat or beach after surfacing, where residual "safety" cylinder gas is often used freely, since the remainder will be wasted anyway when the dive is completed, and unplanned contingencies due to currents or buoyancy problems. it is possible that these so-far un-studied situations have contributed to some of the positive reputation of nitrox.
a 2010 study using critical flicker fusion frequency and perceived fatigue criteria found that diver alertness after a dive on nitrox was significantly better than after an air dive.
enriched air nitrox, nitrox with an oxygen content above 21%, is mainly used in scuba diving to reduce the proportion of nitrogen in the breathing gas mixture. the main benefit is reduced decompression risk. to a considerably lesser extent it is also used in surface supplied diving, where the logistics are relatively complex, similar to the use of other diving gas mixtures like heliox and trimix.
nitrox50 is used as one of the options in the first stages of therapeutic recompression using the comex cx 30 table for treatment of vestibular or general decompression sickness. nitrox is breathed at 30 msw and 24 msw and the ascents from these depths to the next stop. at 18m the gas is switched to oxygen for the rest of the treatment.
the use of oxygen at high altitudes or as oxygen therapy may be as supplementary oxygen, added to the inspired air, which would technically be a use of nitrox, blended on site, but this is not normally referred to as such, as the gas provided for the purpose is oxygen.
nitrox is known by many names: enriched air nitrox, oxygen enriched air, nitrox, eanx or safe air. since the word is a compound contraction or coined word and not an acronym, it should not be written in all upper case characters as "nitrox", but may be initially capitalized when referring to specific mixtures such as nitrox32, which contains 68% nitrogen and 32% oxygen. when one figure is stated, it refers to the oxygen percentage, not the nitrogen percentage. the original convention, nitrox68/32 became shortened as the first figure is redundant.
the term "nitrox" was originally used to refer to the breathing gas in a seafloor habitat where the oxygen has to be kept to a lower fraction than in air to avoid long term oxygen toxicity problems. it was later used by dr morgan wells of noaa for mixtures with an oxygen fraction higher than air, and has become a generic term for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen with any oxygen fraction, and in the context of recreational and technical diving, now usually refers to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with more than 21% oxygen. "enriched air nitrox" or "ean", and "oxygen enriched air" are used to emphasize richer than air mixtures. in "eanx", the "x" was originally the x of nitrox, but has come to indicate the percentage of oxygen in the mix and is replaced by a number when the percentage is known; for example a 40% oxygen mix is called ean40. the two most popular blends are ean32 and ean36, developed by noaa for scientific diving, and also named nitrox i and nitrox ii, respectively, or nitrox68/32 and nitrox64/36. these two mixtures were first utilized to the depth and oxygen limits for scientific diving designated by noaa at the time.
the term oxygen enriched air (oen) was accepted by the (american) scientific diving community, but although it is probably the most unambiguous and simply descriptive term yet proposed, it was resisted by the recreational diving community, sometimes in favour of less appropriate terminology.
in its early days of introduction to non-technical divers, nitrox has occasionally also been known by detractors by less complimentary terms, such as "devil gas" or "voodoo gas" (a term now sometimes used with pride).
american nitrox divers international (andi) uses the term "safeair", which they define as any oxygen-enriched air mixture with o concentrations between 22% and 50% that meet their gas quality and handling specifications, and specifically claim that these mixtures are safer than normally produced breathing air. considering the complexities and hazards of mixing, handling, analyzing, and using oxygen-enriched air, this name is considered inappropriate by those who consider that it is not inherently "safe", but merely has decompression advantages.
the constituent gas percentages are what the gas blender aims for, but the final actual mix may vary from the specification, and so a small flow of gas from the cylinder must be measured with an oxygen analyzer, before the cylinder is used underwater.
maximum operating depth (mod) is the maximum safe depth at which a given nitrox mixture can be used. mod depends on the allowed partial pressure of oxygen, which is related to exposure time and the acceptable risk assumed for central nervous system oxygen toxicity. acceptable maximum ppo varies depending on the application:
higher values are used by commercial and military divers in special circumstances, often when the diver uses surface supplied breathing apparatus, or for treatment in a chamber, where the airway is relatively secure.
the two most common recreational diving nitrox mixes contain 32% and 36% oxygen, which have maximum operating depths (mods) of and respectively when limited to a maximum partial pressure of oxygen of . divers may calculate an equivalent air depth to determine their decompression requirements or may use nitrox tables or a nitrox-capable dive computer.
nitrox with more than 40% oxygen is uncommon within recreational diving. there are two main reasons for this: the first is that all pieces of diving equipment that come into contact with mixes containing higher proportions of oxygen, particularly at high pressure, need special cleaning and servicing to reduce the risk of fire. the second reason is that richer mixes extend the time the diver can stay underwater without needing decompression stops far further than the duration permitted by the capacity of typical diving cylinders. for example, based on the padi nitrox recommendations, the maximum operating depth for ean45 would be and the maximum dive time available at this depth even with ean36 is nearly 1 hour 15 minutes: a diver with a breathing rate of 20 litres per minute using twin 10-litre, 230-bar (about double 85 cu. ft.) cylinders would have completely emptied the cylinders after 1 hour 14 minutes at this depth.
use of nitrox mixtures containing 50% to 80% oxygen is common in technical diving as decompression gas, which by virtue of its lower partial pressure of inert gases such as nitrogen and helium, allows for more efficient (faster) elimination of these gases from the tissues than leaner oxygen mixtures.
in deep open circuit technical diving, where hypoxic gases are breathed during the bottom portion of the dive, a nitrox mix with 50% or less oxygen called a "travel mix" is sometimes breathed during the beginning of the descent in order to avoid hypoxia. normally, however, the most oxygen-lean of the diver's decompression gases would be used for this purpose, since descent time spent reaching a depth where bottom mix is no longer hypoxic is normally small, and the distance between this depth and the mod of any nitrox decompression gas is likely to be very short, if it occurs at all.
the composition of a nitrox mix can be optimized for a given planned dive profile. this is termed "best mix", for the dive, and provides the maximum no-decompression time compatible with acceptable oxygen exposure. an acceptable maximum partial pressure of oxygen is selected based on depth and planned bottom time, and this value is used to calculate the oxygen content of the best mix for the dive:
there are several methods of production:
any diving cylinder containing a blend of gasses other than standard air is required by most diver training organizations, and some national governments, to be clearly marked to indicate the current gas mixture. in practice it is common to use a printed adhesive label to indicate the type of gas (in this case nitrox), and to add a temporary label to specify the analysis of the current mix.
training standards for nitrox certification suggest the composition must be verified by the diver by using an oxygen analyzer before use.
within the eu, valves with m26x2 outlet thread are recommended for cylinders with increased oxygen content. regulators for use with these cylinders require compatible connectors, and are not directly connectable with cylinders for compressed air.
a german standard specifies that any mixture with an oxygen content greater than atmospheric air must be treated as pure oxygen. a nitrox cylinder is specially cleaned and identified. the cylinder colour is overall white with the letter n on opposite sides of the cylinder. the fraction of oxygen in the bottle is checked after filling and marked on the cylinder.
south african national standard 10019:2008 specifies the colour of all scuba cylinders as golden yellow with french gray shoulder. this applies to all underwater breathing gases except medical oxygen, which must be carried in cylinders that are black with a white shoulder. nitrox cylinders must be identified by a transparent, self-adhesive label with green lettering, fitted below the shoulder. in effect this is green lettering on a yellow cylinder, with a gray shoulder. the composition of the gas must also be specified on the label. in practice this is done by a small additional self-adhesive label with the oxygen fraction, which is changed when a new mix is filled.
every nitrox cylinder should also have a sticker stating whether or not the cylinder is "oxygen clean" and suitable for partial pressure blending. any oxygen-clean cylinder may have any mix up to 100% oxygen inside. if by some accident an oxygen-clean cylinder is filled at a station that does not supply gas to oxygen-clean standards it is then considered contaminated and must be re-cleaned before a gas containing more than 40% oxygen may again be added. cylinders marked as 'not oxygen clean' may only be filled with oxygen-enriched air mixtures from membrane or stick blending systems where the gas is mixed before being added to the cylinder, and to an oxygen fraction not exceeding 40% by volume.
use of a gas mix which differs from the planned mix introduces an increased risk of decompression sickness or an increased risk of oxygen toxicity, depending on the error. it may be possible to simply recalculate the dive plan or set the dive computer accordingly, but in some cases the planned dive may not be practicable.
many training agencies such as padi, cmas, ssi and naui train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. if the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the planned mix, the diver must either recalculate the dive plan with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. under iantd and andi rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen fraction before taking delivery), and the calculated maximum operating depth for that mix. all of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations as each diver must use the specific cylinder they have checked out.
in south africa, the national standard for handling and filling portable cylinders with pressurised gases (sans 10019) requires that the cylinder be labelled with a sticker identifying the contents as nitrox, and specifying the oxygen fraction. similar requirements may apply in other countries.
partial pressure blending using pure oxygen decanted into the cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute a relatively high fire hazard. this procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. partial pressure blending using pure oxygen is often used to provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.
any gas which contains a significantly larger percentage of oxygen than air is a fire hazard, and such gases can react with hydrocarbons or lubricants and sealing materials inside the filling system to produce toxic gases, even if a fire is not apparent. some organisations exempt equipment from oxygen-clean standards if the oxygen fraction is limited to 40% or less.
among recreational training agencies, only andi subscribes to the guideline of requiring oxygen cleaning for equipment used with more than 23% oxygen fraction. the uscg, noaa, u.s. navy, osha, and the other recreational training agencies accept the limit as 40% as no accident or incident has been known to occur when this guideline has been properly applied. tens of thousands of recreational divers are trained each year and the overwhelming majority of these divers are taught the "over 40% rule". most nitrox fill stations which supply pre-mixed nitrox will fill cylinders with mixtures below 40% without certification of cleanliness for oxygen service. luxfer cylinders specify oxygen cleaning for all mixtures exceeding 23.5% oxygen.
the following references for oxygen cleaning specifically cite the "over 40%" guideline that has been in widespread use since the 1960s, and consensus at the 1992 enriched air workshop was to accept that guideline and continue the status quo.
much of the confusion appears to be a result of misapplying pvho (pressure vessel for human occupancy) guidelines which prescribe a maximum ambient oxygen content of 25% when a human is sealed into a pressure vessel (chamber). the concern here is for a fire hazard to a living person who could be trapped in an oxygen-rich burning environment.
of the three commonly applied methods of producing enriched air mixes - continuous blending, partial pressure blending, and membrane separation systems - only partial pressure blending would require the valve and cylinder components to be oxygen cleaned for mixtures with less than 40% oxygen. the other two methods ensure that the equipment is never subjected to greater than 40% oxygen content.
in a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. if the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. if the vessel contents are ignitable or a contaminant is present this event may result in a "fireball".
in 1874, henry fleuss made what was possibly the first nitrox dive using a rebreather.
in 1911 draeger of germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a standard diving suit. this concept was produced and marketed as the dm20 oxygen rebreather system and the dm40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. the dm40 was rated for depths up to 40m.
christian j. lambertsen proposed calculations for nitrogen addition to prevent oxygen toxicity in divers utilizing nitrogen-oxygen rebreather diving.
in world war ii or soon after, british commando frogmen and clearance divers started occasionally diving with oxygen rebreathers adapted for semi-closed-circuit nitrox (which they called "mixture") diving by fitting larger cylinders and carefully setting the gas flow rate using a flow meter. these developments were kept secret until independently duplicated by civilians in the 1960s.
lambertson published a paper on nitrox in 1947.
in the 1950s the united states navy (usn) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the us navy diving manual.
in 1955, e. lanphier described the use of nitrogen-oxygen diving mixtures, and the equivalent air depth method for calculating decompression from air tables.
in the 1960s, a. galerne used on-line blending for commercial diving.
in 1970, morgan wells, who was the first director of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration (noaa) diving center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. he introduced the concept of equivalent air depth (ead). he also developed a process for mixing oxygen and air which he called a continuous blending system. for many years wells' invention was the only practical alternative to partial pressure blending. in 1979 noaa published wells' procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the noaa diving manual.
in 1985 dick rutkowski, a former noaa diving safety officer, formed iand (international association of nitrox divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. this was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community.
in 1989, the harbor branch oceanographic institution workshop addressed blending, oxygen limits and decompression issues.
in 1991, bove, bennett and "skindiver" magazine took a stand against nitrox use for recreational diving. the annual dema show (held in houston, texas that year) banned nitrox training providers from the show. this caused a backlash, and when dema relented, a number of organizations took the opportunity to present nitrox workshops outside the show.
in 1992, the scuba diving resources group organised a workshop where some guidelines were established, and some misconceptions addressed.
in 1992 bsac banned its members from using nitrox during bsac activities. iand's name was changed to the international association of nitrox and technical divers (iantd), the t being added when the european association of technical divers (eatd) merged with iand. in the early 1990s, these agencies were teaching nitrox, but the main scuba agencies were not. additional new organizations, including the american nitrox divers international (andi) - which invented the term "safe air" for marketing purposes - and technical diving international (tdi) were begun. naui became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox.
meanwhile, diving stores were finding a purely economic reason to offer nitrox: not only was an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. with the new dive computers which could be programmed to allow for the longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased.
in 1993 "skin diver" magazine, the leading recreational diving publication at the time, published a three-part series arguing that nitrox was unsafe for sport divers. diverite manufactured the first nitrox-compatible dive computer, called the bridge, the aquacorps tek93 conference was held in san francisco, and a practicable oil limit of 0.1 mg/m for oxygen compatible air was set. the canadian armed forces issued ead tables with an upper po of 1.5 ata.
in 1994 bsac reversed its policy on nitrox and announced bsac nitrox training to start in 1995
in 1996, the professional association of diving instructors (padi) announced full educational support for nitrox. while other mainline scuba organizations had announced their support of nitrox earlier, it was padi's endorsement that established nitrox as a standard recreational diving option.
in 1999 a survey by r.w. hamilton showed that over hundreds of thousands of nitrox dives, the dcs record is good. nitrox had become popular with recreational divers, but not used much by commercial divers who tend to use surface supplied breathing apparatus. the osha accepted a petition for a variance from the commercial diving regulations for recreational scuba instructors.
the 2001 edition of the "noaa diving manual" included a chapter intended for nitrox training.
at times in the geological past the earth's atmosphere contained much more than 20% oxygen: e.g. up to 35% in the upper carboniferous period. this let animals absorb oxygen more easily and influenced their evolutionary patterns.

éric alfred leslie satie (; 17 may 18661 july 1925), who signed his name erik satie after 1884, was a french composer and pianist. satie was an influential artist in the late 19th- and early 20th-century parisian avant-garde. his work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the theatre of the absurd.
an eccentric, satie was introduced as a "gymnopedist" in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the "gymnopédies". later, he also referred to himself as a "phonometrician" (meaning "someone who measures sounds"), preferring this designation to that of "musician", after having been called "a clumsy but subtle technician" in a book on contemporary french composers published in 1911.
in addition to his body of music, satie was "a thinker with a gift of eloquence" who left a remarkable set of writings, having contributed work for a range of publications, from the dadaist "391" to the american culture chronicle "vanity fair". although in later life he prided himself on publishing his work under his own name, in the late 19th century he appears to have used pseudonyms such as virginie lebeau and françois de paule in some of his published writings.
erik satie was born on 17 may 1866, the son of alfred satie and his wife jane leslie (née anton), who was born in london to scottish parents. erik was born at honfleur in normandy; his childhood home there is now open to the public. when satie was four years old, his family moved to paris, his father having been offered a translator's job in the capital. after his mother's death in 1872, he was sent (at age 6), together with his younger brother, conrad, back to honfleur to live with his paternal grandparents. there he received his first music lessons from a local organist. in 1878, when he was 12 years old, his grandmother died, and the two brothers were reunited in paris with their father, who remarried (to a piano teacher) shortly afterwards. from the early 1880s onwards, satie started publishing salon compositions by his step-mother and himself, among others.
in 1879, satie entered the paris conservatoire, where he was soon labelled untalented by his teachers. georges mathias, his professor of piano at the conservatoire, described his pupil's piano technique in flatly negative terms, "insignificant and laborious" and "worthless". émile decombes called him "the laziest student in the conservatoire". years later, satie related that mathias, with great insistence, had told him that his real talent lay in composing. after being sent home for two and a half years, he was readmitted to the conservatoire at the end of 1885 (age 19), but was unable to make a more favourable impression on his teachers than he had before, and, as a result, resolved to take up military service a year later. however, satie's military career did not last very long; within a few months he was discharged after deliberately infecting himself with bronchitis.
satie moved from his father's residence to lodgings in montmartre in 1887, when he became 21. by this time he had started what was to be an enduring friendship with the romantic poet patrice contamine, and had his first compositions published by his father. he soon integrated with the artistic clientele of the le chat noir café-cabaret, and started publishing his "gymnopédies". publication of compositions in the same vein (', ', etc.) followed. in the same period he befriended claude debussy. he moved to a smaller room, still in montmartre (, now a museum), in 1890. by 1891 he was the official composer and chapel-master of the rosicrucian order "", led by , which led to compositions such as ', "le fils des étoiles", and the '. satie gave performances at the salon de la rose + croix, organized by péladan.
by mid-1892, satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own making ('), provided incidental music to a chivalric esoteric play (two '), had his first hoax published (announcing the premiere of "", an anti-wagnerian opera he probably never composed), and broken from péladan, starting that autumn with the "uspud" project, a "christian ballet", in collaboration with . while the comrades from both the and sympathised, a promotional brochure was produced for the project, which reads as a pamphlet for a new esoteric sect.
satie and suzanne valadon (an artists' model, artist, long-time friend of miguel utrillo, and mother of maurice utrillo) began an affair early in 1893. after their first night together, he proposed marriage. the two did not marry, but valadon moved to a room next to satie's at the . satie became obsessed with her, calling her his "" and writing impassioned notes about "her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet". during their relationship, satie composed the "danses gothiques" as a means of calming his mind, and valadon painted a portrait of satie, which she gave to him. after six months she moved away, leaving satie broken-hearted. afterwards, he said that he was left with "nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness". it is believed this was the only intimate relationship satie ever had.
in 1893, satie met the young maurice ravel for the first time, satie's style emerging in the first compositions of the youngster. one of satie's own compositions of that period, "vexations", was to remain undisclosed until after his death. by the end of the year he had founded the (metropolitan art church of jesus the conductor). as its only member, in the role of "parcier et maître de chapelle", he started to compose a "" (later to become known as the "messe des pauvres"), and wrote a flood of letters, articles and pamphlets showing off his self-assuredness in religious and artistic matters. to give an example: he applied for membership in the académie française twice, leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organisation (presided over by camille saint-saëns) as much as owed him such membership. such proceedings without doubt rather helped to wreck his popularity in the cultural establishment. in 1895 he inherited some money, allowing him to have more of his writings printed, and to change from wearing a priest-like habit to being the "velvet gentleman".
by mid-1896, all of satie's financial means had vanished, and he had to move to cheaper and much smaller lodgings, first at the , and two years later, after he had composed the two first sets of "" in 1897, to arcueil, a suburb some five kilometres from the centre of paris. during this period he re-established contact with his brother conrad for numerous practical and financial matters, disclosing some of his inner feelings in the process. the letters to conrad made it clear that he had set aside his religious ideas.
from 1899 on, satie started making money as a cabaret pianist, adapting over a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own. the most popular of these were ', text by henry pacory; ', text by vincent hyspa; ', a waltz; "la diva de l'empire", text by dominique bonnaud/numa blès; ', a march; ', text by contamine de latour (lost, but the music later reappears in '); and quite a few more, many of which have been lost. in his later years, satie would reject all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature, but for the time being, it was an income.
only a few compositions that satie took seriously remain from this period: "jack in the box", music to a pantomime by jules depaquit (called a "" by satie); "", a short comic opera on a serious theme, text by "lord cheminot"; "the dreamy fish", piano music to accompany a lost tale by cheminot; and a few others that were mostly incomplete, hardly any of them staged, and none of them published at the time.
both ' and "the dreamy fish" have been analysed by ornella volta as containing elements of competition with claude debussy, of which debussy was probably not aware, satie not making this music public. meanwhile, debussy was having one of his first major successes with ' in 1902, leading a few years later to 'who-was-precursor-to-whom' debates between the two composers, in which maurice ravel would also get involved.
in october 1905, satie enrolled in vincent d'indy's schola cantorum de paris to study classical counterpoint while still continuing his cabaret work. most of his friends were as dumbfounded as the professors at the schola when they heard about his new plan to return to the classrooms, especially as d'indy was an admiring pupil of saint-saëns, not particularly favoured by satie. satie would follow these courses at the schola, as a respected pupil, for more than five years, receiving a first (intermediate) diploma in 1908. some of his classroom counterpoint-exercises, such as the "", were published after his death. another summary, of the period prior to the schola, also appeared in 1911: the "trois morceaux en forme de poire", which was a kind of compilation of the best of what he had written up to 1903.
something that becomes clear through these published compilations is that satie did not so much reject romanticism and its exponents like wagner, but that he rejected certain aspects of it. from his first composition to his last, he rejected the idea of musical development, in the strict definition of this term: the intertwining of different themes in a development section of a sonata form. as a result, his contrapuntal and other works were very short; the "new, modern" fugues do not extend further than the exposition of the theme(s). generally, he would say that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary. also melodrama, in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of "spoken words to a background of music", was something satie avoided. his 1913 "le piège de méduse" could be seen as an absurdist spoof of that genre.
in the meantime, other changes had also taken place: satie was a member of a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the communist party in that area after december 1920), and had socialised with the arcueil community: amongst other things, he had been involved in the "" work for children. he also changed his appearance to that of the 'bourgeois functionary' with bowler hat, umbrella, etc. he channelled his medieval interests into a peculiar secret hobby: in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings, most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal, which he drew on little cards. occasionally, extending the game, he would publish anonymous small announcements in local journals, offering some of these buildings, e.g., a "castle in lead", for sale or rent.
a rare autochrome photograph of satie exists that dates from 1911. it was reproduced on the cover of robert orledge's second book on the composer, "satie remembered" (1995), but where this autochrome was found has not been made known.
starting in 1912, satie's new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful, and he wrote and published many of these over the next few years (most of them premiered by the pianist ricardo viñes). his habit of accompanying the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks was now well established, so that a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances. he wrote in the first edition of "heures séculaires et instantanées", "to whom it may concern: 'i forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance. ignorance of my instructions will incur my righteous indignation against the presumptuous culprit. no exception will be allowed.'" he had mostly stopped using barlines by this time. in some ways, these compositions were very reminiscent of rossini's compositions from the final years of his life, grouped under the name péchés de vieillesse.
however, the acceleration in satie's life did not come so much from the success of his new piano pieces; it was ravel who inadvertently triggered the characteristics of satie's remaining years and thus influenced the successive progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly manifested themselves in paris over the following years. paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world, and the beginning of the new century appeared to have set many minds on fire. in 1910 the "", a group of young musicians around ravel, proclaimed their preference for satie's earlier work from before the schola period, reinforcing the idea that satie had been a precursor of debussy.
at first, satie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention, but when he realised that this meant that his more recent work was overlooked or dismissed, he looked for other young artists who related better to his more recent ideas, so as to have better mutual support in creative activity. thus, young artists such as roland-manuel, and later georges auric, and jean cocteau, started to receive more of his attention than the "".
as a result of his contact with roland-manuel, satie again began publicising his thoughts, with far more irony than he had done before (amongst other things, the ' and ').
with jean cocteau, whom he had first met in 1915, satie started work on incidental music for a production of shakespeare's "a midsummer night's dream", resulting in the "cinq grimaces pour le songe d'une nuit d'été". from 1916, he and cocteau worked on the ballet "parade", which was premiered in 1917 by sergei diaghilev's ballets russes, with sets and costumes by pablo picasso, and choreography by léonide massine. through picasso, satie also became acquainted with other cubists, such as georges braque, with whom he would work on other, aborted, projects.
with georges auric, louis durey, arthur honegger, and germaine tailleferre, satie formed the nouveaux jeunes, shortly after writing "parade". later, the group was joined by francis poulenc and darius milhaud. in september 1918, satie – giving little or no explanation – withdrew from the . jean cocteau gathered the six remaining members, forming the groupe des six (to which satie would later have access, but later again would fall out with most of its members).
from 1919, satie was in contact with tristan tzara, the initiator of the dada movement. he became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement, such as francis picabia (later to become a surrealist), andré derain, marcel duchamp, jean hugo and man ray, among others. on the day of his first meeting with man ray, the two fabricated the artist's first readymade: "the gift" (1921). satie contributed writing to the dadaist publication "391". in the first months of 1922, he was surprised to find himself entangled in the argument between tzara and andré breton about the true nature of avant-garde art, epitomised by the failure of the congrès de paris. satie originally sided with tzara, but managed to maintain friendly relations with most players in both camps. meanwhile, an "" had formed around satie, taking the name from the relatively remote district of paris where satie lived; it included young musicians such as henri sauguet, maxime jacob, roger désormière and henri cliquet-pleyel.
other work and episodes in this last period of satie's life:
satie's last compositions were two 1924 ballets. "mercure" reunited him with picasso and massine for a mythological spoof produced by count étienne de beaumont's soirées de paris, and he wrote the "" ballet ' in collaboration with picabia, for the of rolf de maré. in a simultaneous project, satie added music to the surrealist film ' by rené clair, which was given as an intermezzo for "".
after years of heavy drinking (including consumption of absinthe), satie died at age 59, on 1 july 1925 from cirrhosis of the liver. he is buried in the cemetery in arcueil. there is a tiny stone monument designating a grassy area in front of an apartment building – ' erik satie'. over the course of his 27 years in residence at arcueil, where satie lived in stark simplicity, no one had ever visited his room. after his death, satie's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos. among many other unsorted papers and miscellaneous items, it contained a large number of umbrellas, and two grand pianos placed one on top of the other, the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels. they discovered compositions that were either thought to have been lost or totally unknown. the score to "jack in the box" was thought, by satie, to have been left on a bus years before. these were found behind the piano, in the pockets of his velvet suits, and in other odd places, and included "vexations"; "geneviève de brabant" and other unpublished or unfinished stage works; "the dreamy fish"; many schola cantorum exercises; a previously unseen set of "canine" piano pieces; and several other works for piano, many untitled. some of these would be published later as additional ', ', "", and "furniture music".
satie's writings include:

in integral calculus, elliptic integrals originally arose in connection with the problem of giving the arc length of an ellipse. they were first studied by giulio fagnano and leonhard euler (). modern mathematics defines an "elliptic integral" as any function which can be expressed in the form
where is a rational function of its two arguments, is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4 with no repeated roots, and is a constant.
in general, integrals in this form cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. exceptions to this general rule are when has repeated roots, or when contains no odd powers of . however, with the appropriate reduction formula, every elliptic integral can be brought into a form that involves integrals over rational functions and the three legendre canonical forms (i.e. the elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind).
besides the legendre form given below, the elliptic integrals may also be expressed in carlson symmetric form. additional insight into the theory of the elliptic integral may be gained through the study of the schwarz–christoffel mapping. historically, elliptic functions were discovered as inverse functions of elliptic integrals.
"incomplete elliptic integrals" are functions of two arguments; "complete elliptic integrals" are functions of a single argument. these arguments are expressed in a variety of different but equivalent ways (they give the same elliptic integral). most texts adhere to a canonical naming scheme, using the following naming conventions.
for expressing one argument:
each of the above three quantities is completely determined by any of the others (given that they are non-negative). thus, they can be used interchangeably.

in this notation, the use of a vertical bar as delimiter indicates that the argument following it is the "parameter" (as defined above), while the backslash indicates that it is the modular angle. the use of a semicolon implies that the argument preceding it is the sine of the amplitude:
this potentially confusing use of different argument delimiters is traditional in elliptic integrals and much of the notation is compatible with that used in the reference book by abramowitz and stegun and that used in the integral tables by gradshteyn and ryzhik.

thus, the jacobian elliptic functions are inverses to the elliptic integrals.
there are still other conventions for the notation of elliptic integrals employed in the literature. the notation with interchanged arguments, , is often encountered; and similarly for the integral of the second kind. abramowitz and stegun substitute the integral of the first kind, , for the argument in their definition of the integrals of the second and third kinds, unless this argument is followed by a vertical bar: i.e. for . moreover, their complete integrals employ the "parameter" as argument in place of the modulus , i.e. rather than . and the integral of the third kind defined by gradshteyn and ryzhik, , puts the amplitude first and not the "characteristic" .
thus one must be careful with the notation when using these functions, because various reputable references and software packages use different conventions in the definitions of the elliptic functions. for example, some references, and wolfram's mathematica software and wolfram alpha, define the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in terms of the parameter , instead of the elliptic modulus .

legendre's relation:

the epistle to the romans or letter to the romans, often shortened to romans, is the sixth book in the new testament. biblical scholars agree that it was composed by the apostle paul to explain that salvation is offered through the gospel of jesus christ. it is the longest of the pauline epistles.
in the opinion of jesuit scholar joseph fitzmyer, the book "overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of the justification and salvation of jew and greek alike by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ, revealing the uprightness and love of god the father."
n. t. wright notes that romans is
the scholarly consensus is that paul wrote the epistle to the romans.
c. e. b. cranfield, in the introduction to his commentary on romans, says:
the denial of paul's authorship of romans by such critics ... is now rightly relegated to a place among the curiosities of nt scholarship. today no responsible criticism disputes its pauline origin. the evidence of its use in the apostolic fathers is clear, and before the end of the second century it is listed and cited as paul's. every extant early list of nt books includes it among his letters. the external evidence of authenticity could indeed hardly be stronger; and it is altogether borne out by the internal evidence, linguistic, stylistic, literary, historical and theological.
the letter was most probably written while paul was in corinth, probably while he was staying in the house of gaius, and transcribed by tertius, his amanuensis. there are a number of reasons why corinth is considered most plausible. paul was about to travel to jerusalem on writing the letter, which matches acts where it is reported that paul stayed for three months in greece. this probably implies corinth as it was the location of paul's greatest missionary success in greece. additionally, phoebe was a deacon of the church in cenchreae, a port to the east of corinth, and would have been able to convey the letter to rome after passing through corinth and taking a ship from corinth's west port. erastus, mentioned in , also lived in corinth, being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in corinth.
the precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the collection for jerusalem had been assembled and paul was about to "go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints", that is, at the close of his second visit to greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city. the majority of scholars writing on romans propose the letter was written in late 55/early 56 or late 56/early 57. early 55 and early 58 both have some support, while german new testament scholar gerd lüdemann argues for a date as early as 51/52 (or 54/55), following on from knox, who proposed 53/54. lüdemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s.
some manuscripts have a subscription at the end of the epistle:
for ten years before writing the letter (approx. 47–57), paul had traveled around the territories bordering the aegean sea evangelizing. churches had been planted in the roman provinces of galatia, macedonia, achaia and asia. paul, considering his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in spain, where he would not "build upon another man’s foundation". this allowed him to visit rome on the way, a long-time ambition of his. the letter to the romans, in part, prepares them and gives reasons for his visit.
in addition to paul's geographic location, his religious views are important. first, paul was a hellenistic jew with a pharisaic background (see gamaliel), integral to his identity: see paul the apostle and judaism for details. his concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter. second, the other side of the dialogue is paul's conversion and calling to follow christ in the early 30s.
the most probable ancient account of the beginning of christianity in rome is given by a 4th-century writer known as ambrosiaster:
from adam clarke:
at this time, the jews made up a substantial number in rome, and their synagogues, frequented by many, enabled the gentiles to become acquainted with the story of jesus of nazareth. consequently, churches composed of both jews and gentiles were formed at rome. according to irenaeus, a 2nd-century church father, the church at rome was founded directly by the apostles peter and paul. however, many modern scholars disagree with irenaeus, holding that while little is known of the circumstances of the church's founding, it was not founded by paul:
note the large number of names in of those then in rome, and verses 5, 15 and 16 indicate there was more than one church assembly or company of believers in rome. verse 5 mentions a church that met in the house of aquila and priscilla. verses 14 and 15 each mention groupings of believers and saints.
jews were expelled from rome because of disturbances around ad 49 by the edict of claudius. fitzmyer claims that both jews and jewish christians were expelled as a result of their infighting. claudius died around the year ad 54, and his successor, emperor nero, allowed the jews back into rome, but then, after the great fire of rome of 64, christians were persecuted. fitzmyer argues that with the return of the jews to rome in 54 new conflict arose between the gentile christians and the jewish christians who had formerly been expelled. keck thinks gentile christians may have developed a dislike of or looked down on jews (see also antisemitism and responsibility for the death of jesus), because they theologically rationalized that jews were no longer god's people.
scholars often have difficulty assessing whether romans is a letter or an epistle, a relevant distinction in form-critical analysis:
a letter is something non-literary, a means of communication between persons who are separated from each other. confidential and personal in nature, it is intended only for the person or persons to whom it is addressed, and not at all for the public or any kind of publicity...an epistle is an artistic literary form, just like the dialogue, the oration, or the drama. it has nothing in common with the letter except its form: apart from that one might venture the paradox that the epistle is the opposite of a real letter. the contents of the epistle are intended for publicity—they aim at interesting "the public."
joseph fitzmyer argues, from evidence put forth by stirewalt, that the style of romans is an "essay-letter." philip melanchthon, a writer during the reformation, suggested that romans was "caput et summa universae doctrinae christianae" ("a summary of all christian doctrine"). while some scholars suggest, like melanchthon, that it is a type of theological treatise, this view largely ignores chapters 14 and 15 of romans. there are also many "noteworthy elements" missing from romans that are included in other areas of the pauline corpus. the breakdown of romans as a treatise began with f.c. baur in 1836 when he suggested "this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical circumstances in which paul wrote it."
paul sometimes uses a style of writing common in his time called a "diatribe". he appears to be responding to a "heckler" (probably an imaginary one based on paul's encounters with real objections in his previous preaching), and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. in the flow of the letter, paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the jewish members of the church, sometimes the gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole.
to review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of romans, along with a bibliography, see "dictionary of paul and his letters". for a 16th-century "lollard" reformer view, see the work of william tyndale. in his prologue to his translation of the book of romans, which was largely taken from the prologue of german reformer martin luther, tyndale writes that:
... this epistle is the principal and most excellent part of the new testament, and most pure evangelion, that is to say glad tidings and what we call the gospel, and also a light and a way in unto the whole scripture ... the sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle, is, to prove that a man is justified by faith only: which proposition whoso denieth, to him is not only this epistle and all that paul writeth, but also the whole scripture, so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health. and to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth, paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt, yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking, that it is impossible for her to keep the law in the sight of god.
this essay-letter composed by paul was written to a specific audience at a specific time; to understand it, the situations of both paul and the recipients must be understood.
the introduction provides some general notes about paul. he introduces here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to the church at rome. jesus' human line stems from david. paul, however, does not limit his ministry to jews. paul's goal is that the gentiles would also hear the gospel.
he commends the romans for their faith. paul also speaks of the past obstacles that have blocked his coming to rome earlier.
paul's announcement that he is not "ashamed" ("epaiscúnomai") of his gospel because it holds power ("dúnamis"). these two verses form a backdrop for the rest of the book. first, we note that paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about jesus christ. he also notes that he is speaking to the "jew first." there is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of paul the apostle and judaism is still debated. we are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. wayne brindle argues, based on paul's former writings against the judaizers in galatians and 2 corinthians, that rumors had probably spread about paul totally negating the jewish existence in a christian world (see also antinomianism in the new testament and supersessionism). paul may have used the "jew first" approach to counter such a view.
paul now begins into the main thrust of his letter. he begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there will be wrath from god. people have taken god's invisible image and made him into an idol. paul draws heavily here from the wisdom of solomon. he condemns unnatural sexual behavior and warns that such behavior will result in a depraved body and mind ("reprobate mind" in the king james version) and says that people who do such things (including murder and wickedness ) are worthy of death. paul stands firmly against the idol worship system which was common in rome. several scholars believe the passage is a non-pauline interpolation.
on the traditional protestant interpretation, paul here calls out jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they themselves are also not following the law. stanley stowers, however, has argued on rhetorical grounds that paul is in these verses not addressing a jew at all but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person (ὁ ἀλαζων). stowers writes, "there is absolutely no justification for reading as paul's attack on 'the hypocrisy of the jew.' no one in the first century would have identified "ho alazon" with judaism. that popular interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later christian characterizations of jews as 'hypocritical pharisees'". see also anti-judaism.
paul says that a righteousness from god has made itself known apart from the law, to which the law and prophets testify, and this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus to all who believe. he describes justification – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of god, and not the work of man (lest he might boast), but by faith.
in chapters five through eight, paul argues that believers can be assured of their hope in salvation, having been freed from the bondage of sin. paul teaches that through faith, the faithful have been joined with jesus and freed from sin. believers should celebrate in the assurance of salvation and be certain that no external force or party can take their salvation away from them. this promise is open to everyone since everyone has sinned, save the one who paid for all of them.
in paul addresses the faithfulness of god to the israelites, where he says that god has been faithful to his promise. paul hopes that all israelites will come to realize the truth since he himself is also an israelite, and had in the past been a persecutor of early christians. in paul talks about how the nation of israel has been cast away, and the conditions under which israel will be god's chosen nation again: when israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief.
in , paul says that humans are under the law while we live: "know ye not...that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?" however, jesus' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law (, "wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the body of christ"), according to an antinomistic interpretation.
from chapter 12 through the first part of chapter 15, paul outlines how the gospel transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. this transformation is described as a "renewing of your mind" (12:2), a transformation that douglas j. moo characterizes as “the heart of the matter.” it is a transformation so radical that it amounts to “a transfiguration of your brain,” a "metanoia", a “mental revolution.”
paul goes on to describe how believers should live. christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of moses, but under the grace of god, see law and grace. we do not need to live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed, we will know "almost instinctively" what god wants of us. the law then provides an "objective standard" for judging progress in the "lifelong process" of our mind's renewal.
to the extent they have been set free from sin by renewed minds (romans 6:18), believers are no longer bound to sin. believers are free to live in obedience to god and love everybody. as paul says in romans 13:10, "love (ἀγάπη) worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law".
the fragment in romans 13:1–7 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example james kallas, to be an interpolation. (see also the great commandment and christianity and politics). paul tillich accepts the historical authenticity of romans 13:1–7, but claims it has been misinterpreted by churches with an anti-revolutionary bias:
one of the many politico-theological abuses of biblical statements is the understanding of paul’s words [romans 13:1–7] as justifying the anti-revolutionary bias of some churches, particularly the lutheran. but neither these words nor any other new testament statement deals with the methods of gaining political power. in romans, paul is addressing eschatological enthusiasts, not a revolutionary political movement.
the concluding verses contain a description of his travel plans, personal greetings and salutations. one-third of the twenty-one christians identified in the greetings are women. additionally, none of these christians answer to the name peter, although according to the catholic tradition, he had been ruling as pope in rome for about 25 years. possibly related was the incident at antioch between paul and cephas.
roman catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to for the necessity of living a virtuous life as well:
but by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when god's righteous judgment will be revealed. for he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. there will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the jew first and also the greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the jew first and also the greek. for god shows no partiality.
throughout his writings, st. augustine strongly affirms the catholic understanding of this and other such scriptural admonitions. in his sermons to his catholic congregations, he is especially careful to warn them against an inordinate desire for a complete assurance of salvation. in his "exposition of psalm 147" for example, he states:
the gospel warned us, "be on the watch for the last day, the day when the son of man will come," because it will spell disaster for those it finds secure as they are now – secure for the wrong reasons, i mean, secure in the pleasures of this world, when they ought to be secure only when they have "dominated this world's lusts". the apostle certainly prepares us for that future life in words of which i also reminded you on that occasion.
again, in his "exposition of psalm 85", augustine is perhaps even more specific:
let us not expect security while we are on pilgrimage. when we do find ourselves wanting it, what we are looking for is bodily sluggishness rather than personal security.
catholics would also look to the passage in romans 8:13 for evidence that justification by faith is only valid so long as it is combined with obedient cooperation with the holy spirit, and the passage in romans 11:22 to show that the christian can lose their justification if they turn away from cooperating with the holy spirit and reject christ through mortal sin.
in the protestant interpretation, the new testament epistles (including romans), describes salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions. for example, romans (underlining added):
they also point out that in romans , paul says that god will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that "no one" follows the law perfectly (see also sermon on the mount: interpretation) romans :
martin luther described paul's letter to the romans as "the most important piece in the new testament. it is purest gospel. it is well worth a christian's while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul".
luther controversially added the word "alone" ("allein" in german) to romans so that it read: "thus, we hold, then, that man is justified without doing the works of the law, "alone" through faith". the word "alone" does not appear in the original greek text, but luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb "alone" was required both by idiomatic german and paul's intended meaning. this is a ""literalist view"" rather than a literal view of the bible.
apologist james swan lists numerous catholic sources that also translated romans 3:28 with the word "alone," or testified to others doing so before luther. a bible commentary published in 1864 reports that:
the "romans road" (or "roman road") refers to a set of scriptures from romans that christian evangelists use to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation to each person, as all the verses are contained in one single book, making it easier for evangelism without going back and forth through the entire new testament. the core verses used by nearly all groups using "romans road" are: romans , , , , and .
romans has been at the forefront of several major movements in protestantism. martin luther's lectures on romans in 1515–1516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of roman catholicism which led to the 95 theses of 1517. in 1738, while hearing luther's preface to the epistle to the romans read at st. botolph church on aldersgate street in london, john wesley famously felt his heart "strangely warmed", a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of methodism. in 1919 karl barth's commentary on romans, "the epistle to the romans", was the publication which is widely seen as the beginning of neo-orthodoxy.

eleanor of aquitaine (1122 or 1124 – 1 april 1204) was queen consort of france (1137–1152) and england (1154–1189) and duchess of aquitaine in her own right (1137–1204). as a member of the ramnulfids (house of poitiers) rulers in southwestern france, she was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western europe during the high middle ages. she was patron of literary figures such as wace, benoît de sainte-maure, and bernart de ventadorn. she led armies several times in her life and was a leader of the second crusade.
as duchess of aquitaine, eleanor was the most eligible bride in europe. three months after becoming duchess upon the death of her father, william x, she married king louis vii of france, son of her guardian, king louis vi. as queen of france, she participated in the unsuccessful second crusade. soon afterwards, eleanor sought an annulment of her marriage, but her request was rejected by pope eugene iii. however, after the birth of her second daughter alix, louis agreed to an annulment, as 15 years of marriage had not produced a son. the marriage was annulled on 21 march 1152 on the grounds of consanguinity within the fourth degree. their daughters were declared legitimate, custody was awarded to louis, and eleanor's lands were restored to her.
as soon as the annulment was granted, eleanor became engaged to the duke of normandy, who became king henry ii of england in 1154. henry was her third cousin and 11 years younger. the couple married on whitsun, 18 may 1152, eight weeks after the annulment of eleanor's first marriage, in poitiers cathedral. over the next 13 years, she bore eight children: five sons, three of whom became kings; and three daughters. however, henry and eleanor eventually became estranged. henry imprisoned her in 1173 for supporting their son henry's revolt against him. she was not released until 6 july 1189, when henry died and their second son, richard the lionheart, ascended the throne.
as queen dowager, eleanor acted as regent while richard went on the third crusade; on his return, richard was captured and held prisoner. eleanor lived well into the reign of her youngest son, john.
eleanor's year of birth is not known precisely: a late 13th-century genealogy of her family listing her as 13 years old in the spring of 1137 provides the best evidence that eleanor was perhaps born as late as 1124. on the other hand, some chronicles mention a fidelity oath of some lords of aquitaine on the occasion of eleanor's fourteenth birthday in 1136. this, and her known age of 82 at her death make 1122 more likely the year of birth. her parents almost certainly married in 1121. her birthplace may have been poitiers, bordeaux, or nieul-sur-l'autise, where her mother and brother died when eleanor was 6 or 8.
eleanor (or aliénor) was the oldest of three children of william x, duke of aquitaine, whose glittering ducal court was renowned in early 12th-century europe, and his wife, aenor de châtellerault, the daughter of aimery i, viscount of châtellerault, and dangereuse de l'isle bouchard, who was william ix's longtime mistress as well as eleanor's maternal grandmother. her parents' marriage had been arranged by dangereuse with her paternal grandfather williamix.
eleanor is said to have been named for her mother aenor and called "aliénor" from the latin "alia aenor", which means "the other aenor". it became "eléanor" in the "langues d'oïl" of northern france and "eleanor" in english. there was, however, another prominent eleanor before her—eleanor of normandy, an aunt of william the conqueror, who lived a century earlier than eleanor of aquitaine. in paris as the queen of france she was called helienordis, her honorific name as written in the latin epistles.
by all accounts, eleanor's father ensured that she had the best possible education. eleanor came to learn arithmetic, the constellations, and history. she also learned domestic skills such as household management and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving. eleanor developed skills in conversation, dancing, games such as backgammon, checkers, and chess, playing the harp, and singing. although her native tongue was poitevin, she was taught to read and speak latin, was well versed in music and literature, and schooled in riding, hawking, and hunting. eleanor was extroverted, lively, intelligent, and strong-willed. her four-year-old brother william aigret and their mother died at the castle of talmont on aquitaine's atlantic coast in the spring of 1130. eleanor became the heir presumptive to her father's domains. the duchy of aquitaine was the largest and richest province of france. poitou, where eleanor spent most of her childhood, and aquitaine together were almost one-third the size of modern france. eleanor had only one other legitimate sibling, a younger sister named aelith, also called petronilla. her half-brother joscelin was acknowledged by williamx as a son, but not as his heir. the notion that she had another half-brother, william, has been discredited. later, during the first four years of henryii's reign, her siblings joined eleanor's royal household.
in 1137 duke william x left poitiers for bordeaux and took his daughters with him. upon reaching bordeaux, he left them in the charge of the archbishop of bordeaux, one of his few loyal vassals. the duke then set out for the shrine of saint james of compostela in the company of other pilgrims. however, he died on good friday of that year (9april).
eleanor, aged 12 to 15, then became the duchess of aquitaine, and thus the most eligible heiress in europe. as these were the days when kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for obtaining a title, william dictated a will on the very day he died that bequeathed his domains to eleanor and appointed king louis vi of france as her guardian. william requested of the king that he take care of both the lands and the duchess, and find her a suitable husband. however, until a husband was found, the king had the legal right to eleanor's lands. the duke also insisted to his companions that his death be kept a secret until louis was informed; the men were to journey from saint james of compostela across the pyrenees as quickly as possible to call at bordeaux to notify the archbishop, then to make all speed to paris to inform the king.
the king of france, known as louis the fat, was also gravely ill at that time, suffering from a bout of dysentery from which he appeared unlikely to recover. yet despite his impending death, louis's mind remained clear. his heir, prince louis, had originally been destined for the monastic life of a younger son, but had become the heir apparent when his elder brother philip died from a riding accident in 1131.
the death of william, one of the king's most powerful vassals, made available the most desirable duchy in france. while presenting a solemn and dignified face to the grieving aquitainian messengers, louis exulted when they departed. rather than act as guardian to the duchess and duchy, he decided to marry the duchess to his 17-year-old heir and bring aquitaine under the control of the french crown, thereby greatly increasing the power and prominence of france and its ruling family, the house of capet. within hours, the king had arranged for prince louis to be married to eleanor, with abbot suger in charge of the wedding arrangements. prince louis was sent to bordeaux with an escort of 500 knights, along with abbot suger, theobald ii, count of champagne, and count ralph.
on 25 july 1137, eleanor and louis were married in the cathedral of saint-andré in bordeaux by the archbishop of bordeaux. immediately after the wedding, the couple were enthroned as duke and duchess of aquitaine. however, there was a catch: the land would remain independent of france until eleanor's oldest son became both king of france and duke of aquitaine. thus, her holdings would not be merged with france until the next generation. as a wedding present she gave louis a rock crystal vase , currently on display at the louvre. louis gave the vase to the basilica of st denis. this vase is the only object connected with eleanor of aquitaine that still survives.
louis's tenure as count of poitou and duke of aquitaine and gascony lasted only a few days. although he had been invested as such on 8 august 1137, a messenger gave him the news that louis vi had died of dysentery on 1 august while he and eleanor were making a tour of the provinces. he and eleanor were anointed and crowned king and queen of france on christmas day of the same year.
possessing a high-spirited nature, eleanor was not popular with the staid northerners; according to sources, louis's mother adelaide of maurienne thought her flighty and a bad influence. she was not aided by memories of constance of arles, the provençal wife of robert ii, tales of whose immodest dress and language were still told with horror. eleanor's conduct was repeatedly criticized by church elders, particularly bernard of clairvaux and abbot suger, as indecorous. the king was madly in love with his beautiful and worldly bride, however, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him. much money went into making the austere cité palace in paris more comfortable for eleanor's sake.
although louis was a pious man, he soon came into a violent conflict with pope innocent ii. in 1141, the archbishopric of bourges became vacant, and the king put forward as a candidate one of his chancellors, cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate, pierre de la chatre, who was promptly elected by the canons of bourges and consecrated by the pope. louis accordingly bolted the gates of bourges against the new bishop. the pope, recalling similar attempts by william x to exile supporters of innocent from poitou and replace them with priests loyal to himself, blamed eleanor, saying that louis was only a child and should be taught manners. outraged, louis swore upon relics that so long as he lived pierre should never enter bourges. an interdict was thereupon imposed upon the king's lands, and pierre was given refuge by theobald ii, count of champagne.
louis became involved in a war with count theobald by permitting raoul i, count of vermandois and seneschal of france, to repudiate his wife eléonore of blois, theobald's sister, and to marry petronilla of aquitaine, eleanor's sister. eleanor urged louis to support her sister's marriage to count raoul. theobald had also offended louis by siding with the pope in the dispute over bourges. the war lasted two years (1142–44) and ended with the occupation of champagne by the royal army. louis was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of vitry. more than a thousand people who sought refuge in the church there died in the flames. horrified, and desiring an end to the war, louis attempted to make peace with theobald in exchange for his support in lifting the interdict on raoul and petronilla. this was duly lifted for long enough to allow theobald's lands to be restored; it was then lowered once more when raoul refused to repudiate petronilla, prompting louis to return to champagne and ravage it once more.
in june 1144, the king and queen visited the newly built monastic church at saint-denis. while there, the queen met with bernard of clairvaux, demanding that he use his influence with the pope to have the excommunication of petronilla and raoul lifted, in exchange for which king louis would make concessions in champagne and recognise pierre de la chatre as archbishop of bourges. dismayed at her attitude, bernard scolded eleanor for her lack of penitence and interference in matters of state. in response, eleanor broke down and meekly excused her behaviour, claiming to be bitter because of her lack of children. in response, bernard became more kindly towards her: "my child, seek those things which make for peace. cease to stir up the king against the church, and urge upon him a better course of action. if you will promise to do this, i in return promise to entreat the merciful lord to grant you offspring." in a matter of weeks, peace had returned to france: theobald's provinces were returned and pierre de la chatre was installed as archbishop of bourges. in april 1145, eleanor gave birth to a daughter, marie.
louis, however, still burned with guilt over the massacre at vitry and wished to make a pilgrimage to the holy land to atone for his sins. in autumn 1145, pope eugene iii requested that louis lead a crusade to the middle east to rescue the frankish kingdoms there from disaster. accordingly, louis declared on christmas day 1145 at bourges his intention of going on a crusade.
eleanor of aquitaine also formally took up the cross symbolic of the second crusade during a sermon preached by bernard of clairvaux. in addition, she had been corresponding with her uncle raymond, prince of the crusader kingdom of antioch, who was seeking further protection from the french crown against the saracens. eleanor recruited some of her royal ladies-in-waiting for the campaign as well as 300 non-noble aquitainian vassals. she insisted on taking part in the crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. the story that she and her ladies dressed as amazons is disputed by historians, sometimes confused with the account of king conrad's train of ladies during this campaign in edward gibbon's "the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire". she left for the second crusade from vézelay, the rumored location of mary magdalene's grave in june 1147.
the crusade itself achieved little. louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. in eastern europe, the french army was at times hindered by manuel i comnenus, the byzantine emperor, who feared that the crusade would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at constantinople, louis was fêted and eleanor was much admired. she was compared with penthesilea, mythical queen of the amazons, by the greek historian nicetas choniates. he added that she gained the epithet "chrysopous" (golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. louis and eleanor stayed in the philopation palace just outside the city walls.
from the moment the crusaders entered asia minor, things began to go badly. the king and queen were still optimistic —the byzantine emperor had told them that the german king conrad had won a great victory against a turkish army when in fact the german army had been massacred. however, while camping near nicea, the remnants of the german army, including a dazed and sick king conrad, staggered past the french camp, bringing news of their disaster. the french, with what remained of the germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards antioch. they were in high spirits on christmas eve, when they chose to camp in a lush valley near ephesus. here they were ambushed by a turkish detachment, but the french proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.
louis then decided to cross the phrygian mountains directly in the hope of reaching eleanor's uncle raymond in antioch more quickly. as they ascended the mountains, however, the army and the king and queen were horrified to discover the unburied corpses of the german army previously slaughtered there.
on the day set for the crossing of mount cadmus, louis chose to take charge of the rear of the column, where the unarmed pilgrims and the baggage trains marched. the vanguard, with which queen eleanor marched, was commanded by her aquitainian vassal, geoffrey de rancon. unencumbered by baggage, they reached the summit of cadmus, where rancon had been ordered to make camp for the night. rancon, however, chose to continue on, deciding in concert with amadeus iii, count of savoy, louis's uncle, that a nearby plateau would make a better campsite. such disobedience was reportedly common.
accordingly, by mid-afternoon, the rear of the column —believing the day's march to be nearly at an end —was dawdling. this resulted in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching it. at this point the turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. the french, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. those who tried to escape were caught and killed. many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. the chronicler william of tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.
the king, having scorned royal apparel in favour of a simple pilgrim's tunic, escaped notice, unlike his bodyguards, whose skulls were brutally smashed and limbs severed. he reportedly "nimbly and bravely scaled a rock by making use of some tree roots which god had provided for his safety" and managed to survive the attack. others were not so fortunate: "no aid came from heaven, except that night fell."
official blame for the disaster was placed on geoffrey de rancon, who had made the decision to continue, and it was suggested that he be hanged, a suggestion which the king ignored. since geoffrey was eleanor's vassal, many believed that it was she who had been ultimately responsible for the change in plan, and thus the massacre. this suspicion of responsibility did nothing for her popularity in christendom. she was also blamed for the size of the baggage train and the fact that her aquitainian soldiers had marched at the front and thus were not involved in the fight. continuing on, the army became split, with the commoners marching toward antioch and the royalty traveling by sea. when most of the land army arrived, the king and queen had a dispute. some, such as john of salisbury and william of tyre, say eleanor's reputation was sullied by rumours of an affair with her uncle raymond. however, this rumor may have been a ruse, as raymond, through eleanor, had been trying to induce louis to use his army to attack the actual muslim encampment at nearby aleppo, gateway to retaking edessa, which had all along, by papal decree, been the main objective of the crusade. although this was perhaps the better military plan, louis was not keen to fight in northern syria. one of louis's avowed crusade goals was to journey in pilgrimage to jerusalem, and he stated his intention to continue. reputedly eleanor then requested to stay with raymond and brought up the matter of consanguinity —the fact that she and her husband, king louis, were perhaps too closely related. consanguinity was grounds for annulment in the medieval period. but rather than allowing her to stay, louis took eleanor from antioch against her will and continued on to jerusalem with his dwindling army.
louis's refusal and his forcing her to accompany him humiliated eleanor, and she maintained a low profile for the rest of the crusade. louis's subsequent assault on damascus in 1148 with his remaining army, fortified by king conrad and baldwin iii of jerusalem, achieved little. damascus was a major wealthy trading centre and was under normal circumstances a potential threat, but the rulers of jerusalem had recently entered into a truce with the city, which they then forswore. it was a gamble that did not pay off, and whether through military error or betrayal, the damascus campaign was a failure. louis's long march to jerusalem and back north, which eleanor was forced to join, debilitated his army and disheartened her knights; the divided crusade armies could not overcome the muslim forces, and the royal couple had to return home. the french royal family retreated to jerusalem and then sailed to rome and made their way back to paris.
while in the eastern mediterranean, eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there, which were the beginnings of what would become admiralty law. she introduced those conventions in her own lands on the island of oleron in 1160 (with the "rolls of oléron") and later in england as well. she was also instrumental in developing trade agreements with constantinople and ports of trade in the holy lands.
even before the crusade, eleanor and louis were becoming estranged, and their differences were only exacerbated while they were abroad. eleanor's purported relationship with her uncle raymond, the ruler of antioch, was a major source of discord. eleanor supported her uncle's desire to re-capture the nearby county of edessa, the objective of the crusade. in addition, having been close to him in their youth, she now showed what was considered to be "excessive affection" toward her uncle. raymond had plans to abduct eleanor, to which she consented. while many historians today dismiss this as normal affection between uncle and niece, noting their early friendship and his similarity to her father and grandfather, some of eleanor's adversaries interpreted the generous displays of affection as an incestuous affair.
home, however, was not easily reached. louis and eleanor, on separate ships due to their disagreements, were first attacked in may 1149 by byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the byzantine emperor. although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove eleanor's ship far to the south to the barbary coast and caused her to lose track of her husband. neither was heard of for over two months. in mid-july, eleanor's ship finally reached palermo in sicily, where she discovered that she and her husband had both been given up for dead. she was given shelter and food by servants of king roger ii of sicily, until the king eventually reached calabria, and she set out to meet him there. later, at king roger's court in potenza, she learned of the death of her uncle raymond, who had been beheaded by muslim forces in the holy land. this news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to france from marseilles, they went to see pope eugene iii in tusculum, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the commune of rome.
eugene did not, as eleanor had hoped, grant an annulment. instead, he attempted to reconcile eleanor and louis, confirming the legality of their marriage. he proclaimed that no word could be spoken against it, and that it might not be dissolved under any pretext. eventually, he arranged events so that eleanor had no choice but to sleep with louis in a bed specially prepared by the pope. thus was conceived their second child —not a son, but another daughter, alix of france.
the marriage was now doomed. still without a son and in danger of being left with no male heir, facing substantial opposition to eleanor from many of his barons and her own desire for annulment, louis bowed to the inevitable. on 11 march 1152, they met at the royal castle of beaugency to dissolve the marriage. hugues de toucy, archbishop of sens, presided, and louis and eleanor were both present, as were the archbishop of bordeaux and rouen. archbishop samson of reims acted for eleanor.
on 21 march, the four archbishops, with the approval of pope eugene, granted an annulment on grounds of consanguinity within the fourth degree; eleanor was louis' third cousin once removed, and shared common ancestry with robert ii of france. their two daughters were, however, declared legitimate. children born to a marriage that was later annulled were not at risk of being "bastardized," because "[w]here parties married in good faith, without knowledge of an impediment, ... children of the marriage were legitimate." [berman 228.] ) custody of them was awarded to king louis. archbishop samson received assurances from louis that eleanor's lands would be restored to her.
as eleanor traveled to poitiers, two lords —theobald v, count of blois, and geoffrey, count of nantes, brother of henry ii, duke of normandy —tried to kidnap and marry her to claim her lands. as soon as she arrived in poitiers, eleanor sent envoys to henry, duke of normandy and future king of england, asking him to come at once to marry her. on 18 may 1152 (whit sunday), eight weeks after her annulment, eleanor married henry "without the pomp and ceremony that befitted their rank."
eleanor was related to henry even more closely than she had been to louis: they were cousins to the third degree through their common ancestor ermengarde of anjou, wife of robert i, duke of burgundy and geoffrey, count of gâtinais, and they were also descended from king robert ii of france. a marriage between henry and eleanor's daughter marie had earlier been declared impossible due to their status as third cousins once removed. it was rumored by some that eleanor had had an affair with henry's own father, geoffrey v, count of anjou, who had advised his son to avoid any involvement with her.
on 25 october 1154, henry became king of england. eleanor was crowned queen of england by the archbishop of canterbury on 19 december 1154. she may not have been anointed on this occasion, however, because she had already been anointed in 1137. over the next 13 years, she bore henry five sons and three daughters: william, henry, richard, geoffrey, john, matilda, eleanor, and joan. john speed, in his 1611 work "history of great britain", mentions the possibility that eleanor had a son named philip, who died young. his sources no longer exist, and he alone mentions this birth.
eleanor's marriage to henry was reputed to be tumultuous and argumentative, although sufficiently cooperative to produce at least eight pregnancies. henry was by no means faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering. henry fathered other, illegitimate children throughout the marriage. eleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. geoffrey of york, for example, was an illegitimate son of henry, but acknowledged by henry as his child and raised at westminster in the care of the queen.
during the period from henry's accession to the birth of eleanor's youngest son john, affairs in the kingdom were turbulent: aquitaine, as was the norm, defied the authority of henry as eleanor's husband and answered only to their duchess. attempts were made to claim toulouse, the rightful inheritance of eleanor's grandmother philippa of toulouse, but they ended in failure. a bitter feud arose between the king and thomas becket, initially his chancellor and closest adviser and later the archbishop of canterbury. louis of france had remarried and been widowed; he married for the third time and finally fathered a long-hoped-for son, philip augustus, also known as dieudonne—god-given). "young henry," son of henry and eleanor, wed margaret, daughter of louis from his second marriage. little is known of eleanor's involvement in these events. it is certain that by late 1166, henry's notorious affair with rosamund clifford had become known, and eleanor's marriage to henry appears to have become terminally strained.
in 1167, eleanor's third daughter, matilda, married henry the lion of saxony. eleanor remained in england with her daughter for the year prior to matilda's departure for normandy in september. in december, eleanor gathered her movable possessions in england and transported them on several ships to argentan. christmas was celebrated at the royal court there, and she appears to have agreed to a separation from henry. she certainly left for her own city of poitiers immediately after christmas. henry did not stop her; on the contrary, he and his army personally escorted her there before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious lusignan family. henry then went about his own business outside aquitaine, leaving earl patrick, his regional military commander, as her protective custodian. when patrick was killed in a skirmish, eleanor, who proceeded to ransom his captured nephew, the young william marshal, was left in control of her lands.
of all her influence on culture, eleanor's time in poitiers between 1168 and 1173 was perhaps the most critical, yet very little is known about it. henry ii was elsewhere, attending to his own affairs after escorting eleanor there. some believe that eleanor's court in poitiers was the "court of love" where eleanor and her daughter marie meshed and encouraged the ideas of troubadours, chivalry, and courtly love into a single court. it may have been largely to teach manners, something the french courts would be known for in later generations. yet the existence and reasons for this court are debated.
in "the art of courtly love", andreas capellanus, andrew the chaplain, refers to the court of poitiers. he claims that eleanor, her daughter marie, ermengarde, viscountess of narbonne, and isabelle of flanders would sit and listen to the quarrels of lovers and act as a jury to the questions of the court that revolved around acts of romantic love. he records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true love can exist in marriage. according to capellanus, the women decided that it was not at all likely.
some scholars believe that the "court of love" probably never existed since the only evidence for it is andreas capellanus' book. to strengthen their argument, they state that there is no other evidence that marie ever stayed with her mother in poitiers. andreas wrote for the court of the king of france, where eleanor was not held in esteem. polly schoyer brooks, the author of a non-academic biography of eleanor, suggests that the court did exist, but that it was not taken very seriously, and that acts of courtly love were just a "parlor game" made up by eleanor and marie in order to place some order over the young courtiers living there.
there is no claim that eleanor invented courtly love, for it was a concept that had begun to grow before eleanor's court arose. all that can be said is that her court at poitiers was most likely a catalyst for the increased popularity of courtly love literature in the western european regions. amy kelly, in her article, "eleanor of aquitaine and her courts of love," gives a very plausible description of the origins of the rules of eleanor's court: "in the poitevin code, man is the property, the very thing of woman; whereas a precisely contrary state of things existed in the adjacent realms of the two kings from whom the reigning duchess of aquitaine was estranged."
in march 1173, aggrieved at his lack of power and egged on by henry's enemies, his son by the same name, the younger henry, launched the revolt of 1173–1174. he fled to paris. from there, "the younger henry, devising evil against his father from every side by the advice of the french king, went secretly into aquitaine where his two youthful brothers, richard and geoffrey, were living with their mother, and with her connivance, so it is said, he incited them to join him."one source claimed that the queen sent her younger sons to france "to join with him against their father the king." once her sons had left for paris, eleanor may have encouraged the lords of the south to rise up and support them.
sometime between the end of march and the beginning of may, eleanor left poitiers, but was arrested and sent to the king at rouen. the king did not announce the arrest publicly; for the next year, the queen's whereabouts were unknown. on 8 july 1174, henry and eleanor took ship for england from barfleur. as soon as they disembarked at southampton, eleanor was taken either to winchester castle or sarum castle and held there.
eleanor was imprisoned for the next 16 years, much of the time in various locations in england. during her imprisonment, eleanor became more and more distant from her sons, especially from richard, who had always been her favorite. she did not have the opportunity to see her sons very often during her imprisonment, though she was released for special occasions such as christmas. about four miles from shrewsbury and close by haughmond abbey is "queen eleanor's bower," the remains of a triangular castle which is believed to have been one of her prisons.
henry lost the woman reputed to be his great love, rosamund clifford, in 1176. he had met her in 1166 and had begun their liaison in 1173, supposedly contemplating divorce from eleanor. this notorious affair caused a monkish scribe to transcribe rosamund's name in latin to "rosa immundi", or "rose of unchastity". the king had many mistresses, but although he treated earlier liaisons discreetly, he flaunted rosamund. he may have done so to provoke eleanor into seeking an annulment, but if so, the queen disappointed him. nevertheless, rumours persisted, perhaps assisted by henry's camp, that eleanor had poisoned rosamund. it is also speculated that eleanor placed rosamund in a bathtub and had an old woman cut rosamund's arms. henry donated much money to godstow nunnery, where rosamund was buried.
in 1183, the young king henry tried again to force his father to hand over some of his patrimony. in debt and refused control of normandy, he tried to ambush his father at limoges. he was joined by troops sent by his brother geoffrey and philip ii of france. henry ii's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. after wandering aimlessly through aquitaine, henry the younger caught dysentery. on saturday, 11 june 1183, the young king realized he was dying and was overcome with remorse for his sins. when his father's ring was sent to him, he begged that his father would show mercy to his mother, and that all his companions would plead with henry to set her free. henry ii sent thomas of earley, archdeacon of wells, to break the news to eleanor at sarum. eleanor reputedly had a dream in which she foresaw her son henry's death. in 1193, she would tell pope celestine iii that she was tortured by his memory.
king philip ii of france claimed that certain properties in normandy belonged to his half-sister margaret, widow of the young henry, but henry insisted that they had once belonged to eleanor and would revert to her upon her son's death. for this reason henry summoned eleanor to normandy in the late summer of 1183. she stayed in normandy for six months. this was the beginning of a period of greater freedom for the still-supervised eleanor. eleanor went back to england probably early in 1184. over the next few years eleanor often travelled with her husband and was sometimes associated with him in the government of the realm, but still had a custodian so that she was not free.
upon the death of her husband henry ii on 6 july 1189, richard i was the undisputed heir. one of his first acts as king was to send william marshal to england with orders to release eleanor from prison; he found upon his arrival that her custodians had already released her. eleanor rode to westminster and received the oaths of fealty from many lords and prelates on behalf of the king. she ruled england in richard's name, signing herself "eleanor, by the grace of god, queen of england." on 13august 1189, richard sailed from barfleur to portsmouth and was received with enthusiasm. between 1190 and 1194, richard was absent from england, engaged in the third crusade from 1190 to 1192 and then held in captivity by henryvi, holy roman emperor. during richard's absence, royal authority in england was represented by a council of regency in conjunction with a succession of chief justiciarswilliam de longchamp (1190–1191), walter decoutances (1191–1193), and finally hubert walter. although eleanor held no formal office in england during this period, she arrived in england in the company of coutances in june 1191, and for the remainder of richard's absence, she exercised a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of england as well as the conduct of prince john. eleanor played a key role in raising the ransom demanded from england by henryvi and in the negotiations with the holy roman emperor that eventually secured richard's release.
eleanor survived richard and lived well into the reign of her youngest son, king john. in 1199, under the terms of a truce between king philipii and king john, it was agreed that philip's 12-year-old heir-apparent louis would be married to one of john's nieces, daughters of his sister eleanor of england, queen of castile. john instructed his mother to travel to castile to select one of the princesses. now 77, eleanor set out from poitiers. just outside poitiers she was ambushed and held captive by hugh ix of lusignan, whose lands had been sold to henryii by his forebears. eleanor secured her freedom by agreeing to his demands. she continued south, crossed the pyrenees, and travelled through the kingdoms of navarre and castile, arriving in castile before the end of january 1200.
king alfonso viii and eleanor's daughter, queen eleanor of castile, had two remaining unmarried daughters, urraca and blanche. eleanor selected the younger daughter, blanche. she stayed for two months at the castilian court, then late in march journeyed with granddaughter blanche back across the pyrenees. she celebrated easter in bordeaux, where the famous warrior mercadier came to her court. it was decided that he would escort the queen and princess north. "on the second day in easter week, he was slain in the city by a man-at-arms in the service of brandin," a rival mercenary captain. this tragedy was too much for the elderly queen, who was fatigued and unable to continue to normandy. she and blanche rode in easy stages to the valley of the loire, and she entrusted blanche to the archbishop of bordeaux, who took over as her escort. the exhausted eleanor went to fontevraud, where she remained. in early summer, eleanor was ill, and john visited her at fontevraud.
eleanor was again unwell in early 1201. when war broke out between john and philip, eleanor declared her support for john and set out from fontevraud to her capital poitiers to prevent her grandson arthur i, duke of brittany, posthumous son of eleanor's son geoffrey and john's rival for the english throne, from taking control. arthur learned of her whereabouts and besieged her in the castle of mirebeau. as soon as john heard of this, he marched south, overcame the besiegers, and captured the 15-year-old arthur, and probably his sister eleanor, fair maid of brittany, whom eleanor had raised with richard. eleanor then returned to fontevraud where she took the veil as a nun.
eleanor died in 1204 and was entombed in fontevraud abbey next to her husband henry and her son richard. her tomb effigy shows her reading a bible and is decorated with magnificent jewelry. by the time of her death she had outlived all of her children except for king john of england and queen eleanor of castile.
contemporary sources praise eleanor's beauty. even in an era when ladies of the nobility were excessively praised, their praise of her was undoubtedly sincere. when she was young, she was described as "perpulchra"more than beautiful. when she was around 30, bernard de ventadour, a noted troubadour, called her "gracious, lovely, the embodiment of charm," extolling her "lovely eyes and noble countenance" and declaring that she was "one meet to crown the state of any king." william of newburgh emphasized the charms of her person, and even in her old age richard of devizes described her as beautiful, while matthew paris, writing in the 13thcentury, recalled her "admirable beauty."
in spite of all these words of praise, no one left a more detailed description of eleanor; the colour of her hair and eyes, for example, are unknown. the effigy on her tomb shows a tall and large-boned woman with brown skin, though this may not be an accurate representation. her seal of 1152 shows a woman with a slender figure, but this is likely an impersonal image.
judy chicago's artistic installation "the dinner party" features a place setting for eleanor.
henry and eleanor are the main characters in james goldman's play "the lion in winter", which was made into a film in 1968 starring peter o'toole as henry and katharine hepburn in the role of eleanor, for which she won the academy award for best actress and the bafta award for best actress in a leading role and was nominated for the golden globe award for best actress—motion picture drama.
jean plaidy's novel 'the courts of love', fifth in the 'queens of england' series, is a fictionalised autobiography of eleanor of aquitaine.
the character queen elinor appears in william shakespeare's "king john", with other members of the family. on television, she has been portrayed in this play by una venning in the "bbc sunday night theatre" version (1952) and by mary morris in the bbc shakespeare version (1984).
in sharon kay penman's plantagenet novels, she figures prominently in "when christ and his saints slept", "time and chance", and "devil's brood", and also appears in "lionheart" and "a king's ransom", both of which focus on the reign of her son, richard, as king of england. eleanor also appears briefly in the first novel of penman’s welsh trilogy, "here be dragons". in penman's historical mysteries, eleanor, as richard’s regent, sends squire justin de quincy on various missions, often an investigation of a situation involving prince john. the four published mysteries are the "queen's man", "cruel as the grave", "dragon's lair", and "prince of darkness".
eleanor is the subject of "a proud taste for scarlet and miniver", a children's novel by e.l. konigsburg.
historical fiction author elizabeth chadwick wrote a three-volume series about eleanor: "the summer queen" (2013), "the winter crown" (2014) and "the autumn throne" (2016).
eleanor has featured in a number of screen versions of the "ivanhoe" and "robin hood" stories. she has been played by martita hunt in "the story of robin hood and his merrie men" (1952), jill esmond in the british tv adventure series "the adventures of robin hood" (1955–1960), phyllis neilson-terry in the british tv adventure series "ivanhoe" (1958), yvonne mitchell in the bbc tv drama series "the legend of robin hood" (1975), siân phillips in the tv series "ivanhoe" (1997), and tusse silberg in the tv series "the new adventures of robin hood" (1997). she was portrayed by lynda bellingham in the bbc series "robin hood". most recently, she was portrayed by eileen atkins in "robin hood" (2010).
in the 1964 film "becket", eleanor is briefly played by pamela brown to peter o'toole's first performance as a young henry ii.
in the 1968 film "the lion in winter", eleanor is played by katharine hepburn, who won the third of her four academy awards for best actress for her portrayal, and henry again is portrayed by o'toole. the film is about the difficult relationship between them and the struggle of their three sons richard, geoffrey, and john for their father's favour and the succession. in the 2003 television film "the lion in winter", eleanor was played by glenn close alongside patrick stewart as henry.
she was portrayed by mary clare in the silent film "becket" (1923), by prudence hyman in "richard the lionheart" (1962), and twice by jane lapotaire in the bbc tv drama series "the devil's crown" (1978) and again in mike walker's bbc radio 4 series "plantagenet" (2010). in the 2010 film "robin hood", starring russell crowe, eleanor is played by eileen atkins. in the 2014 film "", eleanor is played by debbie rochon.

the epistle of paul to philemon, known simply as philemon, is one of the books of the christian new testament. it is a prison letter, co-authored by paul the apostle with timothy, to philemon, a leader in the colossian church. it deals with the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation. paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as "a prisoner of jesus christ", calling timothy "our brother", and addressing philemon as "fellow labourer" and "brother." onesimus, a slave that had departed from his master philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein paul asked philemon to receive him as a "brother beloved."
philemon was a wealthy christian, possibly a bishop of the house church that met in his home () in colosse. this letter is now generally regarded as one of the undisputed works of paul. it is the shortest of paul's extant letters, consisting of only 335 words in the greek text.
the epistle of philemon is attributed to the apostle paul, and this attribution has rarely been questioned by scholars. along with six others, it is numbered among the "undisputed letters", which are widely considered to be authentically pauline. the main challenge to the letter's authenticity came from a group of german scholars in the nineteenth century known as the tübingen school. their leader, ferdinand christian baur, only accepted four new testament epistles as genuinely written by paul: romans, 1 and 2 corinthians and galatians. commenting on philemon, baur described the subject matter as "so very singular as to arouse our suspicions," and concluded that it is perhaps a "christian romance serving to convey a genuine christian idea."
the opening verse of the salutation also names timothy alongside paul. this, however, does not mean that timothy was the epistle's co-author. rather, paul regularly mentions others in the address if they have a particular connection with the recipient. in this case, timothy may have encountered philemon while accompanying paul in his work in ephesus.
according to the majority interpretation, paul wrote this letter on behalf of onesimus, a runaway slave who had wronged his owner philemon. the details of the offence are unstated, although it is often assumed that onesimus had fled after stealing money, as paul states in verse 18 that if onesimus owes anything, philemon should charge this to paul's account. sometime after leaving, onesimus came into contact with paul, although again the details are unclear. he may have been arrested and imprisoned alongside paul. alternatively, he may have previously heard paul's name (as his owner was a christian) and so travelled to him for help. after meeting paul, onesimus became a christian believer. an affection grew between them, and paul would have been glad to keep onesimus with him. however, he considered it better to send him back to philemon with an accompanying letter, which aimed to effect reconciliation between them as christian brothers. the preservation of the letter suggests that paul's request was granted.
onesimus' status as a runaway slave was challenged by allen dwight callahan in an article published in the "harvard theological review" and in a later commentary. callahan argues that, beyond verse 16, "nothing in the text conclusively indicates that onesimus was ever the chattel of the letter's chief addressee. moreover, the expectations fostered by the traditional fugitive slave hypothesis go unrealized in the letter. modern commentators, even those committed to the prevailing interpretation, have tacitly admitted as much." callahan argues that the earliest commentators on this work – the homily of origen and the anti-marcion preface – are silent about onesimus' possible servile status, and traces the origins of this interpretation to john chrysostom, who proposed it in his "homiliae in epistolam ad philemonem", during his ministry in antioch, circa 386–398. in place of the traditional interpretation, callahan suggests that onesimus and philemon are brothers both by blood and religion, but who have become estranged, and the intent of this letter was to reconcile the two men. ben witherington iii has challenged callahan's interpretation as a misreading of paul's rhetoric. further, margaret m. mitchell has demonstrated that a number of writers before chrysostom either argue or assume that onesimus was a runaway slave, including athanasius, basil of caesarea and ambrosiaster.
the only extant information about onesimus apart from this letter is found in paul's epistle to the colossians 4:7–9, where onesimus is called "a faithful and beloved brother":
the letter is addressed to philemon, apphia and archippus, and the church in philemon's house. philemon is described as a "fellow worker" of paul. it is generally assumed that he lived in colossae; in the letter to the colossians, onesimus (the slave who fled from philemon) and archippus (whom paul greets in the letter to philemon) are described as members of the church there. philemon may have converted to christianity through paul's ministry, possibly in ephesus. apphia in the salutation is probably philemon's wife. some have speculated that archippus, described by paul as a "fellow soldier", is the son of philemon and apphia.
the american john knox proposed that onesimus' owner was in fact archippus, and the letter was addressed to him rather than philemon. in this reconstruction, philemon would receive the letter first and then encourage archippus to release onesimus so that he could work alongside paul. this view, however, has not found widespread support. in particular, knox's view has been challenged on the basis of the opening verses. according to o'brien, the fact that philemon's name is mentioned first, together with the use of the phrase "in your house" in verse 2, makes it unlikely that archippus was the primary addressee. knox further argued that the letter was intended to be read aloud in the colossian church in order to put pressure on archippus. a number of commentators, however, see this view as contradicting the tone of the letter. j. b. lightfoot, for example, wrote: "the tact and delicacy of the apostle's pleading for onesimus would be nullified at one stroke by the demand for publication."
the opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other pauline letters. paul first introduces himself, with a self-designation as a "prisoner of jesus christ," which in this case refers to a physical imprisonment. he also mentions his associate timothy, as a valued colleague who was presumably known to the recipient. as well as addressing the letter to philemon, paul sends greetings to apphia, archippus and the church that meets in philemon's house. apphia is often presumed to be philemon's wife and archippus, a "fellow labourer", is sometimes suggested to be their son. paul concludes his salutation with a prayerful wish for grace and peace.
before addressing the main topic of the letter, paul continues with a paragraph of thanksgiving and intercession. this serves to prepare the ground for paul's central request. he gives thanks to god for philemon's love and faith and prays for his faith to be effective. he concludes this paragraph by describing the joy and comfort he has received from knowing how philemon has shown love towards the christians in colossae.
as a background to his specific plea for onesimus, paul clarifies his intentions and circumstances. although he has the boldness to command philemon to do what would be right in the circumstances, he prefers to base his appeal on his knowledge of philemon's love and generosity. he also describes the affection he has for onesimus and the transformation that has taken place with onesimus's conversion to the christian faith. where onesimus was "useless", now he is "useful" – a wordplay, as onesimus means "useful". paul indicates that he would have been glad to keep onesimus with him, but recognised that it was right to send him back. paul's specific request is for philemon to welcome onesimus as he would welcome paul, namely as a christian brother. he offers to pay for any debt created by onesimus' departure and expresses his desire that philemon might refresh his heart in christ.
in the final section of the letter, paul describes his confidence that philemon would do even more than he had requested, perhaps indicating his desire for onesimus to return to work alongside him. he also mentions his wish to visit and asks philemon to prepare a guest room. paul sends greetings from five of his co-workers and concludes the letter with a benediction.
paul uses slavery vs. freedom language more often in his writings as a metaphor. at this time slavery was common, and can be seen as a theme in the book of philemon. slavery was most commonly found in households. this letter, seemingly, provided alleviation of suffering of some slaves due to the fact that paul placed pastoral focus on the issue.
although it is a main theme, paul does not label slavery as negative or positive. some scholars see it as unthinkable in the times to even question ending slavery. because slavery was so ingrained into society that the “abolitionist would have been at the same time an insurrectionist, and the political effects of such a movement would have been unthinkable. paul doesn’t question it in this epistle. paul may have envisioned slavery as a fixed institution. he was not questioning the “rightness or wrongness” of it. paul did however view slavery as a human institution, and believed that all human institutions were about to fade away. this may be because paul had the perspective that jesus would return soon. paul viewed his present world as something that was swiftly passing away. this is a part of pauline christianity and theology.
when it comes to onesimus and his circumstance as a slave, paul felt that onesimus should return to philemon but not as a slave, but under a bond of familial love. paul also was not suggesting that onesimus be punished, but roman law allowed the owner of a runaway slave nearly unlimited privileges of punishment, even execution. this is a concern of paul and a reason he is writing to philemon, asking that philemon accept onesimus back in a bond of friendship, forgiveness, and reconciliation. paul is trying to break through the social barriers dividing people. we see this in many of paul’s other epistles, including his letters to the corinthians, delivering the message of unity with others and unity with christ – a change of identity. as written in sacra pagina philippians and philemon, the move from slave to freedman has to do with a shift in “standing under the lordship of jesus christ”. so in short, onesimus’ honor and obedience is not claimed by philemon, but by christ.
verses 13–14 suggest that paul wants philemon to send onesimus back to paul (possibly freeing him for the purpose). marshall, travis and paul write, "paul hoped that it might be possible for [onesimus] to spend some time with him as a missionary colleague... if that is not a request for onesimus to join paul’s circle, i do not know what more would need to be said".
sarah ruden, in her "paul among the people" (2010), argues that in the letter to philemon, paul created the western conception of the individual human being, "unconditionally precious to god and therefore entitled to the consideration of other human beings." before paul, ruden argues, a slave was considered subhuman, and entitled to no more consideration than an animal.
diarmaid macculloch, in his "a history of christianity", described the epistle as "a christian foundation document in the justification of slavery".
in order to better appreciate the book of philemon, it is necessary to be aware the situation of the early christian community in the roman empire; and the economic system of classical antiquity based on slavery. according to the epistle to diognetus: "for the christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe... they are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. they pass their days on earth, but they are citizens of heaven. they obey the prescribed laws, and at the same time surpass the laws by their lives".
pope benedict xvi refers to this letter in the encyclic, "spe salvi", highlighting the power of christianity as power of the transformation of society. in fact christianity was decisive to the virtual disappearance of slavery during the middle ages:

fredericton (; ) is the capital of the canadian province of new brunswick. the city is situated in the west-central portion of the province along the saint john river, which flows west to east as it bisects the city. the river is the dominant natural feature of the area. one of the main urban centres in new brunswick, the city had a population of 56,224 in the 2011 census. it is the third-largest city in the province after moncton and saint john.
an important cultural, artistic, and educational centre for the province, fredericton is home to two universities, the new brunswick college of craft and design, and cultural institutions such as the beaverbrook art gallery, the fredericton region museum, and the playhouse, a performing arts venue. the city hosts the annual harvest jazz & blues festival, attracting regional and international jazz, blues, rock, and world artists. fredericton is also an important and vibrant centre point for the region's top visual artists; many of new brunswick's notable artists live and work there today. fredericton has also been home to some great historical canadian painters as well, including goodridge roberts, and molly and bruno bobak.
as a provincial capital, its economy is tied to the public sector; however, the city also contains a growing it and commercial sector. the city has the highest percentage of residents with a post-secondary education in the province and the highest per capita income of any city in new brunswick.
the earliest known inhabitation of the area dates back 12,000 years, according to archaeologists, evidenced by recent finds. excavations unearthed a campsite with firepit and more than 600 artifacts including stone tool fragments and arrowheads.
the area of the present-day city of fredericton was first used for seasonal farming by the maliseet peoples. maliseet cultivated food plants including: beans, pumpkins, jerusalem artichokes, ground nuts, and maize on the river banks and islands of the saint john river. in the mid-18th century their principal village of aucpaque was located several kilometres upriver from the site of present-day fredericton.
the first european contact was by the french in the late 17th century. joseph robineau de villebon received a land grant and was appointed governor of acadia. during king william's war, villebon built fort nashwaak on the north side of the saint john river, at the mouth of the nashwaak river. for most of the war, fort nashwaak served as the capital of the french colony of acadia; forces from here conducted numerous military raids on english settlers on the new england/ acadia border.
french and english hostilities continued along the border. within weeks of an attack of french and indigenous forces launched from fort nashwaak on pemaquid, maine (present day bristol, maine), the new englanders struck back. in 1696, an expedition under command of major benjamin church set out to destroy fort nashwaak (present-day fredericton). commander villebon had been alerted and prepared his defences. on 18 october, the british troops arrived near the fort, landed three cannons, and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the nashwaak river. the siege of fort nashwaak last for two days gunfire was fiercely exchanged, with the advantage going to the better-sited acadian guns. the new englanders were defeated, with 8 soldiers killed and 17 wounded. the acadians sustained losses of one killed and two wounded.
after villebon's death in 1700 and a devastating flood that destroyed several french farms in the area, the fort was abandoned. the fredericton area was first permanently settled and named pointe-sainte-anne (later often anglicized to "ste. anne's point") in 1732 by acadians fleeing nova scotia after the british took over the territory (1710). their townsite was on the south side of the river, approximately a mile upriver from fort nashwaak.
the british captured ste. anne's point during the expulsion of the acadians, burning the settlement to the ground in the st. john river campaign (1759) during the french and indian war, the north american front of their seven years' war in europe against france.
a 1762 settlement attempt by the british was unsuccessful due to the hostility of local acadian and aboriginal populations. these settlers eventually erected a community downriver at what is today the town of maugerville (pronounced "majorville"). however, three fur traders settled permanently here in 1768.
in 1783, united empire loyalists were settled in ste. anne's point after the american revolution, having left their properties in the united states. they were granted land in compensation in british north america by the crown. many died during the harsh and long first winter in fredericton. the dead were buried in what became the loyalist cemetery, which is still found on the south bank of the saint john river. when spring came, more loyalists left the new settlement to take up land grants in other areas.
when new brunswick became a separate colony from nova scotia in 1784, ste. anne's point became the provincial capital, winning out over parrtown (present-day saint john) due to its central inland location. this made it less prone to american attack from the sea. a street plan was laid out to the west of the original townsite, king's college (now the university of new brunswick) was founded, and the locale was renamed "frederick's town", in honour of the second son of king george iii of the united kingdom, prince frederick augustus, duke of york. the name was shortened to fredericton shortly after the city became the official provincial capital of new brunswick on 25 april 1785. thus, in a period of less than three years, the area of fredericton went from being a sparsely populated region to being the capital of the new colony of new brunswick.
the same attributes that made fredericton the capital city also made it an ideal spot for a military installation. many of the original military buildings downtown still stand, and are now tourist attractions.
the building constructed to house the colonial-era legislative assembly in 1788 was destroyed by a fire in 1880. two years later, the present legislature building was constructed.
the first major expansion of the city occurred on 1 july 1945 when it amalgamated with the town of devon. today the city of fredericton comprises fredericton proper, and the boroughs of silverwood, nashwaaksis, barker's point and marysville, which were incorporated into the city in 1973.
the commemorative brass cenotaph plaques were stolen in october 2015, and were replaced by replicas cast by an amherst foundry called liberty enterprises.
one of the communities amalgamated into fredericton in 1973, marysville, has a unique and distinctive history of its own. marysville is located on the nashwaak river, a tributary of the saint john river, just north of pre-1973 fredericton. the community is distinguished by its 19th-century mill and historic buildings, which include 19th-century company houses and buildings patterned after those of british industrial towns.
marysville can be described as a prime example of a 19th-century mill town. in the 1830s a sawmill was built on the site of marysville by two local entrepreneurs. however, the mill frequently changed ownership and never showed a profit. alexander gibson (popularly referred to as "boss gibson") turned this situation around and built a prosperous industrial town. in 1883, under the direction of gibson, construction began of a cotton mill, which was state-of-the-art for its time. "boss" gibson named the company town that grew up around the mill marysville in honour of his wife.
in 1908, having faced financial problems, gibson sold the mill to a montreal-based company which, in turn, sold it to canadian cottons ltd. after world war ii, foreign competition devastated the mill's business; jobs moved offshore and it ceased operations in 1954. there were numerous attempts to re-open the mill; however, in 1980, it closed its doors permanently. the mill was renovated and re-opened in 1985 for use as provincial government offices. the mill remains the dominant feature in the marysville skyline.
on 10 august 2018, a mass shooting took place on brookside drive that left four people dead, including two police officers.
the saint john river runs through fredericton, with most of the city's post-war suburban development occurring on the gently sloping hills on either side of the river (although the downtown core is flat and lies low to the river).
at an altitude of about above sea level, fredericton is nestled in the pennsylvanian basin. it differs markedly from the geologically older parts of the province. there are prominently two distinct areas in the region that are divided around the area of wilsey road, in the east end of the city. in the west side, the bedrock underneath the earth is topographically dominant, whereas the other is controlled by pleistocene and recent deposits leading to the rivers (resulting in the area being shallow and wide). fredericton and its surroundings are rich in water resources, which, coupled with highly arable soil, make the fredericton region ideal for agriculture. the saint john river and one of its major tributaries, the nashwaak river, come together in fredericton. the uninhabited parts of the city are heavily forested.
fredericton has a humid continental climate (köppen climate classification "dfb"). the average january low temperature is , while the average high in july is . on average, fredericton receives approximately of precipitation per year. snowfall is common between late november and early april, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in december. flooding occurs during the spring of most years on area rivers and affects the city's low-lying neighbourhoods. its climate is somewhat influenced by its inland position, with warmer summers and colder winter nights than expected for coastal areas of new brunswick and nova scotia.
the highest temperature ever recorded in fredericton was on 18 august 1935. the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 19 january 1925.
fredericton has a mayor-council and non-partisan form of government, with the mayor and council serving fixed four-year terms (three years until 2004), and elections held in may. the current mayor is mike o'brien, who was elected in 2016. the city is divided into twelve wards (six on each side of the saint john river), with each ward electing one councillor.
the boyce farmers market, open on saturday mornings, is a place where municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently visit to mingle with their electorate - something which has evolved into a political tradition.
provincially, fredericton elected progressive conservatives from 1952 until electoral sweep of the liberal party in 1987 when they won every seat in new brunswick under frank mckenna. since then there has been greater political alteration in the provincial electoral landscape in fredericton.
in 1991, the right-wing confederation of regions party won the riding of fredericton north (along with several other nearby ridings). in 1999 progressive conservatives swept all three fredericton area seats; however, in 2003, fredericton-north and fredericton-fort nashwaak returned to the liberals.
federally, the city forms most of the riding of fredericton. this riding was known as fredericton-york-sunbury but was redistributed prior to the 1997 general election. from 1957 until 1993 fredericton returned progressive conservatives. in the 2008 federal election, the candidate of the conservative party of canada, former new maryland mla keith ashfield, won this seat with 42% of the popular vote.
architecturally, fredericton spans more than two centuries. the city features an eclectic mix of buildings and residences ranging from classical victorian style to modern office buildings and architecture. fredericton’s skyline is also distinguished by many historic churches. there are 12 national historic sites of canada in fredericton.
neighbourhoods in fredericton include:
the city of fredericton is bisected by the saint john river. this has created two distinctive regions of the city characterized as the "northside" and the "southside". the southside is characterized by a downtown core consisting of provincial government departments, historical buildings, and numerous business establishments, banks, and law firms. downtown also hosts many of the city's cultural attractions, such as the playhouse, the fredericton region museum (formerly the york-sunbury museum), the beaverbrook art gallery and science east, new brunswick's science centre. many notable historical buildings are also located in or near downtown, including grand victorian-era residences, the new brunswick legislative building, and christ church cathedral. south of downtown, the city's elevation rises along a sloping hill (part of the river valley feature of the city).
"the hill", as it is called, includes an area known as "college hill", where the adjoining campuses of the university of new brunswick and st. thomas university are located, slightly southeast of the downtown area. southwest of the universities on the crest of the hill, near the highway interchange between route 8 and route 7, is the dr. everett chalmers regional hospital. east of the universities is the skyline acres/southwood park area, consisting of a core of older established suburbs, and newer, more affluent areas such as poets hill.
occupying the hill southwest of downtown is odell park, a large preserved forest area. its trails and wooded areas are a favourite for hiking, jogging, dog walking, and cross-country skiing for city residents. odell park borders on the fredericton botanic garden. west of the park and garden is hanwell road, golf club road, and silverwood neighbourhoods consisting largely of suburban residences.
south of the "hill area", where it plateaus, is a sizeable shopping district consisting of the city's largest mall, the regent mall; two big-box retail complexes, corbett centre and uptown centre; and numerous adjacent strip malls and restaurants.
the city's "northside" consists of several boroughs which were, at one time, separate communities. these include devon, nashwaaksis, marysville and barker's point. these communities are largely suburban neighbourhoods and retail outlets. main street (in nashwaaksis) which becomes union street in devon, runs along the northern bank of the saint john river. it includes numerous retail outlets as well as an eclectic array of businesses including it firms, law firms, and real estate agents. also located on the northside is the brookside mall, a retail mall anchored by sobeys, alcool nb liquor and a lawtons drugs store as well as government offices. a new retail "power centre" development including canadian tire/marks work warehouse, kent building supplies and a wal-mart, is located at two-nations crossing. willie o'ree place - a new multimillion-dollar hockey complex - opened in the same area in 2007.
the northside is also home to the saint mary's first nation indian reserve, which includes a community centre and a shopping centre. during the christmas season, the neighbourhood has some of the most spectacular and creative decorations in the city.
due to the presence of the universities, fredericton is more cosmopolitan than many cities its size. this is reflected in cuisine offered by local ethnic restaurants (which include caribbean, chinese, greek, indian, korean, italian, japanese, lebanese, mexican, pakistani and vietnamese foods). there are also several retail outlets that sell ethnic products and artifacts. the federal government named fredericton the "cultural capital of canada" for the year 2009. officers' square is an outdoor public space located at the centre of the city. it serves as a venue for outdoor concerts during the summer, featuring a variety of local and national talent. during the winter, officers' square is transformed into an outdoor skating rink.
fredericton is an important cultural centre of the region featuring art galleries, the new brunswick college of craft and design, museums and theatres which promote local artistic and literary talent. the beaverbrook art gallery is new brunswick's provincial art gallery. it was established in 1959 by lord beaverbrook as a gift to his native province. fredericton is also home to several commercial art galleries.
the playhouse hosts plays and musicals throughout the year, as well as presenting visiting comedians and musical performances by both canadian and international artists. the playhouse is the main venue for theatre new brunswick (tnb). tnb was founded by prominent canadian director walter learning in 1969, and is the province’s largest professional theatre company.
every fall fredericton hosts the harvest jazz & blues festival. the week-long festival draws artists from all over north america. since its inception in 1991, the event has grown into a large, diverse festival which has attracted artists from around the world including buddy guy, warren haynes, oscar peterson, and parliament.
fredericton is home to the new brunswick summer music festival, which, each august, features professional chamber music by top local players and nationally renowned performers. motion ensemble, nb’s contemporary music organization, is also based here. in addition, symphony new brunswick performs most of its season in fredericton.
every november fredericton hosts the silver wave film festival. originally called the tidal wave film festival, it has been running since 2001. each year attendance and interest in the festival has risen. because of the its relationship with the toronto international film festival, the silver wave festival offers frederictonians the opportunity to see films that would otherwise be overlooked in their smaller market. films created by new brunswickers are also screened at the festival. many of the local films come from shorts created through the university of new brunswick and the new brunswick filmmaker's co-operative.
fredericton has been called the poets' corner of canada, because it was the birthplace of bliss carman, charles g. d. roberts and francis joseph sherman. for many years, it was the home of the acclaimed governor general's award-winning poet, playwright, and journalist alden nowlan.
prominent writers and poets living in fredericton include raymond fraser, robert gibbs, m.t. dohaney, herb curtis, wayne curtis, david adams richards, robert hawkes, shari andrews, mark anthony jarman, gerard beirne and joe blades.
fredericton contains many public parks featuring preserved forest lands - such as odell park and reading park. odell park is adjacent to the fredericton botanic garden. furthermore, fredericton features tree-lined streets and elm trees in particular which have earned the city its nickname "the city of stately elms". fredericton's parks and public spaces include:
there are no professional sports teams in fredericton, although both universities have extensive athletic programs. the unb varsity reds and st. thomas tommies are rivals in most sports. when their women's hockey teams play (stu has no men's hockey program in the aus), the matches are called the "battle of the hill". the first national championship ever won by unb was in the fall of 1980. the men's soccer team under the leadership of coaches gary brown and robin hopper defeated sir wilfred laurier 3-1 on a frigid day in november. the unb varsity reds men hockey team has experienced recent success in national competition, winning canadian interuniversity sport (now known as u sports) championships in the 1997-98, 2006-07, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012-13, 2015–16, 2016-17, and 2018-19 seasons (8 titles). they have also finished in second place in the 1996-97,1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007–2008, and 2014-15 championships. this success has produced two milestones of note: first, between 2013 and 2019 (7 years), only unb (with 3 wins) and the alberta golden bears (with 4 wins) have won the david johnston university cup (a feat only surpassed once, between 1966 and 1973). second, unb's coach gardiner macdougall, with 7 of unb's 8 championships as head coach, is the second most successful university men's hockey coach in u sport history. other varsity (aus) sports at unb include women's soccer and swimming, along with men's and women's cross country, track and field, basketball and volleyball. club sports (non-varsity) include baseball, cheerleading, cricket, fencing, football, golf, rowing, wrestling, and men's rugby.
at st. thomas university, their women's hockey (the men's program was cut due to budgetary concerns) and cross country teams compete in the aus conference of u sport, while their other sports teams (which include men's and women's soccer, rugby, golf, basketball, and volleyball) play in the atlantic collegiate athletic association (acaa) conference of the canadian collegiate athletic association (ccaa). the tommies women's hockey team has won one aus title, while the men's volleyball team has won four acaa titles, including in 2012. the men's and women's basketball teams were both 2012 ccaa bronze medalists.
fredericton's three high schools, fredericton high school (fhs), leo hayes high school (lhhs), and école sainte-anne (esa), are very competitive in a variety of sports within the new brunswick interscholastic athletics association (asinb-nbiaa). fhs, having been founded in 1800, has numerous championships across various sports, with what could be considered dynasties in football, basketball, and hockey. only founded in 1999, leo hayes has already accumulated many titles of their own, including 7 boys and 3 girls provincial aaa hockey championships, 3 provincial aaa baseball titles, as well as titles in cross-country, soccer, curling, and volleyball. école sainte-anne excels in volleyball, having won 6 of the last 10 senior boys aaa volleyball championships (including 4 in a row between 2008-09 and 2011-12).
hockey has a rich tradition in fredericton, dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. various teams from various leagues and levels have called the city home over the years. there are numerous hockey teams at all ages and levels through the fredericton youth hockey association (fyha). in april of 2019, it was announced that junior hockey would return to fredericton when the st. stephen aces were sold to a local group and renamed the fredericton red wings. this would be the first junior a team in fredericton since 1983. the new team, named for the junior red wings team which won 3 consecutive new brunswick championships from 1977-1979 (which was coached for a time by nhl alumnus and fredericton native buster harvey), will begin play in the maritime junior hockey league in september 2019. the american hockey league was once represented in fredericton, with the fredericton express playing between 1981 and 1988, and the fredericton canadiens between 1990 and 1999. fredericton has 5 permanent rink facilities which have a combined seven ice surfaces. on the northside, the york arena (opened in 1947) is the oldest arena still in use in the city. also on the northside is willie o'ree place, named after fredericton-born willie o'ree, the first black player in the national hockey league. the building, which serves as the home for the leo hayes high school lions and the fredericton midget caps, opened in 2008. it houses two nhl-sized ice surfaces, as well as meeting facilities, an indoor track and a small ymca workout centre, while outside in scotiabank park north there is a soccer field and beach volleyball courts.
on the southside, the lady beaverbrook rink (opened in 1954), the home the fredericton high school black kats, and the aitken university centre (opened in 1976 and owned by the university of new brunswick) were joined in 2012 by the new grant•harvey centre, named after fredericton-born nhl alumni danny grant and buster harvey, which is another two rink complex; one is nhl sized and the other olympic. the home for the saint thomas tommies and the fredericton junior red wings, the grant•harvey centre also houses a walking track and meeting facilities. behind the arena is the new abony family tennis centre, a six court indoor tennis facility and to the south, scotiabank park south has an artificial turf soccer pitch as well as a two-acre, fenced dog park.
fredericton has a strong rugby history with the fredericton loyalists rfc. each summer the loyalists host the new brunswick black spruce team which competes in the rugby canada super league.
there are healthy programs in both baseball and softball at all age levels around the city. the fredericton u18 twins hosted the canadian u18 softball fast pitch championships in 2011 and 2012, while the senior twins hosted the national senior fast pitch championships in 2012. in baseball, the fredericton senior royals celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2011 and their 11th (17th including when the team was the marysville royals) new brunswick senior baseball league championship in 2012. that same royals program produced matt stairs, a major league baseball player who played for team canada in the 1988 summer olympics and won the world series with the philadelphia phillies in 2008.
fredericton has several large parks, including odell park, reading park, queen's square, officer's square, carleton park and wilmot park. killarney lake and nearby mactaquac provincial park have small beaches which are popular in the summer. these, along with the river, provide excellent venues for water sports. skiing and snowboarding at nearby crabbe mountain are also common winter activities among city residents, as is skating on the outdoor rinks at officer's and queen's squares. there are also several trails within the city which are used in the winter for cross-country skiing. fredericton also boasts public and private facilities for archery, soccer, track and field, golf, football, fencing, rowing, sailing, swimming, curling, martial arts, bowling, paintball, and lawn bowling.
the population of fredericton is 56,224 (2011 census). along with moncton and halifax, fredericton is one of three maritime cities to register a population increase in recent years.
fredericton's population is predominantly white. however, a black minority has had a long presence in the city, primarily in the barker's point borough. willie o'ree, the first black player in the nhl, is from fredericton. the largest non-white segment of fredericton's population is made up of first nations people, who live primarily on the saint mary's reserve located in the city's north side.
in the 1960s and 1970s, an influx of immigrants from asia and the middle east began, although their numbers remain small. since 2000, the city's universities, saint thomas university and the university of new brunswick, have seen a growing number of students from overseas attending. visible minorities comprise 9.9% of the city's population.
as of 2017, over 500 refugees from the syrian civil war have immigrated to the fredericton area, more per capita than anywhere else in canada, and equal to approximately 1% of the city's population.
while a predominantly anglophone city, the civil service has seen an increase in the city's francophone population. this population is served by the centre communautaire sainte-anne (which includes k-12 schooling, a radio station, a public library, and cultural centre). in addition, fredericton is served by a francophone church located on regent street.
the linguistic breakdown of fredericton is as follows:
the residents of fredericton are predominantly christian, with protestants forming the largest denomination. the city is notable for its many churches, a high number per capita in comparison to most other canadian cities. the small pentecostal northeast christian college is located on the city's north side. while the roman catholic population is not as large, the city does have the province's only roman catholic university, st. thomas university.
fredericton has a synagogue, a mosque, and a hindu temple as well. the importance of these institutions has been growing in recent years warranting visits by prominent politicians in the area seeking election. on 9 october 2011, a swastika was scrawled on the front door of the community's synagogue, and was investigated as a potential hate crime. a unitarian fellowship has been serving fredericton since 1960 as a place for people to find a liberal religious home. fredericton also hosts a shambhala buddhist meditation centre.
during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the lumber industry, with its corresponding mills, was a primary sector of fredericton's economy. over the course of the 20th century, this industry declined and gave way to the provincial government and the universities becoming the primary employers in the city.
the policies of centralizing provincial government functions during the 1960s under new brunswick premier louis robichaud - along with the expanded role of the public sector characteristic of the 1960s/70s - led to a sizeable expansion of the city's population. it was during these decades that the hill area on the city's southside was largely developed and bedroom communities such as new maryland emerged.
the 1960s also saw an expansion of the university of new brunswick due to increased post-war university enrolment, as well as the construction of the fredericton campus of saint thomas university. also contributing to this expansion was the move of the law school from saint john to the fredericton area. this expansion of the post-secondary sector also contributed to fredericton's population growth during the 1960s and 1970s. since then, the city's population has continued to grow though at a slower rate due to slower growth of the government sector, along with hiring freezes and in some cases layoffs, during the frank mckenna and bernard lord governments.
in recent years, increased student enrolment at the city's universities has led to greater demand for rental property. this has led to the construction of new university residences and apartment buildings in the city, and increased rates of rent, making them the highest rental rates in the province.
the predominance of the universities and government provide fredericton with a measure of economic stability. the city has not been subject to the uncertainty and hardships faced by atlantic canadian cities dealing with mill shutdowns and the decline of the mining and fishing industries. for this reason, fredericton is one of the few atlantic canadian cities that has actually reported a population increase in recent years.
the city has been investing actively in it infrastructure. the city of fredericton won the "judges innovation award" at the 2004 canadian information productivity awards due to their "fred-ezone" free municipality wide wifi network initiative. this and other innovations by the city's utelco, e-novations, led intel to do a case study on their successes. fred-ezone spans much of the city’s downtown and parts of surrounding residential areas, as well as peripheral commercial areas such as fredericton's regent mall. in 2008 and 2009 the intelligent community forum selected fredericton as a top 7 intelligent community, based partly on the city's work in the it sector.
the greater fredericton region has also established an investment attraction program called invest greater fredericton. the purpose is to provide investors and site selectors with one central source for economic information such as real estate, demographics, key industries and more.
fredericton's public schools are located in either the anglophone west school district (formerly known as district 18, and prior to that, district 26) or the district scolaire francophone sud (district 1). fredericton is home to three public high schools, two operating in the english language and one in the french language. fredericton high school, which was once the largest school in the commonwealth of nations, operates in english and primarily serves students living on fredericton's south side. it is also one of the oldest public high schools in canada, tracing its beginnings to 1785 – having celebrated its bicentennial in 1985. fredericton high school is home to several sports teams – including basketball, hockey, soccer, and football – which dominated new brunswick provincial high school sports championships during much of the 1980s and 1990s. the school motto is "palma non sine pulvere", latin for "no reward without effort" (literally "no palm without dust").
leo hayes high school, which opened in 1999, also operates in english and primarily serves students living on fredericton's north side. the high school is a public private partnership, known as a p3. leo hayes' current principal is brad sturgeon. the motto of the school is "somnia sunt circuli veritatis", latin for "dreams are the seedlings of reality". leo hayes high school places priority on both arts and athletics, in addition to academia. in addition, there are four middle schools, fourteen elementary schools and three private schools in the city. a recent issue with middle schools in the city has been the location of george street middle school and albert street middle school close to the city centre. this fails to account for the city's changing demographic which has seen the growth of suburban neighbourhoods. in 2009 albert street middle school was replaced by bliss carman middle school, located in the kimble road park area of skyline acres. albert street middle school has since been demolished, with a ymca building having been erected in its place.
fredericton is also served by école sainte-anne (esa), which provides french language education for grades 6-12, and "école des bâtisseurs" (opened in 2007) and école les éclaireurs (opened in 2015), which provide k-5 education on the north and south side, respectively. école sainte-anne is in the same building as that used by the french community centre - the centre communautaire sainte-anne, which also houses the french public library, the dr. marguérite michaud library, and an amphitheatre. the current principal of esa is gabrielle mclaughlin.
fredericton is also home to a private christian school which is located on the northside. its current headmaster is jonathan mcaloon and the principal is scott robertson.
fredericton's status as an educational centre is evident in the city's two degree-granting universities: the university of new brunswick and st. thomas university. the university of new brunswick (unb) was founded in 1785, making it the oldest public university in north america, compared to the oldest private university, harvard university, in 1636. built in 1826, unb's old arts building is the oldest university building still in use in canada. unb also houses renaissance college, which is a leading leadership training institution in new brunswick. unb houses a faculty of law which is one of two anglophone common-law schools in atlantic canada.
st. thomas university (stu) is the province's only catholic university and has been located in fredericton since 1964, when it moved from its chatham, new brunswick campus. it is a liberal arts university with programs in gerontology, criminology, journalism, social work, native studies, and education. stu offers an excellent program in human rights and is the home of the atlantic human rights research and development centre.
fredericton is also home to several colleges and similar institutions. the new brunswick college of craft and design houses the province's leading programs in photography and visual arts. the fredericton location of the new brunswick community college is on the campus of the university of new brunswick. the maritime college of forest technology maintains its english-language campus in the city. mcft is a small post-secondary school training students from across the maritime provinces.
other institutions include eastern college, atlantic business college and 3d and 2d animation schools such as davinci college and the gaming and animation institute of fredericton. located on the north side is a small pentecostal college, the northeast christian college, which trains and certifies pentecostal ministers.
alongside fredericton's more established universities, the city also is home to several online for-profit universities. university of fredericton (ufred) and yorkville university are operational. the university of fredericton was founded in 2006, making it the youngest private university in canada. it is a degree-granting online university providing certificate and graduate degree programs in business leadership. ufred offers mba and emba programs under section 3 of the degree granting act of the province of new brunswick in canada. yorkville offers graduate programs in counselling psychology and adult education. meritus closed in 2012. these universities typically have offices downtown.
fredericton hosts several major research centres - dealing with policy development, agriculture, forestry, and engineering. these research institutions are connected to the city's two universities as well as the provincial and federal governments.
the hugh john flemming forestry centre (including provincial and federal departments) is the leading forestry research centre in atlantic canada. this centre carries out major research endeavours in forestry management and scientific research. the centre closely collaborates with the forestry department at the university of new brunswick which is one of the top forestry departments in canada. as well, research and development in agriculture and crop development is carried out at the agricultural research station in lincoln.
the university of new brunswick is the site of several major research centres in social science, forestry, geomatics and biomedical engineering, and policy development. these include the centre for conflict studies, which carries out research on military and strategic issues and the muriel mcqueen fergusson centre for family violence research, which carries out multi-disciplinary research on family violence issues. furthermore, the institute of biomedical engineering has completed groundbreaking work on prosthetic limbs to aid war amputees in developing countries.
as well, the city's growing it sector has been the basis for new research on it and computer programming development, including the october 2002 opening of the national research council of canada institute for information technology – e-business facility, located on the university of new brunswick campus.
fredericton is also the home of new brunswick's provincial research organization (pro), rpc. rpc specializes in applied research and technical services in support of new brunswick industry. specializations include capabilities in aquaculture, mining, manufacturing, energy and the environment.
air service is provided out of the fredericton international airport, located approximately 15 kilometres east of downtown in lincoln. it is served by air canada express, which operates direct flights to toronto, ottawa, montreal and halifax. it also has service from porter airlines 5 days a week to ottawa. seasonal direct flights are also offered to cuba and the caribbean during the late winter and early spring months. as of may 2015, westjet encore provides daily q400 turboprop service to toronto.
fredericton transit provides bus transit service to most areas of the city. all city buses feature bike racks so that cyclists can take advantage of bus services as well. fredericton is also served by several taxi companies. the major companies in alphabetical order are: abc car services, checker cab, george's skycab, loyal taxi, standard taxi and trius taxi. fredericton started installing bicycle lanes in july 2008, with a plan to establish 45 kilometres of on-street painted bicycle lanes, and 39 kilometres of signed bicycle routes, by 2011.
there is no rail service into fredericton. passenger services started in 1869 and ended in the 1960s. the via rail "atlantic" passenger train ran for many years between saint john and montreal, stopping at fredericton junction, about 28 kilometers south of fredericton, and passing through maine. the service was cancelled in the via rail cuts of 1981, but was resumed in 1985. in 1994, canadian pacific announced that it would abandon its railway line through maine and new brunswick, which led to via rail cancelling the atlantic train service. the last passenger train left fredericton junction in november 1994. freight service to fredericton ended in 1996, and all railway tracks have been abandoned and removed. the city joined st. john's and charlottetown as canada's only provincial capitals without a rail service. since 1 december 2012, fredericton has been served by maritime bus connections to points throughout eastern canada.
fredericton is located on the trans-canada highway, which passes along the southern municipal boundary. routes 7 and 8 (the latter being a former alignment of the trans-canada) also pass through the city. two highway bridges, the westmorland street bridge and the princess margaret bridge, cross the saint john river. those bridges feed into controlled-access roads (routes 8 and 105 serving the city's north side.) the city's highway system is mostly complete, and traffic jams rarely occur.
streets in downtown follow a grid pattern. in residential areas of downtown, some neighbourhoods are traffic-calmed and include traffic circles at intersections to slow the speed of cars and discourage thoroughfare traffic. northumberland street and odell avenue have adopted speedbumps to slow fast moving traffic. the pattern of streets in the rest of the city varies including straight thoroughfares (such as smythe street, prospect street and regent street), to curved streets and cul-de-sacs in primarily residential areas.
fredericton has a network of 25 trails totalling more than on both sides of the saint john and nashwaak rivers. many of the city trails are rail trails that follow old railway lines. these include the old train bridge that spans 0.6 km across the saint john river, providing a panoramic view of downtown fredericton. the rail trail system in fredericton is part of the sentier nb trail system and some of these trails are also part of the larger trans-canada trail network. some sections of the trail system are being paved to make it more accessible to non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles and wheelchairs.
railway service through fredericton was discontinued by cp rail in fall 1993 and cn rail in spring 1996. following abandonment, both companies sold their right-of-ways to the provincial government which developed the trail network in partnership with the city and volunteer trail organizations. the trails are used by residents for walking, biking, and jogging and boast several scenic vistas along the saint john and nashwaak rivers as well as a mix of urban and wooded/natural scenery.
on the south side of the city, cp rail's fredericton subdivision enters the city from rusagonis-waasis to the south, following the wilsey road and beaverbrook street to the former railway yard where a sobeys supermarket has been built along regent street. the former cp passenger station (york street railway station) is located at the end of the fredericton subdivision and, after sitting abandoned for decades, was renovated into a winery and liquor store in 2011.
on the north side of the city, cp rail's gibson subdivision enters the city from douglas in the west, following the saint john river through nashwaaksis to south devon. cp rail's minto subdivision enters the city from barker's point in the east and follows the saint john river to south devon and crossing the nashwaak river. cp rail's marysville spur runs from barker's point to marysville along the east bank of the nashwaak river.
on the south side, cn rail's oromocto subdivision enters the city from lincoln in the east and parallels the former cp line to the downtown rail yard and york street station. cn's former centreville subdivision continues beyond the station to silverwood in the west; this rail line was abandoned west of the hanwell road after the mactaquac dam opened in 1968 and flooded the right-of-way through to woodstock. cn rail's nashwaak subdivision joined the oromocto subdivision at una junction, immediately north of beaverbrook street opposite the university of new brunswick campus. the line proceeds north, crossing the saint john river on the fredericton railway bridge, to the former railway yard in south devon where cp rail's gibson and minto subdivisions join. the nashwaak subdivision continues up the nashwaak river valley to mcgivney.
reading park trail ( ) is a 1.1 km forested trail going through reading park in skyline acres on the city's south side. protected by trees, and constructed in a loop, reading park trail is commonly used by city residents to walk their dogs. it's also a destination for bird watchers, as the park's old-growth forest is one of the city's last remaining habitats for the pileated woodpecker.

free software or libre software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions. free software is a matter of liberty, not price: users—individually or in cooperation with computer programmers—are free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. computer programs are deemed free insofar as they give users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the first, thereby allowing them to control what their devices are programmed to do.
the right to study and modify a computer program entails that source code—the preferred format for making changes—be made available to users of that program. while this is often called 'access to source code' or 'public availability', the free software foundation recommends against thinking in those terms, because it might give the impression that users have an obligation (as opposed to a right) to give non-users a copy of the program.
although the term "free software" had already been used loosely in the past, richard stallman is credited with tying it to the sense under discussion and starting the free-software movement in 1983, when he launched the gnu project: a collaborative effort to create a freedom-respecting operating system, and to revive the spirit of cooperation once prevalent among hackers during the early days of computing.
free software thus differs from:
for software under the purview of copyright to be free, it must carry a software license whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the public domain, is free as long as the source code is in the public domain too, or otherwise available without restrictions.
proprietary software uses restrictive software licences or eulas and usually does not provide users with the source code. users are thus legally or technically prevented from changing the software, and this results on reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support. (see also vendor lock-in and abandonware). users often may not reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute proprietary software. beyond copyright law, contracts and lack of source code; there could be additional shenanigans keeping users from exercising freedom over a piece of software, such as software patents and digital rights management (more specifically, tivoization).
it must be noted that free software can be a for-profit, commercial activity or not. some free software is developed by volunteer computer programmers while other is developed by corporations; or even by both.
although both definitions refer to almost equivalent corpora of programs, the free software foundation recommends using the term "free software" rather than "open-source software" (a younger vision coined in 1998), because the goals and messaging are quite dissimilar. "open source" and its associated campaign mostly focus on the technicalities of the public development model and marketing free software to businesses, while taking the ethical issue of user rights very lightly or even antagonistically. stallman has also stated that considering the practical advantages of free software is like considering the practical advantages of not being handcuffed, in that it is not necessary for an individual to consider practical reasons in order to realize that being handcuffed is undesirable in itself.
the fsf also notes that "open source" has exactly one specific meaning in common english, namely that "you can look at the source code." it states that while the term "free software" can lead to two different interpretations, at least one of them is consistent with the intended meaning unlike the term "open source". the loan adjective "libre" is often used to avoid the ambiguity of the word "free" in english language, and the ambiguity with the older usage of "free software" as public-domain software. see "gratis" versus "libre".
the first formal definition of free software was published by fsf in february 1986. that definition, written by richard stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms. the numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of zero-based numbering in programming languages, but also because "freedom 0" was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.
freedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.
thus, free software means that computer users have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. to summarize this into a remark distinguishing "libre" (freedom) software from "gratis" (zero price) software, the free software foundation says: "free software is a matter of liberty, not price. to understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer. see "gratis" versus "libre".
in the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. the most notable are debian free software guidelines published in 1997, and the open source definition, published in 1998.
the bsd-based operating systems, such as freebsd, openbsd, and netbsd, do not have their own formal definitions of free software. users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive. they generally advocate permissive free-software licenses, which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally "forced" to provide the source code. their view is that this permissive approach is more free. the kerberos, x11, and apache software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.
there are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the internet. users can easily download and install those applications via a package manager that comes included with most linux distributions.
the free software directory maintains a large database of free-software packages. some of the best-known examples include the linux kernel, the bsd and linux operating systems, the gnu compiler collection and c library; the mysql relational database; the apache web server; and the sendmail mail transport agent. other influential examples include the emacs text editor; the gimp raster drawing and image editor; the x window system graphical-display system; the libreoffice office suite; and the tex and latex typesetting systems.
from the 1950s up until the early 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the "software freedoms" associated with free software, which was typically public-domain software. software was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and by hardware manufacturers who welcomed the fact that people were making software that made their hardware useful. organizations of users and suppliers, for example, share, were formed to facilitate exchange of software. as software was often written in an interpreted language such as basic, the source code was distributed to use these programs. software was also shared and distributed as printed source code (type-in program) in computer magazines (like creative computing, softside, compute!, byte etc) and books, like the bestseller "basic computer games". by the early 1970s, the picture changed: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of "free" software bundled with hardware product costs. in "united states vs. ibm", filed january 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anti-competitive. while some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. in the 1970s and early 1980s, the software industry began using technical measures (such as only distributing binary copies of computer programs) to prevent computer users from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. in 1980, copyright law was extended to computer programs.
in 1983, richard stallman, one of the original authors of the popular emacs program and a longtime member of the hacker community at the mit artificial intelligence laboratory, announced the gnu project, the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary unix-compatible operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. in his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to non-disclosure agreements and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional hacker ethic. software development for the gnu operating system began in january 1984, and the free software foundation (fsf) was founded in october 1985. he developed a free software definition and the concept of "copyleft", designed to ensure "software freedom" for all.
some non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under copyleft licenses (see the opencores project, for instance). creative commons and the free-culture movement have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.
in 1983, richard stallman, longtime member of the hacker community at the mit artificial intelligence laboratory, announced the gnu project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. software development for the gnu operating system began in january 1984, and the free software foundation (fsf) was founded in october 1985. an article outlining the project and its goals was published in march 1985 titled the gnu manifesto. the manifesto included significant explanation of the gnu philosophy, "free software definition" and "copyleft" ideas.
the linux kernel, started by linus torvalds, was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. the first licence was a proprietary software licence. however, with version 0.12 in february 1992, he relicensed the project under the gnu general public license. much like unix, torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.
freebsd and netbsd (both derived from 386bsd) were released as free software when the usl v. bsdi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. openbsd forked from netbsd in 1995. also in 1995, the apache http server, commonly referred to as apache, was released under the apache license 1.0.
all free-software licenses must grant users all the freedoms discussed above. however, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of license technicalities. programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.
the majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. the most popular of these licenses are:
the free software foundation and the open source initiative both publish lists of licenses that they find to comply with their own definitions of free software and open-source software respectively:
the fsf list is not prescriptive: free-software licenses can exist that the fsf has not heard about, or considered important enough to write about. so it's possible for a license to be free and not in the fsf list. the osi list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. all open-source licenses must meet the open source definition in order to be officially recognized as open source software. free software, on the other hand, is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the free software definition cannot rightly be considered free software.
apart from these two organizations, the debian project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their debian free software guidelines. debian doesn't publish a list of "approved" licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. that is summarized at the debian web site.
it is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the fsf guidelines does not also meet the open source definition, although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the nasa open source agreement is an osi-approved license, but non-free according to fsf).
there are different categories of free software.
there is debate over the security of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being security through obscurity. a popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.
free software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist, (this is called "security through disclosure") and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. as users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. according to richard stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden spyware functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.
some quantitative studies have been done on the subject.
in 2006, openbsd started the first campaign against the use of binary blobs in kernels. blobs are usually freely distributable device drivers for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. this restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have bugs, they pose a security risk to any operating system whose kernel includes them. the proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.
the issue of binary blobs in the linux kernel and other device drivers motivated some developers in ireland to launch gnewsense, a linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. the project received support from the free software foundation and stimulated the creation, headed by the free software foundation latin america, of the linux-libre kernel. as of october 2012, trisquel is the most popular fsf endorsed linux distribution ranked by distrowatch (over 12 months). while debian is not endorsed by the fsf and does not use linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.
selling software under any free-software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. this is true for licenses with or without copyleft.
since free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification. exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.
fees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable usb drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, crowdfunding, corporate contributions, and tax money. the selinux project at the united states national security agency is an example of a federally funded free-software project.
proprietary software, on the other hand, tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. this license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.
the free software foundation encourages selling free software. as the foundation has written, "distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. don't waste it!". for example, the fsf's own recommended license (the gnu gpl) states that "[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee."
microsoft ceo steve ballmer stated in 2001 that "open source is not available to commercial companies. the way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source." this misunderstanding is based on a requirement of copyleft licenses (like the gpl) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. this requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer. the claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and free software is also a misunderstanding. there are several large companies, e.g. red hat and ibm, which do substantial commercial business in the development of free software.
free software played a significant part in the development of the internet, the world wide web and the infrastructure of dot-com companies. free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a pure public good rather than a private good. companies that contribute to free software increase commercial innovation.
the economic viability of free software has been recognized by large corporations such as ibm, red hat, and sun microsystems. many companies whose core business is not in the it sector choose free software for their internet information and sales sites, due to the lower initial capital investment and ability to freely customize the application packages. most companies in the software business include free software in their commercial products if the licenses allow that.
free software is generally available at no cost and can result in permanently lower tco costs compared to proprietary software. with free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them. free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. however, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.
a report by standish group estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the proprietary software industry by about $60 billion per year. in spite of this, eric s. raymond argues that the term "free software" is too ambiguous and intimidating for the business community. raymond promotes the term "open-source software" as a friendlier alternative for the business and corporate world.

free may refer to:

the free software movement (fsm) or free/open-source software movement (fossm) or free/libre open-source software movement (flossm) is a social movement with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for software users, namely the freedom to run the software, to study and change the software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes. although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s hacker culture and academia, richard stallman formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the gnu project. stallman later established the free software foundation in 1985 to support the movement.
the philosophy of the movement is that the use of computers should not lead to people being prevented from cooperating with each other. in practice, this means rejecting "proprietary software", which imposes such restrictions, and promoting free software, with the ultimate goal of liberating everyone in cyberspace – that is, every computer user. stallman notes that this action will promote rather than hinder the progression of technology, since "it means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will be avoided. this effort can go instead into advancing the state of the art".
members of the free software movement believe that all users of software should have the freedoms listed in the free software definition. many of them hold that it is immoral to prohibit or prevent people from exercising these freedoms and that these freedoms are required to create a decent society where software users can help each other, and to have control over their computers.
some free software users and programmers do not believe that proprietary software is strictly immoral, citing an increased profitability in the business models available for proprietary software or technical features and convenience as their reasons.
"while social change may occur as an unintended by-product of technological change, advocates of new technologies often have promoted them as instruments of positive social change." this quote by san jose state professor joel west explains much of the philosophy, or the reason that the free source movement is alive. if it is assumed that social change is not only affected, but in some points of view, directed by the advancement of technology, is it ethical to hold these technologies from certain people? if not to make a direct change, this movement is in place to raise awareness about the effects that take place because of the physical things around us. a computer, for instance, allows us so many more freedoms than we have without a computer, but should these technological mediums be implied freedoms, or selective privileges? the debate over the morality of both sides to the free software movement is a difficult topic to compromise respective opposition.
the free software foundation also believes all software needs free documentation, in particular because conscientious programmers should be able to update manuals to reflect modification that they made to the software, but deems the freedom to modify less important for other types of written works. within the free software movement, the floss manuals foundation specialises on the goal of providing such documentation. members of the free software movement advocate that works which serve a practical purpose should also be free.
the core work of the free software movement focused on software development. the free software movement also rejects proprietary software, refusing to install software that does not give them the freedoms of free software. according to stallman, "the only thing in the software field that is worse than an unauthorised copy of a proprietary program, is an authorised copy of the proprietary program because this does the same harm to its whole community of users, and in addition, usually the developer, the perpetrator of this evil, profits from it."
some supporters of the free software movement take up public speaking, or host a stall at software-related conferences to raise awareness of software freedom. this is seen as important since people who receive free software, but who are not aware that it is free software, will later accept a non-free replacement or will add software that is not free software.
margaret s. elliot, a researcher in the institute for software at the university of california irvine, not only outlines many benefits that could come from a free software movement, she claims that it is inherently necessary to give every person equal opportunity to utilize the internet, assuming that the computer is globally accessible. since the world has become more based in the framework of technology and its advancement, creating a selective internet that allows only some to surf the web freely is nonsensical according to elliot. if there is a desire to live in a more coexistent world that is benefited by communication and global assistance, then globally free software should be a position to strive for, according to many scholars who promote awareness about the free software movement. the ideas sparked by the gnu associates are an attempt to promote a "cooperative environment" that understands the benefits of having a local community and a global community.
a lot of lobbying work has been done against software patents and expansions of copyright law. other lobbying focusses directly on use of free software by government agencies and government-funded projects.
the french gendarmerie and the french national assembly utilize linux.
congressmen edgar david villanueva and jacques rodrich ackerman have been instrumental in introducing free software in peru, with bill 1609 on "free software in public administration". the incident invited the attention of microsoft inc, peru, whose general manager wrote a letter to villanueva. his response received worldwide attention and is seen as a classic piece of argumentation favouring use of free software in governments.
gov.uk keeps a list of "key components, tools and services that have gone into the construction of gov.uk".
uruguay has a sanctioned law requiring that the state give priority to free software. it also requires that information be exchanged in open formats.
in the united states, there have been efforts to pass legislation at the state level encouraging use of free software by state government agencies.
the digital software security act (dssa) is a bill proposal to remove california state agencies ability to purchase non-free software.
the venezuelan government implemented a free software law in january 2006. decree no. 3,390 mandated all government agencies to migrate to free software over a two-year period.
the free software movement has been extensively analyzed using economic methodologies, including perspectives from heterodox economics. of particular interest to economists is the willingness of programmers in the free software movement to work, often producing higher-quality than commercial programmers, without financial compensation. in his 1998 article "the high-tech gift economy," richard barbrook suggested that the then-nascent free software movement represented a return to the gift economy building on hobbyism and the absence of economic scarcity on the internet. e. gabriella coleman has emphasized the importance of accreditation, respect, and honour within the free software community as a form of compensation for contributions to projects, over and against financial motivations.
the swedish marxian economist johan söderberg has argued that the free software movement represents a complete alternative to capitalism that may be expanded to create a post-work society. he argues that the combination of a manipulation of intellectual property law and private property to make goods available to the public and a thorough blend between labor and fun make the free software movement a communist economy.
like many social movements, the free software movement has ongoing internal conflict between the many foss organizations (fsf, osi, debian, mozilla foundation, apache foundation etc.) and their personalities. for instance there is disagreement about the amount of compromises and pragmatism needed versus the need for strict adherence to values.
although commercial free software was not uncommon at the time (see cygnus solutions for example), in 1998 after an announcement that netscape would liberate their popular web browser, a strategy session was held to develop a stronger business case for free software which would focus on technology rather than politics. after this, eric raymond and bruce perens founded the open source initiative (osi) to promote the term "open source software" as an alternative term for free software. osi wanted to address the perceived shortcomings in ambiguous "free software" term, and some members of osi in addition didn't follow the free software movement's focus on non-free software as a social and ethical problem; but instead focused on the advantages of open source as superior model for software development.
the latter became the view of people like eric raymond and linus torvalds, while bruce perens argues that open source was simply meant to popularize free software under a new brand, and even called for a return to the basic ethical principles.
some free software advocates use the term free and open-source software (foss) as an inclusive compromise, drawing on both philosophies to bring both free software advocates and open-source software advocates together to work on projects with more cohesion. some users believe that a compromise term encompassing both aspects is ideal, to promote both the user's freedom with the software and also to promote the perceived superiority of an open-source-development model. this eclectic view is reinforced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of osi-approved licenses and self-avowed open-source programs are also compatible with the free software formalisms and vice versa.
while some people prefer to link the two ideas of "open-source software" and "free software" together, they offer two separate ideas and values. this ambiguity began in 1998 when people started to use the term "open-source software" rather than "free software". people in the community of free software used these separate terms as a way to differentiate what they did. richard stallman has called open source ""a non-movement"", because it ""does not campaign for anything"". open source addresses software being open as a practical question as opposed to an ethical dilemma. in other words, it focuses more on the development. the open-source movement ultimately determines that non-free software is not the solution of best interest but nonetheless a solution.
on the other hand, the free software movement views free software as a moral imperative: that proprietary software should be rejected for selfish and social reasons, and that only free software should be developed and taught to cope with the task of making computing technology beneficial to humanity. it is argued that whatever economical or technical merits free software may have, those are byproducts stemming from the rights that free software developers and users must enjoy. an example of this would be the unlikelihood of free software being designed to mistreat or spy on users. at the same time, the benefits purveyed by the open-source movement have been challenged both from inside and outside the free software movement. it is unclear whether free and open-source software actually leads to more performant and less vulnerable code, with researchers robert glass and benjamin mako hill providing statistical insight that this is usually not the case.
regarding the meaning and misunderstandings of the word "free", those who work within the free software camp have searched for less ambiguous terms and analogies like "free beer vs free speech" in efforts to convey the intended semantics, so that there is no confusion concerning the profitability of free software. the loan adjective "libre" has gained some traction in the english-speaking free software movement as unequivocally conveying the state of being in freedom that free software refers to. this is not considered schismatic; "libre" is seen as an alternative explanatory device. in fact, free software has always been unambiguously referred to as ""libre software"" (in translation) in languages where the word "libre" or a cognate is native. in india, where free software has gained a lot of ground, the unambiguous term "swatantra" and its variants are widely used instead of "free".
the free software movement rebuts that while "free" may be prone to confuse novices because of the duplicity of meanings, at least one of the meanings is completely accurate, and that it is hard to get it wrong once the difference has been learned. it is also ironically noted that "open source" isn't exempt of poor semantics either, as a misunderstanding arises whereby people think source code disclosure is enough to meet the open-source criteria, when in fact it is not.
the switch from the free software movement to the open-source movement has had negative effects on the progression of community, according to christopher kelty who dedicates a scholarly chapter to the free software movements in "theorizing media and practice". the open-source movement denies that selectivity and the privatization of software is unethical. although the open-source movement is working towards the same social benefits as the free software movement, kelty claims that by disregarding this fundamental belief of the free software advocates, one is destroying the overall argument. if it can be claimed that it is ethical to limit the internet and other technology to only users who have the means to use this software, then there is no argument against the way things are at the moment; there is no need to complain if all morality is in effect.
although the movements have separate values and goals, people in both the open-source community and free software community collaborate when it comes to practical projects. by 2005, richard glass considered the differences to be a "serious fracture" but "vitally important to those on both sides of the fracture" and "of little importance to anyone else studying the movement from a software engineering perspective" since they have had "little effect on the field".
the two most prominent people associated with the movement, richard stallman and linus torvalds, may be seen as representatives of the value based versus apolitical philosophies, as well as the gnu versus linux coding styles. in the gnu/linux naming controversy the fsf argues for the term gnu/linux because gnu is a longstanding project to develop a free operating system, of which they assert the kernel was the last missing piece.
eric raymond criticises the speed at which the free software movement is progressing, suggesting that temporary compromises should be made for long-term gains. raymond argues that this could raise awareness of the software and thus increase the free software movement's influence on relevant standards and legislation.
richard stallman, on the other hand, sees the current level of compromise as a greater cause for worry.
stallman said that this is where people get the misconception of "free": there is no wrong in programmers' requesting payment for a proposed project. restricting and controlling the user's decisions on use is the actual violation of freedom. stallman defends that in some cases, monetary incentive is not necessary for motivation since the pleasure in expressing creativity is a reward in itself. on the other hand, stallman admits that is not easy to raise money for foss projects.
the free software movement champions copyleft licensing schema (often pejoratively called "viral licenses"). in its strongest form, copyleft mandates that any works "derived" from copyleft-licensed software must also carry a copyleft license, so the license spreads from work to work like a computer virus might spread from machine to machine. these licensing terms can only be enforced through asserting copyrights. critics of copyleft licensing challenge the idea that restricting modifications is in line with the free software movement's emphasis on various "freedoms," especially when alternatives like mit, bsd, and apache licenses are more permissive. proponents enjoy the assurance that copylefted work cannot usually be incorporated into non-free software projects. they emphasize that copyleft licenses may not attach for all uses and that in any case, developers can simply choose not to use copyleft-licensed software.
foss license proliferation is a serious concern in the foss domain due to increased complexity of license compatibility considerations which limits and complicates source code reuse between foss projects. the osi and the fsf maintain own lists of dozens of existing and acceptable foss licenses. there is an agreement among most that the creation of new licenses should be minimized at all cost and these created should be made compatible with the major existing foss licenses. therefore, there was a strong controversy around the update of the gplv2 to the gplv3 in 2007, as the updated license is not compatible with the previous version. several projects (mostly of the open source faction like the linux kernel) decided to not adopt the gplv3 while the gnu projects adopted the gplv3.

food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. it is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. the substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.
food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the international association for food protection, world resources institute, world food programme, food and agriculture organization, and international food information council. they address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.
the right to food is a human right derived from the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights (icescr), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".
most food has its origin in plants. some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.
some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. another example is blue-green algae such as spirulina. inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.
many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars.
seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. in fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (beans, peas, lentils, et cetera), and nuts. oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil), sesame, et cetera.
seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered a health food. however, not all seeds are edible. large seeds, such as those from a lemon, pose a choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contain cyanide which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.
fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may excrete the seeds some distance away. fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables. (for more information, see list of fruits.)
vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. these include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce), (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and (globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower).
animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from muscle systems or from organs.
food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). in addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.
some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source.
adulteration is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards. one form of adulteration is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. these substances may be either available food items or non-food items. among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.
camping food includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry camping and backpacking. the foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. the primary differences relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability, weight, and nutritional content.
to address these needs, camping food is often made up of either freeze-dried, precooked or dehydrated ingredients. many campers use a combination of these foods.
freeze-drying requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own. freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however, because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.
dehydration can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes. dehydration often produces a more compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.
surplus precooked military meals, meals, ready-to-eat (mres) are sometimes used by campers. these meals contain precooked foods in retort pouches. a retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial canning methods.
diet food (or "dietetic food") refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle.
the process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient. this can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as coca-cola (for example diet coke). in some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. in other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements.
in whole grain foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary fiber, to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.
finger food is food meant to be eaten directly using the hands, in contrast to food eaten with a knife and fork, spoon, chopsticks, or other utensils. in some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in "injera" bread. foods considered street foods are frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.
in the western world, finger foods are often either appetizers (hors d'œuvres) or entree/main course items. examples of these are miniature meat pies, sausage rolls, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or wings, spring rolls, miniature quiches, samosas, sandwiches, merenda or other such based foods, such as pitas or items in buns, bhajjis, potato wedges, vol au vents, several other such small items and risotto balls (arancini). other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include hamburgers, pizza, chips, hot dogs, fruit and bread.
in east asia, foods like pancakes or flatbreads ("bing" 饼) and street foods such as chuan (串, also pronounced "chuan") are often eaten with the hands.
fresh food is food which has not been preserved and has not spoiled yet. for vegetables and fruits, this means that they have been recently harvested and treated properly postharvest; for meat, it has recently been slaughtered and butchered; for fish, it has been recently caught or harvested and kept cold.
dairy products are fresh and will spoil quickly. thus, fresh cheese is cheese which has not been dried or salted for aging. soured cream may be considered "fresh" (crème fraîche).
fresh food has not been dried, smoked, salted, frozen, canned, pickled, or otherwise preserved.
freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. in the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). the freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture. quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature .
preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers. accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase. an initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the uk's waste & resources action programme) promotes the freezing of food "as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date". the food standards agency was reported as supporting the change, providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time.
a functional food is a food given an additional function (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients. the term may also apply to traits purposely bred into existing edible plants, such as purple or gold potatoes having enriched anthocyanin or carotenoid contents, respectively. functional foods may be "designed to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions, and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and consumed as part of a regular diet".
the term was first used in japan in the 1980s where there is a government approval process for functional foods called foods for specified health use (foshu).
health food is food marketed to provide human health effects beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as natural foods, organic foods, whole foods, vegetarian foods or dietary supplements. these products may be sold in health food stores or in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores.
a healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. a healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories.
for people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no processed food and sweetened beverages. the requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin b12 is needed for those following a vegan diet. various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.
a healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet. a healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer.
there are specialized healthy diets, called medical nutrition therapy, for people with various diseases or conditions. there are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets, as in dietary therapy in traditional chinese medicine.
the world health organization (who) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:
kosher foods are those that conform to the jewish dietary regulations of "kashrut" (dietary law), primarily derived from leviticus and deuteronomy. food that may be consumed according to "halakha" (law) is termed "kosher" () in english, from the ashkenazi pronunciation of the hebrew term "kashér" (), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption). food that is not in accordance with law is called "treif" (; , derived from "trāfáh") meaning "torn."
live food is living food for carnivorous or omnivorous animals kept in captivity; in other words, small animals such as insects or mice fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a zoo or as pet.
live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from alligators to various snakes, frogs and lizards, but also including other, non-reptile, non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores (for instance, skunks, which are omnivorous mammals, can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice). common live food ranges from crickets (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly available in pet stores for this reason), waxworms, mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts, to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens.
medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. in the united states they were defined in the food and drug administration's 1988 orphan drug act amendments and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act. in europe the european food safety authority established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (fsmps) in 2015.
medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in europe, are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a health claim, and from dietary supplements. in order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:
medical foods can be classified into the following categories:
natural foods and "all natural foods" are widely used terms in food labeling and marketing with a variety of definitions, most of which are vague. the term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed and whose ingredients are all natural products (in the chemist's sense of that term), thus conveying an appeal to nature. but the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing. in some countries, the term "natural" is defined and enforced. in others, such as the united states, it is not enforced.
“natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not processed, or do not contain any food additives, or do not contain particular additives such as hormones, antibiotics, sweeteners, food colors, or flavorings that were not originally in the food. in fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers) that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients. the terms are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements.
the international food and agriculture organization’s "codex alimentarius" does not recognize the term “natural” but does have a standard for organic foods.
a negative-calorie food is food that supposedly requires more food energy to be digested than the food provides. its thermic effect or specific dynamic action – the caloric "cost" of digesting the food – would be greater than its food energy content. despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. while some chilled beverages are calorically negative, the effect is minimal and drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous.
organic food is food produced by methods that comply with the standards of organic farming. standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming. in general, organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents or synthetic food additives.
currently, the european union, the united states, canada, mexico, japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders. in the context of these regulations, organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. although the produce of kitchen gardens may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the us department of agriculture (usda) or european commission (ec).
fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local ecosystems, biodiversity, groundwater and drinking water supplies, and sometimes farmer health and fertility. these environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. from a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and medical literature to support claims that organic food is safer or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food. while there may be some differences in the nutrient and antinutrient contents of organically- and conventionally-produced food, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results. claims that organic food tastes better are generally not supported by tests.
peasant foods are dishes specific to a particular culture, made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients, and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable. they often form a significant part of the diets of people who live in poverty, or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country.
peasant foods have been described as being the diet of peasants, that is, tenant or poorer farmers and their farm workers, and by extension, of other cash-poor people. they may use ingredients, such as offal and less-tender cuts of meat, which are not as marketable as a cash crop. characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals, in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth, with bread or other staple food. sausages are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.
peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations. such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes.
prison food is the term for meals served to prisoners while incarcerated in correctional institutions. while some prisons prepare their own food, many use staff from on-site catering companies. many prisons today support the requirements of specific religions, as well as vegetarianism. it is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting.
"seasonal" here refers to the times of year when the harvest or the flavour of a given type food is at its peak. this is usually the time when the item is harvested, with some exceptions; an example being sweet potatoes which are best eaten quite a while after harvest. it also appeals to people who prefer a low carbon diet that reduces the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from food consumption (food miles).
shelf-stable food (sometimes ambient food) is food of a type that can be safely stored at room temperature in a sealed container. this includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been processed so that they can be safely stored at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life.
various food preservation and packaging techniques are used to extend a food's shelf life. decreasing the amount of available water in a product, increasing its acidity, or irradiating or otherwise sterilizing the food and then sealing it in an air-tight container are all ways of depriving bacteria of suitable conditions in which to thrive. all of these approaches can all extend a food's shelf life without unacceptably changing its taste or texture.
for some foods alternative ingredients can be used. common oils and fats become rancid relatively quickly if not refrigerated; replacing them with hydrogenated oils delays the onset of rancidity, increasing shelf life. this is a common approach in industrial food production, but recent concerns about health hazards associated with trans fats have led to their strict control in several jurisdictions. even where trans fats are not prohibited, in many places there are new labeling laws (or rules), which require information to be printed on packages, or to be published elsewhere, about the amount of trans fat contained in certain products.
space food is a type of food product created and processed for consumption by astronauts in outer space. the food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled weightless environments of manned spacecraft.
in recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication. although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from the man in space committee of the space science board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.
traditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed through generations or which have been consumed many generations. traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine or local cuisine. traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.
some traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialities in the european union designations per european union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties: protected designation of origin (pdo), protected geographical indication (pgi) and traditional specialities guaranteed (tsg). these standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.
this article also includes information about traditional beverages.
whole foods are plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined, or processed and refined as little as possible, before being consumed. examples of whole foods include whole grains, tubers, legumes, fruits, vegetables.
there is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods, in particular animal foods. the modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with "whole foods plant-based diet" with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods.
the earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in the farmer, a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by f. newman turner, a writer and pioneering organic farmer. the magazine sponsored the establishment of the producer consumer whole food society ltd, with newman turner as president and derek randal as vice-president. whole food was defined as "mature produce of field, orchard, or garden without subtraction, addition, or alteration grown from seed without chemical dressing, in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes, and composts therefrom, and ground, raw rock and without chemical manures, sprays, or insecticides," having intent to connect suppliers and the growing public demand for such food. such diets are rich in whole and unrefined foods, like whole grains, dark green and yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds.
most food has always been obtained through agriculture. with increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern industrial agriculture, there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices. this approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages biodiversity, local self-reliance and organic farming methods. major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the world trade organization and common agricultural policy), national government policy (or law), and war.
in popular culture, the mass production of food, specifically meats such as chicken and beef, has come under fire from various documentaries, most recently food, inc, documenting the mass slaughter and poor treatment of animals, often for easier revenues from large corporations. along with a current trend towards environmentalism, people in western culture have had an increasing trend towards the use of herbal supplements, foods for a specific group of people (such as dieters, women, or athletes), functional foods (fortified foods, such as omega-3 eggs), and a more ethnically diverse diet.
several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised. according to the international water management institute and unep, well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fiber and animal products, they also provide services such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, erosion control and habitats for plants, birds, fish and other animals.
animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. as animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable. water, while important for survival, has no taste. fats, on the other hand, especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.
generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose. complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. other types of sugar include raw sugar, which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. as sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.
the stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.
sourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges. sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria. many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.
saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. it is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. there are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, kosher salt, mined salt, and grey salt. other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.
bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.
umami, the japanese word for delicious, is the least known in western popular culture but has a long tradition in asian cuisine. umami is the taste of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate (msg). it is characterized as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor. salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami.
many scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country, and that it can be used as a form of communication. according to goode, curtis and theophano, food "is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost".
many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as gastronomy. many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. this also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.
some popular types of ethnic foods include italian, french, japanese, chinese, american, cajun, thai, african, indian and nepalese. various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits. while evolutionarily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are omnivores, religion and social constructs such as morality, activism, or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume. food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste, the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.
aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. a common saying is that people "eat with their eyes". food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.
texture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. common examples include adding granola to yogurt, adding croutons to a salad or soup, and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.
another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. for example, such opposite flavors as sweetness and saltiness tend to go well together, as in kettle corn and nuts.
while many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, palatability, texture, or flavor. at the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. it may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, pressure cooking, fermentation, or combination with other food. in a home, most food preparation takes place in a kitchen. some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to preserve the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. a meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.
the preparation of animal-based food usually involves slaughter, evisceration, hanging, portioning, and rendering. in developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses, which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. for example, the united states has established the humane slaughter act of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. this act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as kosher, shechita, and dhabīḥah halal. strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.
on the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. in addition, fish and seafood may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. however, fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.
the term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. cooking technique, known as culinary art, generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, tools, and the skill of the individual cook. the diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.
cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional properties. cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. there is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at "homo erectus" campsites dating from 420,000 years ago. boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium bc with the introduction of pottery.
there are many different types of equipment used for cooking.
ovens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to ) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. different cuisines will use different types of ovens. for example, indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens, conventional ovens, toaster ovens, or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven. classic italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas, electric, or oil-fired.
various types of cook-tops are used as well. they carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a sauté pan, sauce pot, frying pan, or pressure cooker. these pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming, simmering, boiling, and poaching for moist methods, while the dry methods include sautéing, pan frying, and deep-frying.
in addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. a grill operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. an open pit barbecue in the american south is one example along with the american style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking. a mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa, which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. in argentina, an asado (spanish for "grilled") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.
certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a raw state. salads consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. sashimi in japanese cuisine consists of raw sliced fish or other meat, and sushi often incorporates raw fish or seafood. steak tartare and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with baguettes, brioche, or frites. in italy, carpaccio is a dish of very thinly sliced raw beef, drizzled with a vinaigrette made with olive oil. the health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above . an example of a raw meat dish is ceviche, a latin american dish made with raw meat that is "cooked" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.
restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food, and waiters to serve customers at the table. the term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in paris from the mid 18th century. these refined "restaurants" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns, and some had developed from early parisian cafés, such as café procope, by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.
commercial eateries existed during the roman period, with evidence of 150 "thermopolia", a form of fast food restaurant, found in pompeii, and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in china during the song dynasty.
in 2005, the population of the united states spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining. expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants (fast food), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and vending machines, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.
packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. this can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international food industry. early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. this mainly involved salting, curing, curdling, drying, pickling, fermenting, and smoking. food manufacturing arose during the industrial revolution in the 19th century. this development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging technology, such as milling, preservation, packaging and labeling, and transportation. it brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.
at the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food brands. there also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies. advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. computer-based control systems, sophisticated processing and packaging methods, and logistics and distribution advances can enhance product quality, improve food safety, and reduce costs.
the world bank reported that the european union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the us and japan. britain's need for food was especially well illustrated in world war ii. despite the implementation of food rationing, britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the battle of the atlantic.
food is traded and marketed on a global basis. the variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season. between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports. some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.
in 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in a dramatic increase in trade liberalization. this included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the wto enforcement of agricultural subsidy, tariffs, import quotas, and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved. where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the wto refer the dispute to the codex alimentarius commission, which was founded in 1962 by the united nations food and agriculture organization and the world health organization. trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade.
food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer. the marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. for example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup. these businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans. the food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the united states.
in the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers. with the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.
in the 20th century, supermarkets were born. supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs. in the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.
unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets. the supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to advertising, transportation, and intermediate corporations.
it is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once, but food prices suffered all-time peaks in 2008 and 2011, posting a 15% and 12% deflated increase year-over-year, representing prices higher than any data collected.
in december 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. in china, the price of pork jumped 58% in 2007. in the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. however, new trade policies had made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.
rising food prices in those years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in bangladesh and mexico, and the arab spring.
food prices worldwide increased in 2008.
one cause of rising food prices is wealthier asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. the past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while china alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry.
in 2013 overseas development institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. this was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. more fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. parts of asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. however, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in asian and african coastal cities. the researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. the research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for western african farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.
most recently, global food prices have been more stable and relatively low, after a sizable increase in late 2017, they are back under 75% of the nominal value seen during the all-time high in the 2011 food crisis.
institutions such as hedge funds, pension funds and investment banks like barclays capital, goldman sachs and morgan stanley have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years, with investment in food commodities rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. this has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the united nations. financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in wheat futures. according to olivier de schutter, the un special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following george w bush's commodities futures modernization act of 2000. de schutter told the independent in march 2012: "what we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or maize; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. the result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. this explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand." in 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the g20 to regulate the commodities market more.
some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as climate change, competition with bio-fuels and overall rising demand. however, some such as jayati ghosh, professor of economics at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi, have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from june to december 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.
food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation. this is often connected with famine, which involves the absence of food in entire communities. this can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.
starvation is a significant international problem. approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes. food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in maslow's hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales.
food aid can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. it can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required. conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop. its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as food politics. sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries. international efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the world food programme.
foodborne illness, commonly called "food poisoning", is caused by bacteria, toxins, viruses, parasites, and prions. roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version. the two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. these foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. it is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.
food poisoning has been recognized as a disease since as early as hippocrates. the sale of rancid, contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of hygiene, refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other microbiological studies by scientists such as louis pasteur, contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. this was further underpinned by the work of justus von liebig, which led to the development of modern food storage and food preservation methods. in more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the hazard analysis and critical control points (haccp), which can identify and eliminate many risks.
recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.
foods that spoil easily, such as meats, dairy, and seafood, must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. as such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as "salmonella" or "e. coli".
some people have allergies or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. this occurs when a person's immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. about 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy. the amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. in some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. common food allergens are gluten, corn, shellfish (mollusks), peanuts, and soy. allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea, rashes, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation. the digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.
rarely, food allergies can lead to a medical emergency, such as anaphylactic shock, hypotension (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. an allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although latex products can induce similar reactions. initial treatment is with epinephrine (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an epi-pen or twinject.
human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of cancers in a human epidemiological analysis by richard doll and richard peto in 1981. these cancer may be caused by carcinogens that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. food contaminated with fungal growth may contain mycotoxins such as aflatoxins which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts. other carcinogens identified in food include heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, polyaromatic hydrocarbons in charred meat and smoked fish, and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon.
anticarcinogens that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. antioxidants are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. it is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.
there are many international certifications in cooking field, such as monde selection、a.a. certification、itqi. they use the high quality evaluation methods to make the food become more safe.
many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos. dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. for example, only kosher foods are permitted by judaism, halal foods by islam, and in hinduism beef is restricted. in addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. this is highly related to a culture's cuisine.
dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of adipose tissue, known as body fat. poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. for instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, iodine deficiency. it is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to vitamin a deficiency. vitamin c deficiency results in scurvy. calcium, vitamin d, and phosphorus are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. kwashiorkor and marasmus are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.
many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. for instance, vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. others choose a healthier diet, avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and antioxidants. obesity, a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other diseases. more recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from genetically modified food. further concerns about the impact of industrial farming (grains) on animal welfare, human health, and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. this has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for organic and local food.
between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. the science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.
nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins. additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber.
as previously discussed, the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for hunters and gatherers. thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. in modern times, with advanced technology, enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.
some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word "foodstuff". these countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. the listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. in addition to these foodstuffs, drink, chewing gum, water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed, live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, cosmetics, tobacco and tobacco products, narcotic or psychotropic substances, and residues and contaminants.

floating point is an album by john mclaughlin, released in 2008 through the record label abstract logix. the album reached number fourteen on "billboard"'s top jazz albums chart.
all tracks composed by john mclaughlin
michael g. nastos of allmusic calls the album "a surprisingly fine effort, ebbing and flowing from track to track, with mclaughlin's high-level musicianship shining through, same as it ever was."
john kelman in all about jazz wrote "one of the most fluent, evocative and powerful albums in a career filled with high points"
and concludes "mclaughlin's indian friends may not have jazz in their blood the way it is in the guitarist's, but by approaching unmistakably western-informed music with an eastern mindset, they make "floating point" an album that, in mclaughlin's lengthy discography, is one of his most successful fusion records".

a fantasy sport (also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto) is a type of online game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport. these teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' in actual games. this performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager. these point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a "league commissioner" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport. in fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.
the concept of picking players and running a contest based on their year-to-date stats has been around since shortly after world war ii. one of the earliest published accounts of fantasy sports involved oakland businessman and one time oakland raiders limited partner wilfred "bill" winkenbach. he devised fantasy golf in the latter part of the 1950s. each player selected a team of professional golfers and the person with the lowest combined total of strokes at the end of the tournament would win. golf is a simple fantasy game to administer and keep tabs on, since each participant is concerned only with the scores of his or her team members without anything else to complicate it. however, it was never organized into a widespread hobby or formal business.
in oakland in 1962, winkenbach formed the first reported fantasy football league, called the greater oakland professional pigskin prognosticators league (gopppl), with eight teams. george blanda was the first player taken in the first draft in 1963.
1963 draft results
the first reported fantasy baseball league began in boston in 1960. harvard university sociologist william gamson started the "baseball seminar" where colleagues would form rosters that earned points on the players' final standings in batting average, rbi, era and wins. gamson later brought the idea with him to the university of michigan where some professors played the game. one professor playing the game was bob sklar, who taught an american studies seminar which included daniel okrent, who learned of the game his professor played. at around the same time a league from glassboro state college also formed a similar baseball league and had its first draft in 1976.
an important development in fantasy sports came with the development of rotisserie league baseball in 1980 (although research
suggests a team of players from southern new jersey have been running the same style league since 1976 making them the first rotisserie players). magazine writer/editor daniel okrent is credited with inventing it, the name coming from the new york city restaurant la rotisserie francaise where he and some friends used to meet and play. the game's innovation was that "owners" in a rotisserie league would draft teams from the list of active major league baseball players and would follow their statistics during the ongoing season to compile their scores. in other words, rather than running realistic simulations using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known, the owners would have to make similar predictions about players' playing time, health, and expected performance that real baseball managers must make.
because okrent was a member of the media, other journalists, especially sports journalists, were introduced to the game. many early players were introduced to the game by these sports journalists, especially during the 1981 major league baseball strike; with little else to write about, many baseball writers wrote columns about rotisserie league. a july 8, 1980 new york times article titled "what george steinbrenner is to the american league, lee eisenberg is to the rotisseries league" set off a media storm that led to stories about the league on cbs tv and other publications.
in march 1981, dan okrent wrote an essay about the rotisserie league for inside sports called "the year george foster wasn't worth $36." the article included the rules of the game. founders of the original rotisserie league published a guide book starting in 1984. in 1982, ballantine published the first widely available bill james abstract, which helped fuel fantasy baseball interest. fantasy fans often used james' statistical tools and analysis as a way to improve their teams. james was not a fantasy player and barely acknowledged fantasy baseball in his annual abstract, but fantasy baseball interest is credited with his strong sales.
in 1988, usa today estimated that there were thousands of leagues in the us, typically 8 to 12 players. the hobby had spread to football as well.
in the few years after okrent helped popularize fantasy baseball, a host of experts and businesses emerged to service the growing hobby. okrent, based on discussions with colleagues at usa today, credits rotisserie league baseball with much of usa today's early success, since the paper provided much more detailed box scores than most competitors and eventually even created a special paper, "baseball weekly", that almost exclusively contained statistics and box scores.
the first experts on record as having written fantasy baseball articles for usa today were john benson, alex patton, and ron shandler. perhaps the most well-known fantasy baseball expert in the late 1980s and early 1990s was benson, who published his first fantasy baseball book in 1989. later that year benson developed the first draft-simulation program, software that he still sells today.
patton published his first book ("patton's 1989 fantasy baseball league price guide") in 1989 and his dollar values were included in usa today baseball weekly's fantasy annual throughout the 1990s.
ron shandler published his "baseball superstats" book in november 1986. at first the book wasn't meant for fantasy
baseball fans, but rather as a book of sabermetric analysis.
fantasy football also saw new businesses and growth. fantasy football index became the first annual fantasy football guide in 1987. fantasy sports magazine debuted in 1989 as the first regular publication covering more than one fantasy sport. fantasy football weekly was launched in 1992 (later becoming fanball.com) and had $2 million in revenue by 1999. a large number of companies emerged to calculate the stats for fantasy leagues and primarily send results via fax.
in 1993, usa today included a weekly columnist on fantasy baseball, john hunt, and he became perhaps the most visible writer in the industry before the rise of the internet. hunt started the first high-profile experts league, the league of alternate baseball reality which first included notables as peter gammons, keith olbermann and bill james.
the hobby continued to grow with 1 million to 3 million playing from 1991 to 1994.
in early october 1995, a fantasy hockey website was released by molson breweries. it was part of the company's "i am online" strategy and centred on its "i am canadian"
advertising campaign; it would focus on music, entertainment and hockey. it allowed visitors to register accounts and participate in hockey leagues of nine teams, in which the visitor would be the general manager for one of those teams. the general manager would draft a team from a pool of nhl players, and could later negotiate trades with other teams in the league. disputes would be arbitrated by a commissioner by email. the site included updates of nhl statistics, also provided content, from the hockey hall of fame. on 24 may 1996, molson breweries won the international digital media award for best website of 1995.
commissioner.com launched on january 1, 1997 and first offered a fantasy baseball commissioner service that offered statistics, league message boards, updated box scores and other features. commissioner.com was sold to sportsline, late in 1999, for $31 million in cash and stock. by 2003, commissioner.com helped sportsline generate $11 million from fantasy revenue. commissioner.com is now the fantasy sports engine behind the cbssports.com fantasy area (after sportsline was sold to cbs in 2004).
rotonews.com launched in january 1997 and published its first player note on february 16, 1997. within two years rotonews had become one of the top ten most trafficked sports sites on the web, according to media metrix, ranking higher than such sites as nba.com. rotonews.com was sold to broadband sports in 1999 and later survived as rotowire.com.
the growth in fantasy sports revenue attracted larger media players. yahoo.com added fantasy sports in 1999 - a new business model for fantasy sports. a trade group for the industry, the fantasy sports trade association was formed in 1998.
other entries to the market during this era included fanball.com, launched in 1999 by the parent company of fantasy football weekly.
an early survey of the fantasy sports market in the u.s. in 1999 showed 29.6 million people age 18 and older played fantasy
games. however, that figure was reduced in later years when it was determined the survey also included people who play ncaa bracket pools, which are not fantasy sports, since they involved picking teams, not individual players.
while fantasy sports were fueled by the dot-com boom of the internet, there was a turbulent period when many of the high-flying internet companies of the era crashed in 2001. fanball.com went bankrupt in 2001, (later to re-emerge in 2001).
there were also different business models. rotonews.com launched the web's first free commissioner service in 1998, quickly becoming the largest league management service.
two years later the trend reversed. sportsline moved back to a pay model for commissioner services (which it largely still has today). thehuddle.com, a free site since 1997, started to charge for information. rotowire.com moved from a free model to a pay model in 2001 as well. despite the economic instability, fantasy sports started to become a mainstream hobby. in 2002, the nfl found that the average male surveyed spent 6.6 hours a week watching the nfl on tv; fantasy players surveyed said they watched 8.4 hours of nfl per week. "this is the first time we've been able to demonstrate specifically that fantasy play drives tv viewing," said chris russo, the nfl's senior vice president. the nfl began running promotional television ads for fantasy football featuring current players for the first time. previously fantasy sports had largely been seen in a negative light by the major sports leagues.
fantasy sports continued to grow with a 2003 fantasy sports trade association survey showing 15 million people playing fantasy football and spending about $150 a year on average, making it a $1.5 billion industry. more recently a 2013 article by forbes.com shows 32 million americans spend $467 per person or about $15 billion in total playing. https://www.forbes.com/sites/briangoff/2013/08/20/the-70-billion-fantasy-football-market/#30a3709d755c
in autumn 2008, the montana lottery, one of only four u.s. states to legalize sports betting at the time, began offering fantasy
sports wagering for the first time.
since 2012 there has been a boom of apps being built for fantasy.
daily fantasy sports (or dfs) contests are played across shorter periods of time, such as a single week of a season, rather than an entire season. daily fantasy games are typically played as "contests" subject to an entry fee, which funds an advertised prize pool and an administrative fee is partially collected as revenue for the service.
daily fantasy sports began to emerge in 2007 with the launch of fantasy sports live. in 2008, nbc launched snapdraft; and fanduel quickly became the prominent dfs site shortly after it launched in 2009. dfs experienced a major increase in prominence in 2014 and 2015 with the dramatic growth of two competing services: draftkings and fanduel. both received venture capital investments from various firms, including sports teams and broadcasters, and became known for running aggressive marketing campaigns with an emphasis on large cash prizes.
the legality of daily fantasy games has been challenged, with critics, as well as the state of nevada, arguing that they closer-resemble proposition wagering on athlete performance than a traditional fantasy sports game, while draftkings' ceo has referred to its games as being similar to online poker. dfs providers have cited the uigea's exemptions of fantasy sports as being a general exception for their legality; their legality is subject to how individual states classify a game of chance.
daily fantasy sports were not historically offered in 5 states [iowa, arizona, louisiana, montana, washington] that have laws stating a game that involves any chance is gambling. in addition several other states have murky legal environments for paid fantasy sports contests with negative ag opinions or in the case of nevada, requiring a gambling license. as a result, draftkings and fanduel are active in only 41 states. neither is currently accepting customers in washington, idaho, montana, arizona, hawaii, louisiana or nevada. additionally, fanduel did not accept customers from texas from 2016 to 2018, but reversed it's standing and started offering contests again. in his final remarks at the january 2016 ftsa conference in dallas, fantasy sports trade association president paul charchian said "we need to formally legalize fantasy play in 50 states."
however, since initial legal challenges, 21 states have since enacted laws confirming that dfs contests are legal games of skill. states such as iowa and alabama enacted laws to allow dfs and paid fantasy sports contests in 2019. louisiana passed a voter referendum in 2018 to allow paid fantasy sports contests, but needs to pass a law to regulate the induistry.
in may 2015, australian research company research firm ibisworld reported that fantasy sport was a $2b industry, experiencing 10.7% annual growth, and employing 4,386 people in 292 businesses.
according to the fantasy sports trade association, fantasy sports is a $7.22 billion industry with 59.3 million fantasy sports players in the united states and canada as of 2016.
a prior study conducted by the fsta in 2013, showed 33.5 million people age 12 and above in the u.s. with the 2011 fsta study showing 3.1 million people in canada played fantasy sports. a
2006 study showed 22 percent of u.s. adult males 18 to 49 years old, with internet access, play fantasy sports. fantasy sports
is estimated to have a $3–$4 billion annual economic impact across the sports industry. since 2011, yearly non-betting fantasy sports users have grown 25%. and with the help of media and the growing fantasy sports market, daily fantasy sports leagues fanduel and draftkings were able to generate over 300 million dollars in investments from companies like comcast, nbc sports, and time warner. the new development of daily fantasy sports is where major growth can be seen, "...the daily fantasy spending is where the numbers jump: $257 per year in 2015, while players only spent $5 in 2012."
in comparison to the united states, the uk has roughly 5% of the population participating, whereas the u.s. has about 10% of its population playing fantasy sports. espn super selector launched in 2001 for fantasy cricket and had 500,000 users during the 2003 icc world cup in south africa. by 2017, there were 40 million fantasy sports players in india.
the fsta industry group collected and presented statistics showing the percentage of fantasy sports players compared to the
general population in the united states and canada (age 12+).
in regards to the consumption habits of fantasy managers, demographic and psychographic research has found the average participant is: male (80%), caucasian (91%), holds a bachelor's degree or higher (70%), has more than five years of internet experience (84%), earns an average of $94,000, and spends approximately $200 on entry fees and other fantasy related costs. fantasy players were also stronger consumers of the following products compared to the general population: beer/alcohol, fast food, airline travel, video games, sports periodicals, athletic shoes, cell phones, and credit card usage.
in september 2015, forbes reported that eilers research was projecting that daily fantasy games will generate around $2.6 billion in entry fees this year and grow 41% annually, reaching $14.4 billion in 2020.
the fantasy sports trade association was formed in 1997 to represent the growing industry. beginning in 2000, the fsta has honored past members and contributors to fantasy sports with induction into its hall of fame.
the fantasy sports writers association was formed in 2004 to represent the growing numbers of journalists covering fantasy
sports exclusively. the fantasy sports association was formed in 2006 as a rival trade group, but folded in 2010.
the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of 2006 (uigea), was enacted as part of the "american values agenda" of 2006 and was added as an amendment to the unrelated safe port act. the uigea generally prohibits funds transfers to businesses engaged in unlawful internet wagering. however the uigea does not itself define unlawful internet wagering, and expressly refrains from altering the legality of any underlying conduct other than funds transfers.
while the act doesn't alter the legality of any particular activity permitted or prohibited under other laws, it does contain some express exemptions to its funds transfer prohibitions. one of these exemptions from the uigea prohibitions is for fantasy sports that meet certain criterial. specifically, fantasy sports that are based on teams of real multiple athletes from multiple real world teams, that have prizes established before the event starts, that use the skill of participants to determine the outcome, are exempted from the definition of a bet or wager that is the basis for requiring banks to identify and block funds transfers. according to congressman leach, an author of the uigea, exemptions, particularly one for fantasy sports, were included to relieve the burden of enforcement on banks and the uigea does not make fantasy sports legal.
because the uigea exempted fantasy sports from its definition of a bet or wager, there is a misconception that fantasy sports were made legal by the uigea. however the uigea is not a criminal gambling statute, and it specifically does not alter any criminal gambling laws and thus does not make fantasy sports legal. federal criminal gambling statutes are found in title 18 of u.s. code, such as the federal wire act 18 u.s. code § 1084 (which prohibits interstate sports wagering) and the illegal gambling business act 18 u.s. code § 1955 (which prohibits the interstate conduct of wagering activity prohibited under state law). by contrast, the uigea is found in title 31 with other anti-money laundering and financial crimes statutes.
whether state laws can regulate fantasy sports depends on whether fantasy sports are a form of sports wagering under federal law. this is because the federal wire act preempts state law and prohibits the conduct of sports wagering in interstate or foreign commerce. additionally, with regard to intrastate commerce, the professional and amateur sports protection act prohibits states from authorizing and regulating any wagering, lottery, betting, sweepstakes or other wagering scheme that is based directly or indirectly on games in which professional or amateur athletes participate or on the performance of any athletes in such games.
in the event that fantasy sports are not deemed to be a form of sports wagering, then states may have a role in determining their legality. under most state laws, lotteries are illegal only if they involve three elements: an entry fee (known as "consideration"), a prize (a "reward", in legal terms) and chance. whether fantasy sports are a lottery varies from state to state and hinges on the definition of "chance" that the state interprets. for some states, if skill dominates the outcome of the event, then the contest is legal, and passes what's called the "dominant factor test". other states with a stricter definition of chance, called "any chance test", have made fantasy football illegal.
several states have clarified that paid fantasy sports contests are games of skill and exempt from gambling laws, beginning with maryland in 2012.
one exception is the state of nevada, which has an exemption in paspa to allow for sports betting. the nevada attorney general issued an opinion that found daily fantasy sports to be a form of sports wagering, similar to the current wagering offered by nevada sports books. the opinions states that daily fantasy sports are not illegal in nevada; however, a sports pool license is required to conduct the activity in nevada.
several attorneys general have also issued opinions that daily fantasy sports are a form of sports wagering. a florida state attorney general's opinion in 1991 called into doubt the legality of fantasy football contests, but companies have operated in the state without any legal action. since then nine other ags have issued options, statements or formal opinions that equate dfs with gambling.
however, several other attorneys general have issued opinions that dfs are legal games of skill. in august 2015 in kansas, due to uncertainty with the state’s racing and gaming commission position, the state’s attorney general issued an opinion that daily fantasy sports was a skill game and thus permitted under state law. kansas gov. sam brownback signed legislation a month later authorizing fantasy gaming. the attorneys general of west virginia and rhode island have also issued opinions that clarified the legality of dfs and paid fantasy sports.
as of december 2017, 18 states have followed maryland to clarify that dfs and paid fantasy sports are legal contests of skill. these states include kansas (2015), indiana, virginia, missouri, massachusetts, colorado, tennessee, new york, mississippi (2016), arkansas, new jersey, vermont, new hampshire, ohio, maine, vermont, delaware, pennsylvania, connecticut (2017).
in september 2015, new jersey congressman frank pallone, who has championed legal sports betting in his state, requested a hearing from the house energy and commerce committee to examine the relationship between the professional sports leagues and the fantasy sports companies. the hearing was held in may 2015 and resulted in no proposed legislation, changes or regulations of fantasy sports.
there have been other legal cases involving fantasy sports and the use of professional athletes' statistics for purposes of scoring.
in 1996, stats, inc., a major statistical provider to fantasy sports companies, won a court case, along with motorola,
on appeal against the nba in which the nba was trying to stop stats from distributing in game score
information via a special wireless device created by motorola. the victory played a large part in defending other cases where
sports leagues have tried to suppress live in-game information from their events being distributed by other outlets. the victory also accelerated the market for
real-time statistics which were largely fueled by the growth of the fantasy sports industry.
the development of fantasy sports produced tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players
associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics. the players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. since the player names were being used as a group, the players had assigned their publicity rights to the players association who then signed licensing deals. during the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but some companies did not. the issue came to a head with the lawsuit of major league baseball advanced media (mlbam), mlb's internet company, vs. st. louis-based cbc distribution and marketing inc., the parent company of cdm sports. when cbc was denied a new licensing agreement with mlbam (they had acquired the rights from the baseball players' association) for its fantasy baseball game, cbc filed suit.
cbc argued that intellectual property laws and so-called "right of publicity" laws don't apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports. the fsta filed an amicus curiae in support of cbc, also arguing that if mlbam won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry, which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multibillion-dollar industry, and a ruling could allow the mlbam to have a monopoly over the industry.
"this will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry," said charlie wiegert, executive vice president of cbc. "the other leagues are all watching this case. if mlb prevailed, it just would have been a matter of time before they followed up. their player unions are just waiting for the opportunity."
cbc won the lawsuit as u.s. district court judge mary ann medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies. "the names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in cbc's fantasy games are not copyrightable," medler wrote. "therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players' claimed right of publicity."
the 8th circuit court of appeals upheld the decision in october 2007. "it would be strange law that a person would not have a first amendment right to use information that is available to everyone," a three-judge panel said in its ruling.
the u.s. supreme court upheld the 8th circuit court's decision by declining to hear the case in june 2008.

in several forms of football a forward pass is a throwing of the ball in the direction that the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive team's goal line. the forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between gridiron football (american football and canadian football) in which the play is legal and widespread, and rugby football (union and league) from which the north american games evolved, in which the play is illegal.
in some football codes, such as association football (soccer), the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all. in these sports, the concept of offside is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. however, this has not always been the case. some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing, while others had strict offside rules similar to rugby.
the development of the forward pass in american football shows how the game has evolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today. illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first legal forward pass in american football took place in 1906, after a change in rules. another change in rules occurred on january 18, 1951, which established that no center, tackle, or guard could receive a forward pass (unless such a player announces his intent to the referee he will be an eligible receiver, called a tackle-eligible play). today, the only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the tight ends. current rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed. the primary pass thrower is the quarterback, and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterback's success rate at passing in various situations, as well as a team's overall success at the "passing game."
in american and canadian football, a forward pass is usually referred to simply as a pass, and consists of a player throwing the football towards the opponent's goal line. this is permitted only once during a scrimmage down by the offensive team before team possession has changed, provided the pass is thrown from in or behind the neutral zone. an illegal forward pass can incur a yardage penalty and the loss of a down, although it may be legally intercepted by the opponents and advanced.
if an eligible receiver on the passing team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball. if an opposing player legally catches the ball (all defensive players are eligible receivers) it is an interception. that player's team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent's goal. if no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground. it will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down. if any player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability to catch the ball it is pass interference which draws a penalty of varying degree (largely depending upon the particular league's rules).
the person passing the ball must be a member of the offensive team, and the recipient of the forward pass must be an eligible receiver and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player.
the moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game. the pass begins the moment the passer's arm begins to move forward. if the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a fumble and therefore a loose ball. in this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. if the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched.
the quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few paces after the ball is snapped. this places him in an area called the "pocket", which is a protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side. a quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling. under nfl and ncaa rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. nfhs (high school) rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap. if he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called "intentional grounding" is assessed. in canadian football the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage—whether he is inside or outside of the "pocket"—to avoid the foul of "intentionally grounding".
if a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass (or an interception) only if a receiver catches the ball "in bounds". for a pass to be ruled complete in-bounds, depending on the rules either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries, after the ball is first grasped. in the nfl the receiver must touch the ground with both feet, but in most other codes—cfl, ncaa and high school—one foot in bounds is enough.
common to all gridiron codes is the notion of control—a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in "possession" of it, while still in bounds, as defined by his code. if the receiver handles the ball but the official determines that he was still "bobbling" it prior to the end of the play, then the pass will be ruled incomplete.
the forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal. passes "had been carried out successfully but illegally several times, including the 1876 yale–princeton game in which yale's walter camp threw forward to teammate oliver thompson as he was being tackled. princeton's protest, one account said, went for naught when the referee 'tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand' ".
the university of north carolina used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the university of georgia. however, the play was still illegal at the time. bob quincy stakes carolina's claim in his 1973 book "they made the bell tower chime":
john heisman, namesake of the heisman trophy, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the tar heels had given birth to the forward pass against the bulldogs (uga). it was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give unc a 6–0 win. the carolinians were in a punting situation and a georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. the punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by george stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.
in a 1905 experimental game at wichita, kansas, washburn university and fairmount college (what would become wichita state) used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906. credit for the first pass goes to fairmount's bill davis, who completed a pass to art solter.
1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron; the "chicago tribune" reported 18 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that season. there were moves to outlaw the game, but united states president theodore roosevelt personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed. in a meeting of more than 60 schools in late 1905, the commitment was made to make the game safer. this meeting was the first step toward the establishment of what would become the ncaa and was followed by several sessions to work out "the new rules."
the final meeting of the rules committee tasked with reshaping the game was held on april 6, 1906, at which time the forward pass officially became a legal play. "the new york times" reported in september 1906 on the rationale for the changes: "the main efforts of the football reformers have been to 'open up the game'—that is to provide for the natural elimination of the so-called mass plays and bring about a game in which speed and real skill shall supersede so far as possible mere brute strength and force of weight." however, the "times" also reflected widespread skepticism as to whether the forward pass could be effectively integrated into the game: "there has been no team that has proved that the forward pass is anything but a doubtful, dangerous play to be used only in the last extremity." john heisman was instrumental in the rules' acceptance.
in canadian football, the first exhibition game using a forward pass was held on november 5, 1921, at mcgill university in montreal, quebec, canada between the mcgill redmen football team and visiting american college football team the syracuse orangemen from syracuse university. the game was organized by frank shaughnessy, the head coach of mcgill. mcgill player robert "boo" anderson is credited with the first forward pass attempt in canadian football history.
the forward pass was not officially allowed in canadian football until 1929.
most sources credit st. louis university's bradbury robinson from bellevue, ohio with throwing the first legal forward pass. on september 5, 1906, in a game against carroll college, robinson's first attempt at a forward pass fell incomplete and resulted in a turnover under the 1906 rules. in the same game, robinson later completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to jack schneider. the 1906 st. louis team, coached by eddie cochems, was undefeated at 11–0 and featured the most potent offense in the country, outscoring their opponents 407–11. football authority and college football hall of fame coach david m. nelson wrote that "e. b. cochems is to forward passing what the wright brothers are to aviation and thomas edison is to the electric light."
while st. louis university completed the first legal forward pass in the first half of september, this accomplishment was in part because most schools did not begin their football schedule until early october.
in 1952, football coach amos alonzo stagg discounted accounts crediting any particular coach with being the innovator of the forward pass. stagg noted that he had walter eckersall working on pass plays and saw pomeroy sinnock of illinois throw many passes in 1906. stagg summed up his view as follows: "i have seen statements giving credit to certain people originating the forward pass. the fact is that all coaches were working on it. the first season, 1906, i personally had sixty-four different forward pass patterns." in 1954, stagg disputed cochems' claim to have invented the forward pass:"eddie cochems, who coached at st. louis university in 1906, also claimed to have invented the pass as we know it today ... it isn't so, because after the forward pass was legalized in 1906, most of the schools commenced experimenting with it and nearly all used."
stagg asserted that, as far back as 1894, before the rules committee even considered the forward pass, one of his players used to throw the ball "like a baseball pitcher."
on the other hand, hall of fame coach gus dorais told the united press that "eddie cochems of the st. louis university team of 1906–07–08 deserves the full credit." writing in "collier's" more than 20 years earlier, dorais' notre dame teammate knute rockne acknowledged cochems as the early leader in the use of the pass, observing, "one would have thought that so effective a play would have been instantly copied and become the vogue. the east, however, had not learned much or cared much about midwest and western football. indeed, the east scarcely realized that football existed beyond the alleghanies ..."
once the 1906 season got underway, many programs began experimenting with the forward pass. on september 26, 1906, villanova's game against the carlisle indians was billed as "the first real game of football under the new rules." in the first play from scrimmage after the opening kicks, villanova completed a pass that "succeeded in gaining ten yards." following the villanova-carlisle game, "the new york times" described the new passing game this way:"the passing was more of the character of that familiar in basket ball than that which has hitherto characterized football. apparently it is the intention of football coaches to try repeatedly these frequent long and risky passes. well executed they are undoubtedly highly spectacular, but the risk of dropping the ball is so great as to make the practice extremely hazardous and its desirability doubtful."
another coach sometimes credited with popularizing the overhead spiral pass in 1906 is former princeton all-american "bosey" reiter. reiter claimed to have invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player-coach for connie mack's philadelphia athletics of the original national football league (1902). while playing for the athletics, reiter was a teammate of hawley pierce, a former star for the carlisle indian school. pierce, a native american, taught reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but reiter had short arms and was unable to throw for distance from an underhand delivery. accordingly, reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass. reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base. after practice and experimentation, reiter "discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way." in 1906, reiter was the head coach at wesleyan university. in the opening game of the 1906 season against yale, reiter's quarterback sammy moore completed a forward pass to irvin van tassell for a thirty-yard gain. "the new york times" called it "the prettiest play of the day", as wesleyan's quarterback "deftly passed the ball past the whole yale team to his mate van tassel." van tassel later described the historic play to the united press:"i was the right halfback, and on this formation played one yard back of our right tackle. the quarterback, sam moore, took the ball from center and faded eight or 10 yards back of our line. our two ends angled down the field toward the sidelines as a decoy, and i slipped through the strong side of our line straight down the center and past the secondary defense. the pass worked perfectly. however, the quarterback coming up fast nailed me as i caught it. this brought the ball well into yale territory, about the 20-yard line."
the football season opened for most schools during the first week of october, and the impact of the forward pass was immediate:
some publications credit yale all-american paul veeder with the "first forward pass in a major game." veeder threw a 20 to 30-yard completion in leading yale past harvard 6–0 before 32,000 fans in new haven on november 24, 1906. however, that yale/harvard game was played three weeks after st. louis completed 45 and 48-yard passes against kansas before a crowd of 7,000 at sportsman's park.
the forward pass was a central feature of cochems' offensive scheme in 1906 as his st. louis university team compiled an undefeated 11–0 season in which they outscored opponents by a combined score 407 to 11. the highlight of the campaign was st. louis' 39–0 win over iowa. cochems' team reportedly completed eight passes in ten attempts for four touchdowns. "the average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards." nelson continues, "the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. st. louis was on iowa's thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. timekeeper walter mccormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown."
the 1906 iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country, west point's lt. horatio b. "stuffy" hackett. he had officiated games involving the top eastern powers that year. hackett, who would become a member of the football rules committee in december 1907 and officiated games into the 1930s, was quoted the next day in ed wray's "globe-democrat" article: "it was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that i have seen all season and much better than that of yale and harvard. st. louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... the st. louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... the fast throw by st. louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect."
hackett is the only known expert witness to the passing offenses of both cochems' 1906 squads and that of stagg, who dismissed any special role for the st. louis coach in the development of the pass. hackett was an official in games involving both teams. as wray recalled almost 40 years later: "hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by st. louis u. nor such bewildering variations of it."
"cochems said that the poor iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass", nelson writes. "iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes."
"during the 1906 season [robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes."
in 1907, after the first season of the forward pass, one football writer noted that, "with the single exception of cochems, football teachers were groping in the dark."
because st. louis was geographically isolated from both the dominating teams and the major sports media (newspapers) of the era ... all centered in and focused on the east ... cochems' groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams. pass-oriented offenses would not be adopted by the eastern football powers until the next decade.
but that does not mean that other teams in the midwest did not pick it up. arthur schabinger, quarterback for the college of emporia in kansas, was reported to have regularly used the forward pass in 1910. coach h. w. "bill" hargiss' "presbies" are said to have featured the play in a 17–0 victory over washburn university and in a 107–0 destruction of pittsburg state university. coach pop warner at carlisle had quarterback frank mount pleasant, one of the first regular spiral pass quarterbacks in football.
knute rockne and gus dorais worked on the pass while lifeguarding on a lake erie beach at cedar point in sandusky, ohio, during the summer of 1913. that year, jesse harper, notre dame head coach, also showed how the pass could be used by a smaller team to beat a bigger one, first utilizing it to defeat rival army. after it was used against a major school on a national stage in this game, the forward pass rapidly gained popularity.
the 1919 and 1920 notre dame teams had george gipp, an ideal handler of the forward pass, who threw for 1,789 yards.
john mohardt led the 1921 notre dame team to a 10-1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. grantland rice wrote that "mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space" and noted that the 1921 team was the first at notre dame "to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game." mohardt had both eddie anderson and roger kiley at end to receive his passes.
from 1915–1916, pudge wyman and end bert baston of minnesota were "one of the greatest forward-passing combinations in the history of the gridiron."
in the 1921 rose bowl, california's brick muller completed a touchdown against washington & jefferson which went 53 yards in the air, a feat previously thought impossible.
in a 1925, 62–13 victory over cornell, dartmouth's andy oberlander had 477 yards in total offense, including six touchdown passes, a dartmouth record which still stands.
the 1925 michigan team was coach fielding h. yost's favorite and featured the passing tandem of benny friedman and bennie oosterbaan.
yost disciple dan mcgugin coached vanderbilt and was one of the first emphasize the forward pass. his 1907 team beat sewanee on a double pass play grantland rice cited as his biggest thrill in his years of watching sports. mcgugin's 1927 team was piloted by bill spears, who threw for over a thousand yards. according to one writer, vanderbilt produced "almost certainly the legit top heisman candidate in spears, if there had been a heisman trophy to award in 1927." mcgugin disciple and former quarterback ray morrison brought the pass to the southwest when he coached gerald mann at southern methodist.
the first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown in an ohio league game played on october 25, 1906. the ohio league, which traced its history to the 1890s, was a direct predecessor of today's nfl. according to robert w. peterson in his book "pigskin the early years of pro football", the "passer was george w. (peggy) parratt, probably the best quarterback of the era", who played for the massillon, ohio tigers, one of pro football's first franchises. citing the professional football researchers association as his source, peterson writes that "parratt completed a short pass to end dan riley (real name, dan policowski)" in a game played at massillon against a team from west virginia. since the tigers "ran up a 61 to 0 score on the hapless mountain staters, the pass played no important part in the result."
according to national football league history, it legalized the forward pass from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage on february 25, 1933. before that rule change, a forward pass had to be made from 5 or more yards behind the line of scrimmage.
forward passes were first permitted in canadian football in 1929, but the tactic remained a minor part of the game for several years. jack jacobs of the winnipeg blue bombers is recognized, not for inventing the forward pass, but for popularizing it in the western interprovincial football union (one of the forerunner leagues to the modern canadian football league) in the early 1950s, thus changing the canadian game from a more run-dominated game to the passing game as seen today.
specification of the size of the ball for the american game came in 1912, but it was still essentially a rugby ball. increased use of the forward pass encouraged adoption of a narrower ball, starting with changes in the 1920s which enhanced rifled throwing and also spiral punting. this had the consequence of all but eliminating the drop kick from the american game.
in the two codes of rugby (union and league), a forward pass is against the rules. normally this results in a scrum to the opposing team, but on rare occasions a penalty may be awarded if the referee is of the belief that the ball was deliberately thrown forward.
in both codes of rugby the direction of the pass is relative to the player making the pass and not to the actual path relative to the ground. a forward pass occurs when the player passes the ball forward in relation to himself. (this applies only to the movement of the player, not to the direction in which he or she is facing, i.e. if the player is facing backwards and passes in front of him, it is not forward; and conversely, if he passes behind him, it is forward as he is passing toward the opponent's goal area.) in rugby league, the video referee may not make judgements on whether a pass is forward.
the garryowen, as well as the cross-field kick, while not as reliable as the forward pass and more difficult to execute successfully, can provide some of the function that a forward pass does in american and canadian football.

telecommunications in fiji include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the internet.
radio is a key source of information, particularly on the outer islands. there are publicly and privately owned stations. state-owned fiji broadcasting corporation operates fijian-language radio fiji one, hindi-language radio fiji two, music-based bula fm, hindi station mirchi fm, and music-based 2day fm.
communications fiji limited, a public listed company on the south pacific stock exchange was established in 1996 and is located in 231 waimanu road, suva. it broadcasts english speaking stations fm96 and legendfm on 96.2fm and 98.6fm respectively, fijian language station, vitifm, navtarang and radio sargam - hindi speaking stations. the bbc world service broadcasts on 88.2 fm in the capital, suva.
under the military government's media decree, the directors and 90 percent of the shareholders of locally based media must be citizens of, and permanently resident in, the country. the fiji media industry development authority is responsible for enforcing these provisions. the authority has the power to investigate journalists and media outlets for alleged violations of the decree, including powers of search and seizure of equipment.
a code of ethics contained in the media decree requires that all stories run by the media be balanced, with comment obtained from both sides where there is any disagreement on the facts. this requirement enables government departments and private businesses to prevent stories from being published by not responding to media questions, thus making it impossible for the media to fulfill the decree's requirement for comment from both sides. however, media sources report that if the story is positive toward the government, the balance requirement could be ignored without consequence.
the internet is widely available and used in and around urban centers, but its availability and use are minimal or nonexistent outside these areas.
the government in a parliament sitting on march 15, 2018 passed a bill known as the online safety bill to the standing committee on justice, law and human rights that was tabled in the parliament of fiji to enforce tougher restrictions on those that may share explicit photos of individuals on social media or spread anti- government remarks as well.
currently, there are no government restrictions on general public access to the internet, but evidence suggests that the government monitors private e-mails of citizens as well as internet traffic in an attempt to control antigovernment reports by anonymous bloggers.
the country has operated under a military-led government since 2006 and has had no constitution or functioning parliament since 2009. a series of decrees have been issued, including the public order amendment decree (poad), the media decree, and the crime decree.
by decree all telephone and internet service users must register their personal details with telephone and internet providers, including their name, birth date, home address, left thumbprint, and photographic identification. the decree imposes fines of up to f$100,000 ($56,721) on providers who continue to provide services to unregistered users and up to f$10,000 ($5,672) on users who do not update their registration information as required. vodafone, one of two mobile telephone providers, also requires users to register their nationality, postal address, employment details, and both thumbprints.
the poad gives the government the power to detain persons on suspicion of "endangering public safety or the preservation of the peace"; defines terrorism as any act designed to advance a political, religious, or ideological cause that could "reasonably be regarded" as intended to compel a government to do or refrain from doing any act or to intimidate the public or a section thereof; and makes religious vilification and attempts to sabotage or undermine the economy offenses punishable by a maximum f$10,000 ($5,672) fine or five years’ imprisonment. the media decree prohibits "irresponsible reporting" and provides for government censorship of the media. the crimes decree includes criticism of the government in its definition of the crime of sedition, including statements made in other countries by any person, who can be prosecuted on return to fiji. the government uses the threat of prosecution under these provisions to intimidate government critics and limit public criticism of the government. journalists and media organizations practice varying degrees of self-censorship, with many reportedly fearing retribution if they criticize the government.
in may 2007 it was reported that the military in fiji had blocked access to blogs critical of the regime.
in 2012 police investigated former university of the south pacific (usp) professor wadan narsey, a prominent fijian economist and long-time critic of the military government, for alleged sedition in writings published on his personal blog.
the poad permits military personnel to search persons and premises without a warrant from a court and to take photographs, fingerprints, and measurements of any person. police and military officers may enter private premises to break up any meeting considered unlawful.

the republic of fiji military forces (rfmf) is the military force of the pacific island nation of fiji. with a total manpower of 3,500 active soldiers and 6,000 reservists, it is one of the smallest militaries in the world, though most of its surrounding island nations have no militaries at all. the ground force is organised into six infantry and one engineer battalions, with approximately 6,000 reserves. there was formerly one "zulu" company of counter-revolutionary specialists, which was deactivated in late 2000 due to a mutiny by some of its members.
the first two regular battalions of the fiji infantry regiment are traditionally stationed overseas on peacekeeping duties; the 1st battalion has been posted to lebanon, iraq, syria, and east timor under the command of the un, while the 2nd battalion is stationed in sinai with the mfo. peacekeepers income represents an important source of income for fiji. the 3rd battalion is stationed in the capital, suva, and the remaining three are spread throughout the islands.
the 300-man navy unit rfmf celebrated, on 25 july 2015, the fortieth anniversary of its founding. it was formed in 1975 (naval squadron royal fiji military forces), following the government's ratification of the united nations law of the sea convention. the navy is responsible for maritime needs in border control, such as watching over fiji's exclusive economic zone and organising task and rescue missions. it currently operates 9 patrol boats. military aid is received from australia, the people's republic of china, and the united kingdom (although the latter has suspended aid as a result of the 2006 military coup against the civilian government).
speaking at 30th anniversary celebrations on 26 july 2006, commander bradley bower said that the greatest challenge facing the navy of a maritime country like fiji was to maintain sovereignty and the maritime environment, to acquire, restore, and replace equipment, and to train officers to keep pace with changing situations.
in january 2019 five of fiji's naval vessels were operational. in 2020 australia will provide two new s to replace the three vessels it provided over thirty years ago.
3 x (australia, displacement 162 t, length , width draught , power 2 x , maximal speed , crew 17-man, armament machine guns 1 x 12.7 mm). these boats replaced discharged s fns "kula", "kikau" and "kiro", gained 1975 – 1976 from the united states navy.
2 patrol boat (us, displacement 97 t, crew 11-man, armament machine guns 1 x 12.7 mm)
4 (israel, displacement 39 t, crew 9-man, armament 2 x cannon 20 mm, 2 x machine guns 7.62 mm)
the air wing of the republic of fiji military forces, founded in 1987, had a base at the airport in nausori, but was abolished in 1997. yehonatan shimʻon frenḳel writes that the "air wing was formed after the 1987 coup, when the french provided two helicopters as part of its military aid package." frenkel goes on to say that the air wing was disbanded after both helicopters crashed and after subsequent revelations of huge debts incurred as a result of the aircraft.
the two helicopters were:
helicopter as-365 n2 dauphin crashed off the coast of the main island in july 1994; a smaller as-355f-2 continued in service until mid-1997 and in 1999 was sold to france.
the air wing did not have its own roundel or ensign and its only marking was the national flag used as a fin flash.
a boeing 707-339 was reportedly used by the fiji un ambassadors, it operated in pakistan international airlines markings with royal fiji military forces titles near the front passenger door.
rank designation based on the british tradition.
fiji's military has a history of political intervention. in 1987, soldiers were responsible for two military coups, and in 2000, the military organised a countercoup to quash george speight's civilian coup. since 2000, the military has had a sometimes tense relationship with the qarase government, and has strongly opposed its plans to establish a commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup. among other objections, the military claims that its integrity and discipline would be undermined if soldiers who mutinied in the 2000 upheaval were to be pardoned.
on 4 august 2005, opposition leader mahendra chaudhry called for more indo-fijians, who presently comprise less than one percent of the military personnel, to be recruited. (specifically, as of october 2007, fiji's military had 3527 full-time members, of whom only 15 were indo-fijians.) this would help guarantee political stability, he considered. he also spoke against government plans to downsize the military. military spokesman lieutenant colonel orisi rabukawaqa responded the next day by saying that the military was not an ethnic fijian body, that it stood to serve the entire nation, and that there was no colour bar in its recruitment or promotion. he said that many indo-fijians had been reluctant to commit themselves to a military career because of the slow progress of promotion, often preferring to be discharged and to use their record as a stepping stone to a successful career in some other field. nevertheless, he appreciated the indo-fijian contribution to the military, and noted the success of lieutenant colonel mohammed aziz, the head of the military's legal unit who was a pivotal figure in the court martial of soldiers who mutinied in 2000. ironically the rate of promotion of indigenous fijian officers had been very rapid after the 1987 coup, and subsequent expansion of the republic of fiji military forces.
on 26 august 2005, the government announced plans to study ways to reduce the size of the military. military engineers would be transferred to the regional development ministry, said home affair minister josefa vosanibola, and the reduction of the military forces would coincide with an increase in the numbers of the police force.
on 26 september 2005, rabukawaqa revealed that the military had decided to curtail certain operations to stay within its budget. the cuts would affect maritime patrols, search and rescue operations, training and exercises, school cadet training, and the deployment of military engineers to rural areas. these cuts would be made to ensure that activities accorded a higher priority, such as peacekeeping operations in the sinai peninsula and iraq, officer cadet training with the new zealand defence forces, and the prosecution of soldiers charged with mutiny, would not be affected, rabukawaqa said.
the next day, lesi korovavala, chief executive officer of the ministry of home affairs, told the fiji village news service that the military had undertaken the reductions on its own initiative, in consultation with the department, an explanation corroborated by lieutenant colonel rabukawaqa.
on 5 december 2006, the fijian army staged a third coup d'état. on 7 february 2008, the head of the rfmf and post-coup interim prime minister voreqe bainimarama stated: "qarase [...] does not understand the role of the military and as such is misinforming the nation. [...] [i]f there are practices and policies which have potential to undermine the national security and territorial integrity of fiji, the rfmf has every right under the constitution to intervene." in august 2009, with bainimarama still controlling the government as prime minister and the constitution abrogated, ratu epeli nailatikau, a former military commander, was appointed acting president on the retirement of iloilo.
the military of fiji has always had a close relationship to fiji's churches, particularly the methodist church, to which some two-thirds of indigenous fijians belong.

fiji has experienced many coups recently, in 1987, 2000, and 2006. fiji has been suspended various times from the commonwealth of nations, a grouping of mostly former british colonies. it was readmitted to the commonwealth in december 2001, following the parliamentary election held to restore democracy in september that year, and has been suspended again because of the 2006 coup, but has been readmitted a second time after the 2014 election. other pacific island governments have generally been sympathetic to fiji's internal political problems and have declined to take public positions.
fiji became the 127th member of the united nations on 13 october 1970, and participates actively in the organization. fiji's contributions to un peacekeeping are unique for a nation of its size. a nation with a population of less than one million, it maintains nearly 1,000 soldiers overseas in un peacekeeping missions, mainly in the middle east.
since fiji's independence, the country has been a leader in the south pacific region, and has played a leading role in the formation of the south pacific forum. fiji has championed causes of common interest to pacific island countries.
since 2005, fiji has become embroiled in a number of disagreements with other countries, including australia, china, new zealand, south korea, the united states, and vanuatu.
the country's foreign relations and diplomatic missions are maintained by its ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation.
list of countries which have established diplomatic relations with fiji:
fiji maintains direct diplomatic or consular relations with countries with historical, cultural, or trading ties to fiji; ambassadors stationed in such countries are often accredited to neighbouring countries. fiji maintains embassies in belgium (taking care of fiji's relations with the entire european union), china, japan, south korea, and the united states; and high commissions in australia, india, malaysia, papua new guinea, the united kingdom and new zealand (in keeping with the commonwealth practice of calling missions in fellow-commonwealth countries high commissions rather than embassies). fiji also has a permanent mission to the united nations.
australia and new zealand have both expressed concern over legislation currently before the fijian parliament (as of june 2005), which proposes to establish a reconciliation and unity commission, with the power (subject to presidential approval) to compensate victims and pardon persons convicted of crimes related to the coup d'état which deposed the elected government in 2000.
on 30 august 2005, the then commonwealth secretary-general don mckinnon called on the fijian government to ensure that the legislation reflected the views of its citizens. he emphasized, however, that the commonwealth did not have a position on the bill.
fiji plays an active role in numerous international bodies. the south pacific forum was largely the brainchild of ratu sir kamisese mara, fiji's first prime minister. the country has been an outspoken participant many international forums.
fiji has been a member of the commonwealth of nations since it gained its independence in 1970. it was not a member of the commonwealth between 1987 and 1997 as a result of a republican coup d'état, and was suspended just three years after rejoining between 2000 and 2001 after a military coup, and was suspended after the 2006 coup.
fiji regained its full status as a commonwealth republic after the fijian general election in 2014.
on 1 september 2005, it was announced that the oceania customs organization would relocate to fiji in 2006. though located in fiji, it would be totally independent of the fijian government and of the fiji islands revenue and customs authority (firca), finance minister ratu jone kubuabola said, and for the first three years of its presence in fiji, its secretariat would be financed by the new zealand government.
speaking at the 18th fiji-australia business forum in sydney on 17 october 2005, prime minister qarase strongly criticized the world trade organization, saying that its policies were unfair to small countries like fiji. ""wto is trying to impose equality of trade in an unequal world,"" he said, ""but for developing countries like fiji there is no level playing field, just a slippery slope."" it would be a long time before fiji's economy could compete on equal terms with that of more developed nations, he considered.
on 10 january 2006, the fijian government criticized the international labour organization for what it said was the organization's unfair treatment of the fiji islands congress of trade unions (fictu). labour minister kenneth zinck said the government had received a complaint from fictu about the ilo's discrimination against it in favour of the rival fiji trades union congress.
speaking at the 6th session of the permanent forum on indigenous issues in new york city on 23 may 2005, isikia savua, fiji's permanent representative (ambassador) to the united nations, called for equal recognition of individual and collective rights in national and international policies. he said that fiji had embodied both concepts in its constitution, through such provisions as communal voting (giving each elector to vote for two members of the house of representatives, one from his or her own ethnic group, and the other from any ethnic group).
on 1 september 2005, prime minister qarase announced his intention to ask his australian counterpart, john howard, for more favourable market access for pacific island products. he called on australia and new zealand to revise the rules of origin under the sparteca trade agreement, and reduce the figure from 50 percent to 35 percent, thereby allowing fiji to export a higher percentage of garments made elsewhere to australian and new zealand markets.
on 28 october 2005, prime minister qarase criticized australia and new zealand for refusing to grant temporary work permits to pacific islanders. he said the two countries were acting unfairly in assuming that such permits would encourage illegal immigration. the prime minister claimed that in the absence of such work permits, pacific islanders visiting australia and new zealand often undertook illegal employment anyway.

the goal line is the chalked or painted line dividing the end zone from the field of play in american football and canadian football. it is the line that must be crossed in order to score a touchdown.
if any part of the ball reaches any part of the imaginary vertical plane transected by this line while in-bounds and in possession of a player whose team is striving toward that end of the field, this is considered a touchdown and scores six points for the team whose player has advanced the ball to, or recovered the ball in, this position. this is in contrast with other sports like association football and ice hockey, which require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score.
if any member of the offensive team is downed while in possession of the ball behind his own team's goal line, this is called a safety and scores two points for the defensive team.
if, during the course of play, a loose ball travels past the goal line and is recovered within the end zone, then it is a touchdown if recovered by the team that scores in that end zone, or a touchback if recovered and downed by the opposing team
in the event of a kick recovered in one's own end zone, the entirety of the ball must pass the goal line in order for the ball to be considered a touchback, and to not be in the field of play.

most forms of football have a move known as a tackle. the primary and important purposes of tackling are to dispossess an opponent of the ball, to stop the player from gaining ground towards goal or to stop them from carrying out what they intend.
the word is used in some contact variations of football to describe the act of physically holding or wrestling a player to the ground. in others, it simply describes one or more methods of contesting for possession of the ball. it can therefore be used as both a defensive or attacking move.
in middle dutch, the verb meant to grab or to handle. by the 14th century, this had come to be used for the equipment used for fishing, referring to the rod and reel, etc., and also for that used in sailing, referring to rigging, equipment, or gear used on ships. by the 18th century, a similar use was applied to harnesses or equipment used with horses. modern use in football comes from the earlier sport of rugby, where the word was used in the 19th century.
in american football and canadian football, to tackle is to physically interfere with the forward progress of a player in possession of the ball, such that his forward progress ceases and is not resumed, or such that he is caused to touch some part of his body to the ground other than his feet or hands, or such that he is forced to go out of bounds. in any such case, the ball becomes dead, the down is over, and play ceases until the beginning of the next play.
a tackle is known as a quarterback sack when the quarterback is tackled at or behind the line of scrimmage while attempting to throw a pass. a tackle for loss indicates a tackle that causes a loss of yardage for the opposing running back or wide receiver. this happens when the quarterback is sacked, when either a rusher or a receiver is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, or when the ball is fumbled behind the line of scrimmage and was picked up by an offensive player who does not manage to move past the line before being tackled. when a player who does not have the ball is taken down, it is generally referred to as a block.
tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often "tackled" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground. tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey (or even hair, should it be long enough and allowed to dangle freely from beneath the helmet) and pulling him to the ground. as mentioned above, the referee can declare that a play is dead if the ball carrier's forward progress has been stopped, even if he has not actually been taken to the ground.
to protect players from potentially catastrophic injury, there are some restrictions on tackles and blocks. at no time may a defensive player tackle an offensive player by grabbing the facemask of their helmet; doing so incurs a 15-yard penalty and the victimized team is awarded a new set of downs. although spear tackles are allowed in gridiron football, a player may not use his helmet to tackle an opponent as the technique can cause serious injury to both players (more often the tackler, due to the force of reaction on the tackler, which is apt to be beyond the limit that the neck can handle) and also warrants a 15-yard penalty as well as a fresh set of downs if committed by the defending team; this is known as "spearing the player". a similar penalty is assessed to any player attempting to make contact with his helmet against another opponent's helmet, which is known as a helmet-to-helmet collision. grabbing a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck and pulling him down is known as a "horse collar", a method which has been made illegal at all levels of american football.
it is also illegal to tackle a player who has thrown a forward pass (generally a quarterback) after he has released the ball; doing so is called "roughing the passer" and incurs a 15-yard penalty and a fresh set of downs for the team with the ball. however, in the nfl a player can continue forward for one step, which means that often a player who is committed to attacking the quarterback will still make a tackle. place kickers and punters are afforded an even greater protection from being tackled.
once the play is ruled complete, no contact is permitted; a player who makes contact with an opponent after the play is charged with "unnecessary roughness" and his team is assessed a 15-yard penalty.
blocks that occur in the back of the legs and below the knees, initiated below the waist, or clotheslines are also generally prohibited and players who use them are subject to much more severe penalties than other illegal tackles. however, a player who plays on the line "can" block below the knees (cut block) as long the block is within five yards of the line and the player they block is in front of them and not engaged by another blocker (chop block).
in the national football league (nfl), tackles are tracked as an unofficial statistic by a scorekeeper hired by the home team. though the statistic is widely cited, the league does not verify that the counts are accurate.
unlike other codes, tackles in association football have to be predominantly directed against the ball rather than the player in possession of it. this is achieved by using either leg to wrest possession from the opponent, or sliding in on the grass to knock the ball away. a defender is permitted to use their body to obstruct the motion of a player with the ball, and this may be part of a successful tackle. pulling a player to the ground in the style of tackle common to other codes is completely absent from the game (this would be considered "serious foul play" and result a dismissal).
although some contact between players is allowed, the rules of association football significantly limit the physicality of tackles, explicitly forbidding contacts which are "careless, reckless or [use] excessive force". almost all tackles where the tackler's legs make contact with the opponent before the ball are considered illegal, and heavy contact after initially touching the ball may also be penalised.
illegal tackles are fouls and are punished with a direct free kick (or penalty if committed within the penalty area) for the opponent's team. such incidents are common, with dozens of occurrences in a typical match. in most cases these fouls are not considered misconducts, however yellow cards (cautions) may be delivered for more egregious fouls that constitute "unsporting behaviour". if a foul tackle endangers the tackled player's safety, it is likely to be considered as "violent conduct" by the referee and punished with a red card (dismissal).
tackles that involve lunging at an opponent with both legs, regardless of whether the ball is won, are generally considered to constitute serious foul play and hence result in a sending-off. this explicitly includes "scissoring" (tackling with legs apart, so as to trap the opponent's leg or legs in between), which is likely to be punished with a send-off (red card), as it poses a high risk of severe knee injury to the player being tackled. tackling with "studs up" is considered dangerous. a "studs up tackle" is made when a player lunges into a tackle with a leg or both legs outstretched exposing the soles of their boots. referees are encouraged to at the very least caution (yellow card) players who commit such challenges.
additionally, an illegal tackle which is also a professional foul is considered misconduct.
the most spectacular form of tackle in association football is the slide tackle, wherein a tackler slides, leg extended, along the ground, aiming to hit the ball away. this form of tackle carries a high risk of committing a foul.
"diving" is association football involves tackled players exaggerating the physicality of tackles, so as to gain favourable decisions from the referee.
in australian rules football, the move commonly described as a "tackle" is similar to in rugby and involves wrapping, holding or wrestling a player who has possession of the ball to the ground. players not in possession of the ball are not allowed to be tackled, and will receive a holding the man free kick if tackled.
as there is no offside rule in australian rules football, players can be tackled from any direction, and are often blindsided. for this reason, the sport allows players to shepherd and bump their opponents within 5 metres of the ball, to protect the ball carrier.
a tackled player must immediately dispose of the ball legally, by kicking or handballing, but not by throwing or dropping the ball. if this is not done, a holding the ball free kick will be awarded to the tackler. if the ball is knocked free by the tackler, pinned to the player by the tackler, or the player unsuccessfully attempts a kick or handball, a free kick will only be awarded if the ball carrier is deemed to have had a prior opportunity to dispose of the ball prior to being tackled. if a player has not had prior opportunity to dispose of the ball and a tackler knocks the ball free during a tackle then no free kick is paid and the game continues.
a tackle must only contact below the shoulders and above the knees, and a player is able to be thrown to the ground, so long as the tackle is deemed not to be reckless or likely to cause injury. there are also rules outlawing pushing in the back making tackling more difficult. tripping, by both hand or foot, is not allowed and can be a reportable offence.
players wear little to no padding to cushion the impact of tackles, however players generally wear mouthguards to protect their teeth.
there are many types of tackles in australian rules football:
although the term "tackle" is used in australian rules to exclusively describe wrapping, holding or wrestling a player in possession, there are also several other ways of contesting possession in australian rules that other sports would describe as a "tackle" and that also involve a degree of contact.
other defensive actions are generally categorised as "one percenters". the defensive tactic of punching away (commonly known as spoiling) from a player is allowed. "smothering", which involves using the arms or body to get in the way of an opponent's kick as it leaves their boot, and is similar to a "charge down" in rugby football.
gaelic football defines tackling as wresting the ball from an opponent's hands. bumping is allowed on the player with the ball, but a player cannot be grabbed.
international rules football is a hybrid game between australian rules football and gaelic football.
tackling in international rules is subject to similar rules as australian rules football, but with some subtle differences. tackling is only allowed as low as the waist, whereas it is allowed down to the knees in aussie rules. one handed tackling has been banned in international rules since the 2008 international rules series.
in rugby league the ball-carrier can be tackled by any number of defenders from any direction. the initial contact in the tackle must be made below the ball carrier's neck or it will be deemed a high tackle and penalised. a tackle in rugby league is completed when any of the following occurs:
once the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to 'play-the-ball' and the defensive team must retreat 10 metres (except 2 markers, facing the tackled player). spear tackles are illegal in rugby league, with most tackles in which the defender is lifted 'above the horizontal' bringing about penalties in the modern game. a stiff arm tackle is an offence. a 2012 new zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league. of all the rugby league positions, second-row forward averages the most tackles.
in rugby union, a player must be brought to ground for a tackle to be completed. the tackled player must release the ball, but the ball is not dead and a "ruck" forms to contest possession of it. if the ball carrier is not brought to the ground a "maul" will usually form. high/reckless or stiff arm tackles laws once dictated any contact made above the shoulders was an offence. now, even if contact starts below the shoulders, if the head is involved in any reckless tackle it results in the offending player being given a yellow card and therefore sin binned. world rugby now defines a reckless tackle as being any contact where the tackler "knew or should have known that there was a risk of making contact with the head of an opponent, but did so anyway"
for various codes of football, variant codes have been developed which substitute out the tackling element, making the game less physical. in these games, either a being touched by an opponent or, in some codes, having a tag on the player's person removed, has effects similar to a tackle in the parent code.
other non-football games that feature tackling or similar concepts include british bulldogs, hurling, hockey and shinty.
some illegal tackle moves result in a penalty play, however others may be "reportable" offences — that is, the option exists for an official to penalise a player's conduct individually rather than during the game refer it to a tribunal for deferred penalty.

a play from scrimmage is the activity of the games of canadian football and american football during which one team tries to advance the ball, get a first down, or to score, and the other team tries to stop them or take the ball away. once a play is over, and before the next play starts, the football is considered dead. a game of american football (or canadian football) consists of many (about 120-150) such plays.
the term is also used to denote a specific plan of action, or its execution, under a particular set of circumstances faced by either team. for instance, the offensive team may be faced with one or two downs left in a possession and still ten or more yards to go to earn a new set of downs. in this instance, they may decide to employ a forward pass. well in advance of the particular game, a number of different kinds of forward pass plays will have been planned out and practiced by the team. they will be designated by obscure words, letters and/or numbers so that the name of a play does not reveal its exact execution to outsiders. the team's coach, or perhaps the quarterback, will choose one of the planned forward passing strategies, and tell the team, during the huddle which one has been chosen. because of planning and practice, each player is expected to know what his role in the play is to be, and how to execute it. this will be the offensive play.
conversely, the defensive team will know that the offense has to cover a good deal of ground in a single play, will expect a forward pass, and will know from earlier study something of the propensities of the offense they face. the defensive captain is likely to call out a specific formation or defensive play, to anticipate and counteract the expected action by the offense.
the play will begin with the snap of the ball (typically but not exclusively to the quarterback), and it will end when the effort by the offensive squad to advance the ball has either succeeded in scoring, or has been frustrated by the ball being downed before the aim of the offensive play is accomplished, or by the defensive squad having managed to come into possession of the ball without first downing it. in the event of change of possession during a play, the team newly in possession of the ball may try to advance it toward their opponent's goal, which the team formerly in possession will naturally resist. change of possession during a routine play may occur by interception or by fumble (often collectively referred to as "turnovers").
change of possession may also occur in other ways. a change of possession can occur "on downs", if the offensive team fails to achieve a first down or a touchdown in a specified number of consecutive attempts, known as "downs" (four in american football; three in canadian football). another way is through a change of possession play, when the offensive team (having perhaps surmised the unlikelihood of scoring or of achieving a first down within the allowed consecutive attempts to do so) kicks the ball away in what is known as a punt. a touchdown (and subsequent conversion attempt, whether successful or not) or successful field goal attempt will be followed by a kickoff. kickoffs and field goal attempts are not considered true change of possession plays. an unsuccessful field goal attempt will usually also result in a change of possession (without a kickoff), but is usually not counted as a turnover.

a football player or footballer is a sport person who plays one of the different types of football. the main types of football are association football, american football, canadian football, australian rules football, gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union.
it has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world, and many play the other forms of football.
jean-pierre papin has described football as a "universal language". footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.
footballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.
wages in some top men's leagues are significantly higher than other jobs. players in the premier league earn average wages of about $1 million per year. in the wealthiest clubs in european football leagues, some players earn an average wage up to $6 to $8 million per year. the best players of those clubs can earn up to $70 million per year.
however, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. wages may be much more moderate in other divisions and leagues, and a significant number of players are semi-professional. for example, the average annual salary for footballers in major league soccer (which started in 2009) for the 2013 season was $148,693, with significant variations depending on player position (goalkeepers for example earned $85,296, whereas forwards earned $251,805).
popularity and average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. for example, players in the national women's soccer league (nwsl) (which started in 2012) earn $15,000 to $40,000 per year as of january 2017.
a minority of retired footballers continue working full-time within football, for instance as football managers. a 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second teamers and reserves. however, some experience chronic health issues, see below.
research shows that association football players that take less than 200ms after the referee blows their whistle for a penalty kick are significantly more likely to miss scoring than those that take over a second.
an irish 2002 study of association and gaelic football players characterised players as "lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance". the opposite is the case for american football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems.
a 2000 study documented injuries sustained by czech [association] football players at all levels:
patellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an overused injury that also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. it is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. the chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain.
although levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average, some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. head injuries are a particular concern.
the average life expectancy or lifespan of an american football nfl player has been reported to be extremely low, only 53 to 59 years depending on playing position. however, a 2012 study reported that retired nfl players have a lower death rate than men in the general population. an oft-cited life expectancy of 58 years has been claimed by "sports illustrated" to be based on a myth. according to a 2007 study, which also claims that little supporting data is available, retired american football players had "long and fulfilling careers with no apparent long-term detrimental effects on physical or mental health scores despite a high prevalence of arthritis". one explanation is that "life expectancy" is ambiguous: it may in some contexts refer to the expected age of death of a player, and in other contexts to the expected remaining number of life years.
as for association football, a 2011 german study found that german national team players live 1.9 years less than the general male population.
a 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of all blacks is the same as for the general population.
american football players are prone to head injuries such as concussion. in later life, this increases the risk of dementia and alzheimer's.
professional american football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions.
probably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. in a 1987 study of former norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, "i.e." brain damage. a 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (cthi):
anterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles.
an increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players.
a 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles.
in a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players.
the rate of suicide among nfl vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population.
in 2012, fifa released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players.

friedrich wilhelm nietzsche (, ; 15 october 1844 – 25 august 1900) was a german philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and latin and greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. he began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. he became the youngest ever to hold the chair of classical philology at the university of basel in 1869 at the age of 24. nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. in 1889 at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward, a complete loss of his mental faculties. he lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister elisabeth förster-nietzsche. nietzsche died in 1900.
nietzsche's body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science. his writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. his early inspiration was drawn from figures such as arthur schopenhauer, richard wagner, and johann wolfgang von goethe. prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and christian morality and his related theory of master–slave morality; his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the "death of god" and the profound crisis of nihilism; his notion of the apollonian and dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. he also developed influential concepts such as the "" and the doctrine of eternal return. in his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.
after his death, his sister elisabeth became the curator and editor of nietzsche's manuscripts, reworking his unpublished writings to fit her own german nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. through her published editions, nietzsche's work became associated with fascism and nazism; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism and post-structuralism—as well as art, literature, psychology, politics and popular culture.
born on 15 october 1844, nietzsche grew up in the small town of röcken (now part of lützen), near leipzig, in the prussian province of saxony. he was named after king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia, who turned 49 on the day of nietzsche's birth (nietzsche later dropped his middle name wilhelm). nietzsche's parents, carl ludwig nietzsche (1813–1849), a lutheran pastor and former teacher; and ("née" oehler) (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. they had two other children: a daughter, elisabeth förster-nietzsche, born in 1846; and a second son, ludwig joseph, born in 1848. nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; ludwig joseph died six months later at age two. the family then moved to naumburg, where they lived with nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. after the death of nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now nietzsche-haus, a museum and nietzsche study centre.
nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with gustav krug, rudolf wagner and wilhelm pinder, all of whom came from highly respected families.
in 1854, he began to attend domgymnasium in naumburg. because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized schulpforta (the claim that nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were nowhere near the top of the class). he transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with paul deussen and carl von gersdorff. he also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. nietzsche led "germania", a music and literature club, during his summers in naumburg. at schulpforta, nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—greek, latin, hebrew, and french—so as to be able to read important primary sources; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. his end-of-semester exams in march 1864 showed a 1 in religion and german; a 2a in greek and latin; a 2b in french, history, and physics; and a "lackluster" 3 in hebrew and mathematics.
while at pforta, nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming. he became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet friedrich hölderlin, calling him "my favorite poet" and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to "the most sublime ideality." the teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more "german" writers. additionally, he became acquainted with ernst ortlepp, an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young nietzsche but who may have introduced nietzsche to the music and writing of richard wagner. perhaps under ortlepp's influence, he and a student named richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a prefect.
after graduation in september 1864, nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the university of bonn with hope of becoming a minister. for a short time he and deussen became members of the burschenschaft "frankonia". after one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith. as early as his 1862 essay "fate and history", nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of christianity, but david strauss's "life of jesus" also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man. in addition, ludwig feuerbach's "the essence of christianity" influenced young nietzsche with its argument that people created god, and not the other way around. in june 1865, at the age of 20, nietzsche wrote to his sister elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. this letter contains the following statement:
hence the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire...
nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under professor friedrich wilhelm ritschl, whom he followed to the university of leipzig in 1865. there, he became close friends with his fellow student erwin rohde. nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.
in 1865, nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of arthur schopenhauer. he owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading schopenhauer's "the world as will and representation" and later admitted that schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay "" in the "untimely meditations" to him.
in 1866, he read friedrich albert lange's "history of materialism". lange's descriptions of kant's anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of european materialism, europe's increased concern with science, charles darwin's theory of evolution, and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued nietzsche greatly. nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.
in 1867, nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the prussian artillery division in naumburg. he was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. however, in march 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, nietzsche struck his chest against the pommel and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months. consequently, nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with richard wagner for the first time later that year.
in part because of ritschl's support, nietzsche received a remarkable offer in 1869 to become professor of classical philology at the university of basel in switzerland. he was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate ("habilitation"). he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university of leipzig, again with ritschl's support.
despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted. to this day, nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured classics professors on record.
nietzsche's 1870 projected doctoral thesis, "contribution toward the study and the critique of the sources of diogenes laertius" ("beiträge zur quellenkunde und kritik des laertius diogenes"), examined the origins of the ideas of diogenes laërtius. though never submitted, it was later published as a "gratulationsschrift" (congratulatory publication) at basel.
before moving to basel, nietzsche renounced his prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially stateless.
nevertheless, nietzsche served in the prussian forces during the franco-prussian war (1870–1871) as a medical orderly. in his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. he also contracted diphtheria and dysentery. walter kaufmann speculates that he might also have contracted syphilis at a brothel along with his other infections at this time. on returning to basel in 1870, nietzsche observed the establishment of the german empire and otto von bismarck's subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding their genuineness. his inaugural lecture at the university was "". nietzsche also met franz overbeck, a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. afrikan spir, a little-known russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 "thought and reality", and nietzsche's colleague the famed historian jacob burckhardt, whose lectures nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.
nietzsche had already met richard wagner in leipzig in 1868 and later wagner's wife, cosima. nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at basel frequently visited wagner's house in tribschen in lucerne. the wagners brought nietzsche into their most intimate circle—including franz liszt, of whom nietzsche colloquially described: "liszt or the art of running after women!". nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the bayreuth festival. in 1870, he gave cosima wagner the manuscript of "the genesis of the tragic idea" as a birthday gift. in 1872, nietzsche published his first book, "the birth of tragedy". however, his colleagues within his field, including ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. in his polemic "philology of the future", ulrich von wilamowitz-moellendorff dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. in response, rohde (then a professor in kiel) and wagner came to nietzsche's defense. nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at basel instead.
in 1873, nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as "philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks". between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: "david strauss: the confessor and the writer", "on the use and abuse of history for life", "schopenhauer as educator" and "richard wagner in bayreuth". these four later appeared in a collected edition under the title "untimely meditations". the essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing german culture along lines suggested by schopenhauer and wagner. during this time in the circle of the wagners, he met malwida von meysenbug and hans von bülow. he also began a friendship with paul rée, who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. however, he was deeply disappointed by the bayreuth festival of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. he was also alienated by wagner's championing of "german culture", which nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by wagner's celebration of his fame among the german public. all this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from wagner.
with the publication in 1878 of "human, all too human" (a book of aphorisms ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by afrikan spir's "thought and reality" and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of wagner and schopenhauer. nietzsche's friendship with deussen and rohde cooled as well. in 1879, after a significant decline in health, nietzsche had to resign his position at basel. since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, migraine headaches, and violent indigestion. the 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.
living off his pension from basel and aid from friends, nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. he spent many summers in sils maria near st. moritz in switzerland. he spent his winters in the italian cities of genoa, rapallo, and turin and the french city of nice. in 1881, when france occupied tunisia, he planned to travel to tunis to view europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons. nietzsche occasionally returned to naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and his sister had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.
while in genoa, nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of typewriters as a means of continuing to write. he is known to have tried using the hansen writing ball, a contemporary typewriter device. in the end, a past student of his, heinrich köselitz or peter gast, became a sort of private secretary to nietzsche. in 1876, gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of nietzsche for the first time with richard wagner in bayreuth. he subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of nietzsche's work from then on. on at least one occasion on 23 february 1880, the usually poor gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, paul rée. gast was one of the very few friends nietzsche allowed to criticize him. in responding most enthusiastically to "also sprach zarathustra" ("thus spoke zarathustra"), gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as "superfluous" people were in fact quite necessary. he went on to list the number of people epicurus, for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.
to the end of his life, gast and overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. malwida von meysenbug remained like a motherly patron even outside the wagner circle. soon nietzsche made contact with the music-critic carl fuchs. nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. beginning with "human, all too human" in 1878, nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.
in 1882, nietzsche published the first part of "the gay science". that year he also met lou andreas-salomé, through malwida von meysenbug and paul rée.
salomé's mother took her to rome when salomé was 21. at a literary salon in the city, salomé became acquainted with paul rée. rée proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as "brother and sister", along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune. rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend nietzsche. the two met nietzsche in rome in april 1882, and nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with salome, as rée had done. nietzsche asked rée to propose marriage to salome, which she rejected. she had been interested in nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband. nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with rée and salome touring through switzerland and italy together, planning their commune. the three traveled with salomé's mother through italy and considered where they would set up their "winterplan" commune. this commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found. on 13 may, in lucerne, when nietzsche was alone with salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. he nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune. after discovering the situation, nietzsche's sister elizabeth became determined to get nietzsche away from the "immoral woman".
nietzsche and salomé spent the summer together in tautenburg in thuringia, often with nietzsche's sister elisabeth as a chaperone. salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question. arriving in leipzig, (germany) in october, salomé and rée separated from nietzsche after a falling-out between nietzsche and salomé, in which salomé believed that nietzsche was desperately in love with her.
while the three spent a number of weeks together in leipzig in october 1882, the following month rée and salome ditched nietzsche, leaving for stibbe (today zdbowo in poland) without any plans to meet again. nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to rée, stating "we shall see one another from time to time, won't we?" in later recriminations, nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo salome both on salome, rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of salome and rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt "genuine hatred for my sister."
amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding salomé, nietzsche fled to rapallo, where he wrote the first part of "also sprach zarathustra" in only ten days.
by 1882, nietzsche was taking huge doses of opium, but he was still having trouble sleeping. in 1883, while staying in nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative chloral hydrate, signing them "dr. nietzsche".
after severing his philosophical ties with schopenhauer (who was long dead and never met nietzsche) and his social ties with wagner, nietzsche had few remaining friends. now, with the new style of "zarathustra", his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. his books remained largely unsold. in 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of "zarathustra" and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including helene von druskowitz.
in 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the university of leipzig. it was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards christianity and his concept of god, he had become effectively unemployable by any german university. the subsequent "feelings of revenge and resentment" embittered him: "and hence my rage since i have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) "suffice" to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils."
in 1886, nietzsche broke with his publisher ernst schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. nietzsche saw his own writings as "completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-semitic dump" of schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be "utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind". he then printed "beyond good and evil" at his own expense. he also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of "the birth of tragedy", "human, all too human", "daybreak", and "the gay science" with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. in fact, interest in nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. during these years nietzsche met meta von salis, carl spitteler, and gottfried keller.
in 1886, his sister elisabeth married the antisemite bernhard förster and travelled to paraguay to found nueva germania, a "germanic" colony—a plan nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter. through correspondence, nietzsche's relationship with elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. he continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.
in 1887, nietzsche wrote the polemic "on the genealogy of morality". during the same year, he encountered the work of fyodor dostoyevsky, to whom he felt an immediate kinship. he also exchanged letters with hippolyte taine and georg brandes. brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of søren kierkegaard in the 1870s, wrote to nietzsche asking him to read kierkegaard, to which nietzsche replied that he would come to copenhagen and read kierkegaard with him. however, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. in the beginning of 1888, brandes delivered in copenhagen one of the first lectures on nietzsche's philosophy.
although nietzsche had previously announced at the end of "on the genealogy of morality" a new work with the title "the will to power: attempt at a revaluation of all values", he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose "twilight of the idols" and "the antichrist" in 1888.
his health seemed to improve and he spent the summer in high spirits. in the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and "fate". he overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, "the case of wagner". on his 44th birthday, after completing "twilight of the idols" and "the antichrist", he decided to write the autobiography "ecce homo". in its preface—which suggests nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, "hear me! for i am such and such a person. above all, do not mistake me for someone else." in december, nietzsche began a correspondence with august strindberg and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other european languages. moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation "nietzsche contra wagner" and of the poems that made up his collection "dionysian-dithyrambs".
on 3 january 1889, nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown. two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of turin. what happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the piazza carlo alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.
in the following few days, nietzsche sent short writings—known as the "wahnzettel" ("madness letters")—to a number of friends including cosima wagner and jacob burckhardt. most of them were signed "dionysos", though some were also signed "der gekreuzigte" meaning "the crucified one". to his former colleague burckhardt, nietzsche wrote: "i have had caiaphas put in fetters. also, last year i was crucified by the german doctors in a very drawn-out manner. wilhelm, bismarck, and all anti-semites abolished." additionally, he commanded the german emperor to go to rome to be shot and summoned the european powers to take military action against germany, that the pope should be put in jail and that he, nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-semites shot dead.
on 6 january 1889, burckhardt showed the letter he had received from nietzsche to overbeck. the following day, overbeck received a similar letter and decided that nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to basel. overbeck travelled to turin and brought nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in basel. by that time nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in jena under the direction of otto binswanger. in january 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of "twilight of the idols", by that time already printed and bound. from november 1889 to february 1890, the art historian julius langbehn attempted to cure nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating nietzsche's condition. langbehn assumed progressively greater control of nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. in march 1890, franziska removed nietzsche from the clinic and, in may 1890, brought him to her home in naumburg. during this process overbeck and gast contemplated what to do with nietzsche's unpublished works. in february, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of "nietzsche contra wagner", but the publisher c.g. naumann secretly printed one hundred. overbeck and gast decided to withhold publishing "the antichrist" and "ecce homo" because of their more radical content. nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.
in 1893, nietzsche's sister elisabeth returned from nueva germania in paraguay following the suicide of her husband. she read and studied nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and gast finally co-operated. after the death of franziska in 1897, nietzsche lived in weimar, where elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including rudolf steiner (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising nietzsche), to meet her uncommunicative brother. elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.
nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as tertiary syphilis, in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, georges bataille dropped dark hints ("'man incarnate' must also go mad") and rené girard's postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with richard wagner. nietzsche had previously written, "all superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad." (daybreak, 14) the diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of "manic-depressive illness with periodic psychosis followed by vascular dementia" was put forward by cybulska prior to schain's study. leonard sax suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital meningioma as an explanation of nietzsche's dementia; orth and trimble postulated frontotemporal dementia while other researchers have proposed a hereditary stroke disorder called cadasil.<ref>

frank vincent zappa (december 21, 1940 – december 4, 1993) was an american musician, composer, and bandleader. his work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of american culture. in a career spanning more than 30 years, zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and "musique concrète" works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the mothers of invention and as a solo artist. zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. he is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.
as a self-taught composer and performer, zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. while in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as edgard varèse, igor stravinsky, anton webern, and halim el-dabh, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music (such as johnny "guitar" watson, guitar slim, howlin' wolf and b.b. king). he began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. his 1966 debut album with the mothers of invention, "freak out!", combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. he continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.
zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "project/object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums. his lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the "godfather" of comedy rock. he was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship. unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs, but supported their decriminalization and regulation.
during zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. he had some commercial success, particularly in europe, and worked as an independent artist for most of his career. he remains a major influence on musicians and composers. his honors include his 1995 induction into the rock and roll hall of fame and the 1997 grammy lifetime achievement award. in 2000, he was ranked number 36 on vh1's "100 greatest artists of hard rock". in 2004, "rolling stone" magazine ranked him at number 71 on its list of the "100 greatest artists of all time", and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the "100 greatest guitarists of all time".
zappa was born on december 21, 1940 in baltimore, maryland. his mother, rosemarie ( collimore) was of italian (neapolitan and sicilian) and french ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to francis vincent zappa, was an immigrant from partinico, sicily, with greek and arab descent.
frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an italian-american household where italian was often spoken by his grandparents. the family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. after a time in florida in the 1940s, the family returned to maryland, where zappa's father worked at the edgewood arsenal chemical warfare facility of the aberdeen proving ground run by the u.s. army. due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident. this living arrangement had a profound effect on zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur frequently throughout his work.
zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. a doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium into each of zappa's nostrils. at the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.
nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator cal schenkel. zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility, and his health worsened when he lived in baltimore. in 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health to monterey, california, where his father taught metallurgy at the naval postgraduate school. they soon moved to claremont, california, and then to el cajon, before finally settling in san diego.
zappa joined his first band at mission bay high school in san diego as the drummer. at about the same time, his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection. r&b singles were early purchases, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life. he was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. by age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion. zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began when he read a "look" magazine article about the sam goody record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an lp as obscure as "the complete works of edgard varèse, volume one". the article described varèse's percussion composition "ionisation", produced by ems recordings, as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". zappa decided to seek out varèse's music. after searching for over a year, zappa found a copy (he noticed the lp because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of varèse on the cover). not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount. thus began his lifelong passion for varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers. he also liked the italian classical music listened to by his grandparents, especially puccini's opera arias.
by 1956, the zappa family had moved to lancaster, a small aerospace and farming town in the antelope valley of the mojave desert close to edwards air force base; he would later refer to sun village (a town close to lancaster) in the 1973 track "village of the sun". zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. although she disliked varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present. unfortunately, varèse was in europe at the time, so zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later. in a letter varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition he was working on called "déserts". living in the desert town of lancaster, zappa found this very exciting. varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to new york. the meeting never took place (varèse died in 1965), but zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.
at antelope valley high school, zappa met don glen vliet (who later changed his name to don van vliet and adopted the stage name captain beefheart). zappa and vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in r&b records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers. around the same time, zappa started playing drums in a local band, the blackouts. the band was racially diverse and included euclid james "motorhead" sherwood who later became a member of the mothers of invention. zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument. among his early influences were johnny "guitar" watson, howlin' wolf and clarence "gatemouth" brown. (in the 1970s/80s, he invited watson to perform on several albums.) zappa considered soloing as the equivalent of forming "air sculptures", and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style. he was also influenced by egyptian composer halim el-dabh.
zappa's interest in composing and arranging flourished in his last high-school years. by his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. he graduated from antelope valley high school in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album "freak out!" due to his family's frequent moves, zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics. in 1959, he attended chaffey college but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.
zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in echo park, los angeles. after meeting kathryn j. "kay" sherman during his short period of private composition study with prof. karl kohn of pomona college, they moved in together in ontario, and were married december 28, 1960. zappa worked for a short period in advertising as a copywriter. his sojourn in the commercial world was brief, but gave him valuable insights into its workings. throughout his career, he took a keen interest in the visual presentation of his work, designing some of his album covers and directing his own films and videos.
zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of the blackouts. zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films "the world's greatest sinner" (1962) and "run home slow" (1965) were more financially rewarding. the former score was commissioned by actor-producer timothy carey and recorded in 1961. it contains many themes that appeared on later zappa records. the latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot. excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album "the lost episodes" (1996).
during the early 1960s, zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter ray collins and producer paul buff. their "memories of el monte" was recorded by the penguins, although only cleve duncan of the original group was featured. buff owned the small pal recording studio in cucamonga, which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. at that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had multi-track facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track. although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it. he appeared on steve allen's syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument. using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument. with captain beefheart, zappa recorded some songs under the name of the soots. they were rejected by dot records for having "no commercial potential", a verdict zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of "freak out!"
in 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the pal studio and began routinely working 12 hours or more per day recording and experimenting with overdubbing and audio tape manipulation. this established a work pattern that endured for most of his life. aided by his income from film composing, zappa took over the studio from paul buff, who was now working with art laboe at original sound. it was renamed studio z. studio z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. instead, friends moved in, notably james "motorhead" sherwood. zappa started performing in local bars as a guitarist with a power trio, the muthers, to support himself.
an article in the local press describing zappa as "the movie king of cucamonga" prompted the local police to suspect that he was making pornographic films. in march 1965, zappa was approached by a vice squad undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 () to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged stag party. zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. when zappa was about to hand over the tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material. the press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's "the daily report" wrote that "vice squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer". zappa was charged with "conspiracy to commit pornography". this felony charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a misdemeanor, with all but ten days suspended. his brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance. zappa lost several recordings made at studio z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized. eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted. zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.
in 1965, ray collins asked zappa to take over as guitarist in local r&b band the soul giants, following a fight between collins and the group's original guitarist. zappa accepted, and soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer). he convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract. the band was renamed the mothers, coincidentally on mother's day. they increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager herb cohen, while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning los angeles underground music scene. in early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer tom wilson when playing "trouble every day", a song about the watts riots. wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for bob dylan and simon & garfunkel, and was notable as one of the few african-americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. wilson signed the mothers to the verve division of mgm, which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves the mothers of invention as "mother" was short for "motherfucker"—a term that, apart from its profane meanings, can denote a skilled musician.
with wilson credited as producer, the mothers of invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking "freak out!" (1966), which, after bob dylan's "blonde on blonde", was the second rock double album ever released. it mixed r&b, doo-wop, musique concrète, and experimental sound collages that captured the "freak" subculture of los angeles at that time. although he was dissatisfied with the final product, "freak out" immediately established zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of america". the sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. while recording in the studio, some of the additional session musicians were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from charts with zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music. the lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had dadaist elements. yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs. most compositions are zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. he had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most overdubs. wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed. although wilson was able to provide zappa and the mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. in a surviving 1967 radio interview, zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, "return of the son of monster magnet" was in fact an unfinished piece. the track (as it appears on the album) was created to act as the backing track for a much more complex work, but mgm refused to approve the additional recording time zappa needed to complete it, so (much to his chagrin) it was issued in this unfinished form.
during the recording of "freak out!", zappa moved into a house in laurel canyon with friend pamela zarubica, who appeared on the album. the house became a meeting (and living) place for many la musicians and groupies of the time, despite zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use. after a short promotional tour following the release of "freak out!", zappa met adelaide gail sloatman. he fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer. they married in 1967, had four children and remained together until zappa's death.
wilson nominally produced the mothers' second album "absolutely free" (1967), which was recorded in november 1966, and later mixed in new york, although by this time zappa was in "de facto" control of most facets of the production. it featured extended playing by the mothers of invention and focused on songs that defined zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements. examples are "plastic people" and "brown shoes don't make it", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of american society, but also of the counterculture of the 1960s. as zappa put it, "[w]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything." at the same time, zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, "lumpy gravy", released by capitol records in 1967. due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. after the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by verve in 1968. it is an "incredible ambitious musical project", a "monument to john cage", which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical audio editing techniques.
the mothers of invention played in new york in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the garrick theater (at 152 bleecker street, above the cafe au go go) during easter 1967. this proved successful and herb cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. as a result, zappa and his wife, along with the mothers of invention, moved to new york. their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of zappa's music. everything was directed by zappa using hand signals. guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the garrick theater shows. one evening, zappa managed to entice some u.s. marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by zappa to pretend that it was a "gook baby".
zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. bands such as amm and faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. situated in new york, and only interrupted by the band's first european tour, the mothers of invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, "we're only in it for the money" (released 1968). it was produced by zappa, with wilson credited as executive producer. from then on, zappa produced all albums released by the mothers of invention and as a solo artist. "we're only in it for the money" featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. he sampled plundered surf music in "we're only in it for the money", as well as the beatles' tape work from their song "tomorrow never knows". the cover photo parodied that of the beatles' "sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band". the cover art was provided by cal schenkel whom zappa met in new york. this initiated a lifelong collaboration in which schenkel designed covers for numerous zappa and mothers albums.
reflecting zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, "cruising with ruben & the jets" (1968), was very different. it represented a collection of doo-wop songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute. zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "if he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same ... to doo-wop in the fifties?" a theme from stravinsky's "the rite of spring" is heard during one song.
during the late 1960s, zappa continued to develop the business sides of his career. he and herb cohen formed the bizarre records and straight records labels, distributed by warner bros. records, as ventures to aid the funding of projects and to increase creative control. zappa produced the double album "trout mask replica" for captain beefheart, and releases by alice cooper, the persuasions, wild man fischer, and the gtos, as well as lenny bruce's last live performance.
in 1967 and 1968, zappa made two appearances with the monkees. the first appearance was on an episode of their tv series, "the monkees blow their minds", where zappa, dressed up as mike nesmith, interviews nesmith who is dressed up as zappa. after the interview, zappa destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "mother people" plays. he later provided a cameo in the monkees' movie "head" where, leading a cow, he tells davy jones "the youth of america depends on you to show them the way." zappa had respect for what the monkees were doing, and offered micky dolenz a position in the mothers. rca/columbia/colgems would not allow dolenz out of his contract.
in the mothers' second european tour in september/october 1968 they performed for the at the grugahalle in essen, germany; at the tivoli in copenhagen, denmark; for tv programs in germany ("beat-club"), france, and england; at the concertgebouw in amsterdam; at the royal festival hall in london; and at the olympia in paris.
zappa and the mothers of invention returned to los angeles in mid-1968, and the zappas moved into a house on laurel canyon boulevard, only to move again to one on woodrow wilson drive. this was zappa's home for the rest of his life. despite being a success with fans in europe, the mothers of invention were not faring well financially. their first records were vocally oriented, but zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his "electrical chamber music".
in 1969 there were nine band members and zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing royalties whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year zappa, fed up with mgm records' interference, left them for warner bros. records' reprise subsidiary where zappa/mothers recordings would bear the bizarre records imprint.
in late 1969, zappa broke up the band. he often cited the financial strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. many band members were bitter about zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. several members played for zappa in years to come. remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on "weasels ripped my flesh" and "burnt weeny sandwich" (both released in 1970).
after he disbanded the mothers of invention, zappa released the acclaimed solo album "hot rats" (1969). it features, for the first time on record, zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, "peaches en regalia", which reappeared several times on future recordings. he was backed by jazz, blues and r&b session players including violinist don "sugarcane" harris, drummers john guerin and paul humphrey, multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the mothers of invention ian underwood, and multi-instrumentalist shuggie otis on bass, along with a guest appearance by captain beefheart (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, "willie the pimp"). it became a popular album in england, and had a major influence on the development of the jazz-rock fusion genre.
in 1970 zappa met conductor zubin mehta. they arranged a may 1970 concert where mehta conducted the los angeles philharmonic augmented by a rock band. according to zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the mothers of invention. some of it was later featured in the movie "200 motels". although the concert was a success, zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. his dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.
later in 1970, zappa formed a new version of the mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of invention"). it included british drummer aynsley dunbar, jazz keyboardist george duke, ian underwood, jeff simmons (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of the turtles: bass player jim pons, and singers mark volman and howard kaylan, who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "the phlorescent leech and eddie", or "flo & eddie".
this version of the mothers debuted on zappa's next solo album "chunga's revenge" (1970), which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie "200 motels" (1971), featuring the mothers, the royal philharmonic orchestra, ringo starr, theodore bikel, and keith moon. co-directed by zappa and tony palmer, it was filmed in a week at pinewood studios outside london. tensions between zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. the film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician. it was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to 35 mm film, a process that allowed for novel visual effects. it was released to mixed reviews. the score relied extensively on orchestral music, and zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the royal albert hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. in 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the royal albert hall for breach of contract.
after "200 motels", the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, "fillmore east – june 1971" and "just another band from l.a."; the latter included the 20-minute track "billy the mountain", zappa's satire on rock opera set in southern california. this track was representative of the band's theatrical performances—which used songs to build sketches based on "200 motels" scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road.
on december 4, 1971, zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. while performing at casino de montreux in switzerland, the mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino. immortalized in deep purple's song "smoke on the water", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album "swiss cheese/fire", released legally as part of zappa's "beat the boots ii" compilation. after losing $50,000 () worth of equipment and a week's break, the mothers played at the rainbow theatre, london, with rented gear. during the encore, an audience member jealous because of his girlfriend's infatuation with zappa pushed him off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. the band thought zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed larynx, which ultimately caused his voice to drop a third after healing.
this attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. upon return to the stage in september 1972, zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "zomby woof" and "dancin' fool"), resulting in chronic back pain. meanwhile, the mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of flo and eddie's band as they set out on their own.
during 1971–72 zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo lps, "waka/jawaka" and "the grand wazoo", which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and mothers alumni. musically, the albums were akin to "hot rats," in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing. zappa began touring again in late 1972. his first effort was a series of concerts in september 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the grand wazoo. this was followed by a scaled-down version known as the petit wazoo that toured the u.s. for five weeks from october to december 1972.
zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included ian underwood (reeds, keyboards), ruth underwood (vibes, marimba), sal marquez (trumpet, vocals), napoleon murphy brock (sax, flute and vocals), bruce fowler (trombone), tom fowler (bass), chester thompson (drums), ralph humphrey (drums), george duke (keyboards, vocals), and jean-luc ponty (violin).
by 1973 the bizarre and straight labels were discontinued. in their place, zappa and cohen created discreet records, also distributed by warner bros. zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album "apostrophe (')" (1974), which reached a career-high no. 10 on the "billboard" pop album charts helped by the no. 86 chart hit "don't eat the yellow snow". other albums from the period are "over-nite sensation" (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as "dinah-moe humm" and "montana", and the albums "roxy & elsewhere" (1974) and "one size fits all" (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as "inca roads", "echidna's arf (of you)" and "be-bop tango (of the old jazzmen's church)". a live recording from 1974, "you can't do that on stage anymore, vol. 2" (1988), captures "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". zappa released "bongo fury" (1975), which featured a live recording at the armadillo world headquarters in austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with captain beefheart for a brief period. they later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of zappa's life.
zappa's relationship with long-time manager herb cohen ended in 1976. zappa sued cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from discreet records, as well as for signing acts of which zappa did not approve. cohen filed a lawsuit against zappa in return, which froze the money zappa and cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with mgm over the rights of the early mothers of invention recordings. it also prevented zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented "zoot allures" (1976) directly to warner bros., thereby bypassing discreet.
in the mid-1970s zappa prepared material for "läther" (pronounced "leather"), a four-lp project. "läther" encapsulated all the aspects of zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. wary of a quadruple-lp, warner bros. records refused to release it. zappa managed to get an agreement with phonogram inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a halloween 1977 release, but warner bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. zappa responded by appearing on the pasadena, california radio station kroq, allowing them to broadcast "läther" and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. a lawsuit between zappa and warner bros. followed, during which no zappa material was released for more than a year. eventually, warner bros. issued different versions of much of the "läther" material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length lps) with limited promotion.
although zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the mgm and warner bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. drummer terry bozzio became a regular band member, napoleon murphy brock stayed on for a while, and original mothers of invention bassist roy estrada joined. among other musicians were bassist patrick o'hearn, singer-guitarist ray white and keyboardist/violinist eddie jobson. in december 1976, zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the nbc television show "saturday night live". zappa's song "i'm the slime" was performed with a voice-over by "snl" booth announcer don pardo, who also introduced "peaches en regalia" on the same airing. in 1978, zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. the performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member john belushi during the instrumental piece "the purple lagoon". belushi appeared as his samurai futaba character playing the tenor sax with zappa conducting.
zappa's band at the time, with the additions of ruth underwood and a horn section (featuring michael and randy brecker), performed during christmas in new york, recordings of which appear on one of the albums warner bros. culled from the "läther" project, "zappa in new york" (1978). it mixes complex instrumentals such as "the black page" and humorous songs like "titties and beer". the former composition, written originally for drum kit but later developed for larger bands, is notorious for its complexity in rhythmic structure and short, densely arranged passages.
"zappa in new york" featured a song about sex criminal michael h. kenyon, "the illinois enema bandit", which featured don pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. zappa dismissed the criticism by noting that he was a journalist reporting on life as he saw it. predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: "what do you make of a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the moment you hear them?" the remaining albums released by warner bros. records without zappa's consent were "studio tan" in 1978 and "sleep dirt" and "orchestral favorites" in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was overlooked in the midst of the legal problems.
resolving the lawsuits successfully, zappa ended the 1970s by releasing two of his most successful albums in 1979: the best-selling album of his career, "sheik yerbouti", and in kelley lowe's opinion the "bona fide masterpiece", "joe's garage".
the double album "sheik yerbouti" was the first release on zappa records, and contained the grammy-nominated single "dancin' fool", which reached no. 45 on the "billboard" charts, and "jewish princess", which received attention when a jewish group, the anti-defamation league (adl), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged anti-semitic lyrics. zappa vehemently denied any anti-semitic sentiments, and dismissed the adl as a "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of jews that suits their idea of a good time." the album's commercial success was attributable in part to "bobby brown". due to its explicit lyrics about a young man's encounter with a "dyke by the name of freddie", the song did not get airplay in the u.s., but it topped the charts in several european countries where english is not the primary language. the triple lp "joe's garage" featured lead singer ike willis as the voice of the character "joe" in a rock opera about the danger of political systems, the suppression of freedom of speech and music—inspired in part by the islamic revolution that had made music illegal within its jurisdiction at the time—and about the "strange relationship americans have with sex and sexual frankness". the album contains rock songs like "catholic girls" (a riposte to the controversies of "jewish princess"), "lucille has messed my mind up", and the title track, as well as extended live-recorded guitar improvisations combined with a studio backup band dominated by drummer vinnie colaiuta (with whom zappa had a particularly good musical rapport) adopting the xenochrony process. the album contains one of zappa's most famous guitar "signature pieces", "watermelon in easter hay".
on december 21, 1979, zappa's movie "baby snakes" premiered in new york. the movie's tagline was "a movie about people who do stuff that is not normal". the 2 hour and 40 minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in new york around halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist tommy mars and percussionist ed mann (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist adrian belew. it also contained several extraordinary sequences of clay animation by bruce bickford who had earlier provided animation sequences to zappa for a 1974 tv special (which became available on the 1982 video "the dub room special").282 the movie did not do well in theatrical distribution, but won the premier grand prix at the first international music festival in paris in 1981.
zappa later expanded on his television appearances in a non-musical role. he was an actor or voice artist in episodes of "shelley duvall's faerie tale theatre", "miami vice" and "the ren & stimpy show". a voice part in "the simpsons" never materialized, to creator matt groening's disappointment (groening was a neighbor of zappa and a lifelong fan).
1976 saw the release of good singin', good playin' by grand funk railroad and produced by zappa.
in 1980, zappa cut his ties with record distributor phonogram after the label refused to release his song "i don't wanna get drafted". it was picked up by cbs records and released on the zappa label in the united states and canada, and by the cbs label internationally.
after spending much of 1980 on the road, zappa released "tinsel town rebellion" in 1981. it was the first release on his own barking pumpkin records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. the album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and zappa's use of "sprechstimme" (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as arnold schoenberg and alban berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer vinnie colaiuta). while some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and "the blue light" have been described as a "hilarious critique of the willingness of the american people to believe anything". the album is also notable for the presence of guitarist steve vai, who joined zappa's touring band in late 1980.
the same year the double album "you are what you is" was released. most of it was recorded in zappa's brand new utility muffin research kitchen (umrk) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. the album included one complex instrumental, "theme from the 3rd movement of sinister footwear", but mainly consisted of rock songs with zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. "dumb all over" is a tirade on religion, as is "heavenly bank account", wherein zappa rails against tv evangelists such as jerry falwell and pat robertson for their purported influence on the u.s. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money. songs like "society pages" and "i'm a beautiful guy" show zappa's dismay with the reagan era and its "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".
in 1981, zappa also released three instrumental albums, "shut up 'n play yer guitar", "shut up 'n play yer guitar some more", and "the return of the son of shut up 'n play yer guitar", which were initially sold via mail order, but later released through the cbs label due to popular demand.
the albums focus exclusively on frank zappa as a guitar soloist, and the tracks are predominantly live recordings from 1979 to 1980; they highlight zappa's improvisational skills with "beautiful performances from the backing group as well". another guitar-only album, "guitar", was released in 1988, and a third, "trance-fusion", which zappa completed shortly before his death, was released in 2006.
in may 1982, zappa released "ship arriving too late to save a drowning witch", which featured his biggest selling single ever, the grammy award-nominated song "valley girl" (topping out at no. 32 on the "billboard" charts). in her improvised lyrics to the song, zappa's daughter moon unit satirized the patois of teenage girls from the san fernando valley, which popularized many "valspeak" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon", "fer sure, fer sure", "grody to the max", and "barf out".
in 1983, two different projects were released, beginning with "the man from utopia," a rock-oriented work. the album is eclectic, featuring the vocal-led "dangerous kitchen" and "the jazz discharge party hats", both continuations of the sprechstimme excursions on "tinseltown rebellion." the second album, "london symphony orchestra, vol. i", contained orchestral zappa compositions conducted by kent nagano and performed by the london symphony orchestra (lso). a second record of these sessions, "london symphony orchestra, vol. ii" was released in 1987. the material was recorded under a tight schedule with zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "valley girl". zappa was not satisfied with the lso recordings. one reason is "strictly genteel", which was recorded after the trumpet section had been out for drinks on a break: the track took 40 edits to hide out-of-tune notes.
conductor nagano, who was pleased with the experience, noted that "in fairness to the orchestra, the music is humanly very, very difficult". some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of zappa's orchestral work so far. in 1984 zappa teamed again with nagano and the berkeley symphony orchestra for a live performance of "a zappa affair" with augmented orchestra, life-size puppets, and moving stage sets. although critically acclaimed the work was a financial failure, and only performed twice. zappa was invited by conference organizer thomas wells to be the keynote speaker at the american society of university composers at the ohio state university. it was there zappa delivered his famous "bingo! there goes your tenure" address, and had two of his orchestra pieces, "dupree's paradise" and "naval aviation in art?" performed by the columbus symphony and promusica chamber orchestra of columbus.
for the remainder of his career, much of zappa's work was influenced by his use of the synclavier as a compositional and performance tool. even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the synclavier could realize anything he could dream up. the synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: "with the synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages ... with "one-millisecond" accuracy—every time". even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians, zappa viewed the synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.
in 1984, he released four albums. "" contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist pierre boulez (who was listed as an influence on "freak out!"), and performed by his ensemble intercontemporain. these were juxtaposed with premiere synclavier pieces. again, zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks boulez's demands for precision. the synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, sampled.
the album "thing-fish" was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a broadway play dealing with a dystopian "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the aids virus, and a eugenics program conducted by the united states government. new vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new synclavier music; "the work is an extraordinary example of bricolage".
"francesco zappa", a synclavier rendition of works by 18th-century composer francesco zappa was also released in 1984.
around 1986, zappa undertook a comprehensive re-release program of his earlier vinyl recordings. he personally oversaw the remastering of all his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s albums for the new digital compact disc medium. certain aspects of these re-issues were criticized by some fans as being unfaithful to the original recordings. nearly twenty years before the advent of online music stores, zappa had proposed to replace "phonographic record merchandising" of music by "direct digital-to-digital transfer" through phone or cable tv (with royalty payments and consumer billing automatically built into the accompanying software). in 1989, zappa considered his idea a "miserable flop".
the album "jazz from hell," released in 1986, earned zappa his first grammy award in 1988 for best rock instrumental performance. except for one live guitar solo ("st. etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the synclavier. although an instrumental album, containing no lyrics, meyer music markets sold "jazz from hell" featuring an "explicit lyrics" sticker—a warning label introduced by the recording industry association of america in an agreement with the parents music resource center (pmrc).
zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed. the tour was documented on the albums "broadway the hard way" (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); "the best band you never heard in your life" (zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from maurice ravel's "boléro" to led zeppelin's "stairway to heaven"); and "make a jazz noise here". parts are also found on "you can't do that on stage anymore", volumes 4 and 6. recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album trance-fusion.
in 1990, zappa was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. the disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable. after the diagnosis, zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and synclavier works. shortly before his death in 1993 he completed "civilization phaze iii", a major synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.
in 1991, zappa was chosen to be one of four featured composers at the frankfurt festival in 1992 (the others were john cage, karlheinz stockhausen, and alexander knaifel). zappa was approached by the german chamber ensemble ensemble modern which was interested in playing his music for the event. although ill, he invited them to los angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material. zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in germany and austria were set up for later in the year. zappa also performed in 1991 in prague, claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".
in september 1992, the concerts went ahead as scheduled but zappa could only appear at two in frankfurt due to illness. at the first concert, he conducted the opening "overture", and the final "g-spot tornado" as well as the theatrical "food gathering in post-industrial america, 1992" and "welcome to the united states" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor peter rundel). zappa received a 20-minute ovation. g-spot tornado was performed with canadian dancer louise lecavalier. it was his last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating". recordings from the concerts appeared on "the yellow shark" (1993), zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous "everything is healing nicely" (1999).
zappa died from prostate cancer on december 4, 1993, 17 days before his 53rd birthday at his home with his wife and children by his side. at a private ceremony the following day, his body was buried in a grave at the westwood village memorial park cemetery, in los angeles. the grave is unmarked. on december 6, his family publicly announced that "composer frank zappa left for his final tour just before 6:00 pm on saturday".
the general phases of zappa's music have been variously categorized under experimental rock, jazz, classical, avant-pop, experimental pop, comedy rock, doo-wop, jazz fusion, progressive rock, proto-prog, avant-jazz, and psychedelic rock.
zappa grew up influenced by avant-garde composers such as edgard varèse, igor stravinsky, and anton webern; 1950s blues artists clarence "gatemouth" brown, guitar slim, howlin' wolf, johnny "guitar" watson, and b.b. king; egyptian composer halim el-dabh; r&b and doo-wop groups (particularly local pachuco groups); and modern jazz. his own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater los angeles, were crucial in the formation of zappa as a practitioner of underground music and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. he frequently lampooned musical fads like psychedelia, rock opera and disco. television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.
zappa's albums make extensive use of segued tracks, breaklessly joining the elements of his albums. his total output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "project/object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums. he also called it a "conceptual continuity", meaning that any project or album was part of a larger project. everything was connected, and musical themes and lyrics reappeared in different form on later albums. conceptual continuity clues are found throughout zappa's entire œuvre.
zappa is widely recognized as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. in a 1983 issue of "guitar world", jon swenson declared: "the fact of the matter is that [zappa] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such." his idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. a november 2016 feature by the editors of "guitar player" magazine wrote: "brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." the symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. he was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by "unusual rhythmic combinations". his left hand was capable of smooth legato technique, while zappa's right was "one of the fastest pick hands in the business."
his song "outside now" from "joe's garage" poked fun at the negative reception of zappa's guitar technique by those more commercially minded, as the song's narrator lives in a world where music is outlawed and he imagines "imaginary guitar notes that would irritate/an executive kind of guy", lyrics that are followed by one of zappa's characteristically quirky solos in 11/8 time. zappa transcriptionist kasper sloots wrote, "zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right in front of an audience without knowing what the outcome will be." english guitarist and bandleader john mclaughlin opined that zappa was "very interesting as a human being and a very interesting composer" and that he "was a very good musician but he was a dictator in his band," and that he "was taking very long guitar solos – 10–15 minute guitar solos and really he should have taken two or three minute guitar solos, because they were a little bit boring."
in new york, zappa increasingly used tape editing as a compositional tool. a prime example is found on the double album "uncle meat" (1969), where the track "king kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. zappa had begun regularly recording concerts, and because of his insistence on precise tuning and timing, he was able to augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa. later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the tempo or meter of the sources. he dubbed this process "xenochrony" (strange synchronizations)—reflecting the greek "xeno" (alien or strange) and "chronos" (time).
zappa was married to kathryn j. "kay" sherman from 1960 to 1963. in 1967, he married adelaide gail sloatman. he and his second wife had four children: moon, dweezil, ahmet and diva.
following zappa's death, his widow gail created the zappa family trust, which owns the rights to zappa's music and other creative output: more than 60 albums were released during zappa's lifetime and 40 posthumously. upon gail's death in october 2015, zappa's youngest children, ahmet and diva, were given control of the trust with shares of 30% each, while his older children, moon and dweezil, were given smaller shares of 20% each.
zappa stated, "drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." he was a heavy tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.
while he disapproved of drug use, he criticized the war on drugs, comparing it to alcohol prohibition, and stated that the united states treasury would benefit from the decriminalization and regulation of drugs. describing his philosophical views, zappa stated, "i believe that people have a right to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. i also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. in a democracy, you own the government—it doesn't own you."
in a 1991 interview, zappa reported that he was a registered democrat but added "that might not last long—i'm going to shred that". describing his political views, zappa categorized himself as a "practical conservative". he favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. he favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. he opposed communism, stating, "a system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw." he had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. he even considered running for president of the united states as an independent.
zappa was an atheist. he recalled his parents being "pretty religious" and trying to make him go to catholic school despite his resentment. he felt disgust towards organized religion (christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided republicans and their policies, president ronald reagan, the strategic defense initiative (sdi), televangelism, and the christian right, and warned that the united states government was in danger of becoming a "fascist theocracy".
in early 1990, zappa visited czechoslovakia at the request of president václav havel. havel designated him as czechoslovakia's "special ambassador to the west on trade, culture and tourism". havel was a lifelong fan of zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in central europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a czech rock group that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from zappa's 1968 song "plastic people"). under pressure from secretary of state james baker, zappa's posting was withdrawn. havel made zappa an unofficial cultural attaché instead. zappa planned to develop an international consulting enterprise to facilitate trade between the former eastern bloc and western businesses.
zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on cnn's "crossfire" tv series and debated issues with "washington times" commentator john lofton in 1986. on september 19, 1985, zappa testified before the united states senate commerce, technology, and transportation committee, attacking the parents music resource center or pmrc, a music organization co-founded by tipper gore, wife of then-senator al gore. the pmrc consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. during zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the pmrc due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the "blank tape tax." kandy stroud, a spokeswoman for the pmrc, announced that senator gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by senator strom thurmond, who was also affiliated with the pmrc. zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.
zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.
in his prepared statement, he said:
the pmrc proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. it is my understanding that, in law, first amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. in this context, the pmrc's demands are the equivalent of treating dandruff by decapitation. ... the establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain christians do not like. what if the next bunch of washington wives demands a large yellow "j" on all material written or performed by jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed zionist doctrine?
zappa set excerpts from the pmrc hearings to synclavier music in his composition "porn wars" on the 1985 album "frank zappa meets the mothers of prevention", and the full recording was released in 2010 as "congress shall make no law..." zappa is heard interacting with senators fritz hollings, slade gorton and al gore.
zappa had a controversial critical standing during his lifetime. as geoffrey himes noted in 1993 after the artist's death, zappa was hailed as a genius by conductor kent nagano and nominated by czechoslovakian president václav havel to the country's cultural ambassadorship, but he was in his lifetime rejected twice for admission into the rock and roll hall of fame and been found by critics to lack emotional depth. in "" (1981), robert christgau dismissed zappa's music as "sexist adolescent drivel ... with meters and voicings and key changes that are as hard to play as they are easy to forget." according to himes:
"the rolling stone album guide" (2004) writes: "frank zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable." even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression.
in 1971, biographer david walley noted that "the whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite". on commenting on zappa's music, politics and philosophy, barry miles noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "it was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."
"guitar player" devoted a special issue to zappa in 1992, and asked on the cover "is fz america's best kept musical secret?" editor don menn remarked that the issue was about "the most important composer to come out of modern popular music".
among those contributing to the issue was composer and musicologist nicolas slonimsky, who conducted premiere performances of works of ives and varèse in the 1930s. he became friends with zappa in the 1980s, and said, "i admire everything frank does, because he practically created the new musical millennium. he does beautiful, beautiful work ... it has been my luck to have lived to see the emergence of this totally new type of music."
conductor kent nagano remarked in the same issue that "frank is a genius. that's a word i don't use often ... in frank's case it is not too strong ... he is extremely literate musically. i'm not sure if the general public knows that." pierre boulez told "musician" magazine's posthumous zappa tribute article that zappa "was an exceptional figure because he was part of the worlds of rock and classical music and that both types of his work would survive."
in 1994, jazz magazine "downbeat"s critics poll placed zappa in its hall of fame. zappa was posthumously inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1995. there, it was written that "frank zappa was rock and roll's sharpest musical mind and most astute social critic. he was the most prolific composer of his age, and he bridged genres—rock, jazz, classical, avant-garde and even novelty music—with masterful ease". he received the grammy lifetime achievement award in 1997. he was ranked number 36 on vh1's "100 greatest artists of hard rock" in 2000.
in 2005, the u.s. national recording preservation board included "we're only in it for the money" in the national recording registry as "frank zappa's inventive and iconoclastic album presents a unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and america's reactions to it". the same year, "rolling stone" magazine ranked him at no. 71 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.
in 2011, he was ranked at no. 22 on the list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time by the same magazine.
the street of partinico where his father lived at number 13, via zammatà, has been renamed to via frank zappa.
many musicians, bands and orchestras from diverse genres have been influenced by zappa's music. rock artists such as alice cooper, larry lalonde of primus, fee waybill of the tubes all cite zappa's influence, as do progressive, alternative, electronic and avant-garde/experimental rock artists like can, pere ubu, soft machine, henry cow, faust, devo, kraftwerk, trey anastasio of phish, jeff buckley, john frusciante, steven wilson, and the aristocrats. paul mccartney regarded "sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band" as the beatles' "freak out!", jimi hendrix, and heavy rock and metal acts like black sabbath, simon phillips, mike portnoy, warren demartini, steve vai, strapping young lad, system of a down, and clawfinger acknowledge zappa's inspiration. on the classical music scene, tomas ulrich, meridian arts ensemble, ensemble ambrosius and the fireworks ensemble regularly perform zappa's compositions and quote his influence. contemporary jazz musicians and composers bill frisell and john zorn are inspired by zappa, as is funk legend george clinton.
other artists affected by zappa include ambient composer brian eno, new age pianist george winston, electronic composer bob gluck, parodist artist and disk jockey dr. demento, parodist and novelty composer "weird al" yankovic, industrial music pioneer genesis p-orridge, singer cree summer, and noise music artist masami akita of merzbow.
scientists from various fields have honored zappa by naming new discoveries after him. in 1967, paleontologist leo p. plas, jr. identified an extinct mollusc in nevada and named it "amaurotoma zappa" with the motivation that, "the specific name, "zappa", honors frank zappa".
in the 1980s, biologist ed murdy named a genus of gobiid fishes of new guinea "zappa", with a species named "zappa confluentus". biologist ferdinando boero named a californian jellyfish "phialella zappai" (1987), noting that he had "pleasure in naming this species after the modern music composer".
belgian biologists bosmans and bosselaers discovered in the early 1980s a cameroonese spider, which they in 1994 named "pachygnatha zappa" because "the ventral side of the abdomen of the female of this species strikingly resembles the artist's legendary moustache".
a gene of the bacterium "proteus mirabilis" that causes urinary tract infections was in 1995 named "zapa" by three biologists from maryland. in their scientific article, they "especially thank the late frank zappa for inspiration and assistance with genetic nomenclature". repeating regions of the genome of the human tumor virus kshv were named "frnk", "vnct" and "zppa" in 1996 by the moore and chang who discovered the virus. also, a 143 base pair repeat sequence occurring at two positions was named "waka/jwka".
in the late 1990s, american paleontologists marc salak and halard l. lescinsky discovered a metazoan fossil, and named it "spygori zappania" to honor "the late frank zappa ... whose mission paralleled that of the earliest paleontologists: to challenge conventional and traditional beliefs when such beliefs lacked roots in logic and reason".
in 1994, lobbying efforts initiated by psychiatrist john scialli led the international astronomical union's minor planet center to name an asteroid in zappa's honor: 3834 zappafrank. the asteroid was discovered in 1980 by czechoslovakian astronomer ladislav brožek, and the citation for its naming says that "zappa was an eclectic, self-trained artist and composer ... before 1989 he was regarded as a symbol of democracy and freedom by many people in czechoslovakia".
in 1995, a bust of zappa by sculptor konstantinas bogdanas was installed in vilnius, the lithuanian capital (54.683, 25.2759). the choice of zappa was explained as "a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom." a replica was offered to the city of baltimore in 2008, and on september 19, 2010 — the twenty-fifth anniversary of zappa's testimony to the u.s. senate — a ceremony dedicating the replica was held, and the bust was unveiled at a library in the city.
in 2002, a bronze bust was installed in german city bad doberan, location of the "zappanale" since 1990, an annual music festival celebrating zappa. at the initiative of musicians community orwohaus, the city of berlin named a street in the marzahn district "frank-zappa-straße" in 2007. the same year, baltimore mayor sheila dixon proclaimed august 9 as the city's official "frank zappa day" citing zappa's musical accomplishments as well as his defense of the first amendment to the united states constitution.
during his lifetime, zappa released 62 albums. since 1994, the zappa family trust has released 50 posthumous albums, making a total of 112 albums. the current distributor of zappa's recorded output is universal music enterprises.

the fagales are an order of flowering plants, including some of the best-known trees. the order name is derived from genus "fagus", beeches. they belong among the rosid group of dicotyledons. the families and genera currently included are as follows:
the older cronquist system only included four families (betulaceae, corylaceae, fagaceae, ticodendraceae; corylaceae now being included within betulaceae); this arrangement is followed by, for example, the world checklist of selected plant families. the other families were split into three different orders, placed among the hamamelidae. the casuarinales comprised the single family casuarinaceae, the juglandales comprised the juglandaceae and rhoipteleaceae, and the myricales comprised the remaining forms (plus "balanops"). the change is due to studies suggesting the myricales, so defined, are paraphyletic to the other two groups.
modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

the fabales are an order of flowering plants included in the rosid group of the eudicots in the angiosperm phylogeny group ii classification system. in the apg ii circumscription, this order includes the families fabaceae or legumes (including the subfamilies caesalpinioideae, mimosoideae, and faboideae), quillajaceae, polygalaceae or milkworts (including the families diclidantheraceae, moutabeaceae, and xanthophyllaceae), and surianaceae. under the cronquist system and some other plant classification systems, the order fabales contains only the family fabaceae. in the classification system of dahlgren the fabales were in the superorder fabiflorae (also called fabanae) with three familiese corresponding to the subfamilies of fabaceae in apg ii. the other families treated in the fabales by the apg ii classification were placed in separate orders by cronquist, the polygalaceae within its own order, the polygalales, and the quillajaceae and surianaceae within the rosales.
the fabaceae, as the third-largest plant family in the world, contain most of the diversity of the fabales, the other families making up a comparatively small portion of the order's diversity. research in the order is largely focused on the fabaceae, due in part to its great biological diversity, and to its importance as food plants. the polygalaceae are fairly well researched among plant families, in part due to the large diversity of the genus "polygala", and other members of the family being food plants for various lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. while taxonomists using molecular phylogenetic techniques find strong support for the order, questions remain about the morphological relationships of the quillajaceae and surianaceae to the rest of the order, due in part to limited research on these families.
the fabales are a cosmopolitan order of plants, except only the subfamily papilionoideae (faboideae) of the fabaceae are well dispersed throughout the northern part of the north temperate zone.

five-card draw (also known as a cantrell draw) is a poker variant that is considered the simplest variant of poker, and is the basis for video poker. as a result, it is often the first variant learned by new players. it is commonly played in home games but rarely played in casino and tournament play. the variant is also offered by some online venues, although it is not as popular as other variants such as seven-card stud and texas hold 'em.
in casino play the first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big blind, and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left. home games typically use an ante; the first betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left, and the second round begins with the player who opened the first round.
play begins with each player being dealt five cards, one at a time, all face down. the remaining deck is placed aside, often protected by placing a chip or other marker on it. players pick up the cards and hold them in their hands, being careful to keep them concealed from the other players, then a round of betting occurs.
if more than one player remains after the first round, the "draw" phase begins. each player specifies how many of their cards they wish to replace and discards them. the deck is retrieved, and each player is dealt in turn from the deck the same number of cards they discarded so that each player again has five cards.
a second "after the draw" betting round occurs beginning with the player to the dealer's left or else beginning with the player who opened the first round (the latter is common when antes are used instead of blinds). this is followed by a showdown, if more than one player remains, in which the player with the best hand wins the pot.
a common "house rule" in some places is that a player may not replace more than three cards, unless they draw four cards while keeping an ace (or wild card). this rule is useful for low-stakes social games where many players will stay for the draw, and will help avoid depletion of the deck. in more serious games such as those played in casinos it is unnecessary and generally not used. however, a rule used by many casinos is that a player is not allowed to draw five consecutive cards from the deck. in this case, if a player wishes to replace all five of their cards, that player is given four of them in turn, the other players are given their draws, and then the dealer returns to that player to give the fifth replacement card; if no other player draws it is necessary to deal a burn card first.
another common house rule is that the bottom card of the deck is never given as a replacement, to avoid the possibility of someone who might have seen it during the deal using that information. if the deck is depleted during the draw before all players have received their replacements, the last players can receive cards chosen randomly from among those discarded by previous players. for example, if the last player to draw wants three replacements but there are only two cards remaining in the deck, the dealer gives the player the one top card he can give, then shuffles together the bottom card of the deck, the burn card, and the earlier players' discards (but not the player's own discards), and finally deals two more replacements to the last player.
the sample deal is being played by four players as shown to the right with alice dealing. all four players ante $1. alice deals five cards to each player and places the deck aside.
bob opens the betting round by betting $5. carol folds, david calls, and alice calls, closing the betting round.
bob now declares that he wishes to replace three of his cards, so he removes those three cards from his hand and discards them. alice retrieves the deck, deals a burn card, then deals three cards directly to bob, who puts them in his hand. david discards one card, and alice deals one card to him from the deck. alice now discards three of her own cards, and replaces them with three from the top of the deck (note: in a player-dealt casino game there is often a rule that the dealer must discard before picking up the deck, but this is a home game so we won't worry about such details).
now a second betting round begins. bob checks, david checks, alice bets $10, bob folds, david raises $16, and alice calls, ending the second betting round and going directly into a showdown. david shows a flush, and alice shows two pair, so david takes the pot.
five-card draw is sometimes played with a stripped deck. this variant is commonly known as "seven-to-ace" or "ace-to-seven" (abbreviated as a-7 or 7-a). it can be played by up to five players. when four or fewer players play, a normal 32-card deck without jokers, with ranks ranging from ace to seven, is used. with five players, the sixes are added to make a 36-card deck. the deck thus contains only eight or nine different card ranks, compared to 13 in a standard deck. this affects the probabilities of making specific hands, so a flush ranks above a full house and below four of a kind. many smaller online poker rooms, such as boss media, spread the variant, although it is unheard of in land casinos.

flaming is the online act of posting insults, often laced with profanity or other offensive language on social networking sites. this term should not be confused with the term trolling, which is the act of someone going online, or in person, and causing discord. flaming emerged out of the anonymity that internet forums provide cover for users to act more aggressively. anonymity can lead to disinhibition, which results in the swearing, offensive, and hostile language characteristic of flaming. lack of social cues, less accountability of face-to-face communications, textual mediation and deindividualization are also likely factors. deliberate flaming is carried out by individuals known as flamers, which are specifically motivated to incite flaming. these users specialize in flaming and target specific aspects of a controversial conversation.
while these behaviors may be typical or expected in certain types of forums, they can have dramatic, adverse effects in others. flame wars can have a lasting impact on some internet communities where even once a flame war has concluded a division or even dissolution may occur.
social researchers have investigated flaming, coming up with several different theories about the phenomenon. these include deindividuation and reduced awareness of other people's feelings (online disinhibition effect), conformance to perceived norms, miscommunication caused by the lack of social cues available in face-to-face communication, and anti-normative behavior.
jacob borders, in discussing participants' internal modeling of a discussion, says:mental models are fuzzy, incomplete, and imprecisely stated. furthermore, within a single individual, mental models change with time, even during the flow of a single conversation. the human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion. as debate shifts, so do the mental models. even when only a single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject. fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open. goals are different but left unstated. it is little wonder that compromise takes so long. and even when consensus is reached, the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and programs that fail. the human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the consequences implied by a mental model. a mental model may be correct in structure and assumptions but, even so, the human mind—either individually or as a group consensus—is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future.thus, online conversations often involve a variety of assumptions and motives unique to each individual user. without social context, users are often helpless to know the intentions of their counterparts. in addition to the problems of conflicting mental models often present in online discussions, the inherent lack of face-to-face communication online can encourage hostility. professor norman johnson, commenting on the propensity of internet posters to flame one another, states:the literature suggests that, compared to face-to-face, the increased incidence of flaming when using computer-mediated communication is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues, which decrease individuals' concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals. when social identity and ingroup status are salient, computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context (and associated norms) rather than themselves.a lack of social context creates an element of anonymity, which allows users to feel insulated from the forms of punishment they might receive in a more conventional setting. johnson identifies several precursors to flaming between users, whom he refers to as "negotiation partners," since internet communication typically involves back-and-forth interactions similar to a negotiation. flaming incidents usually arise in response to a perception of one or more negotiation partners being unfair. perceived unfairness can include a lack of consideration for an individual's vested interests, unfavorable treatment (especially when the flamer has been considerate of other users), and misunderstandings aggravated by the inability to convey subtle indicators like non-verbal cues and facial expressions.
there are multiple factors that play into why people would get involved with flaming. for instance, there is the anonymity factor and that people can use different means to have their identity hidden. through the hiding of ones identity people can build a new persona and act in a way that they normally would not when they have their identity known. another factor in flaming is proactive aggression "which is initiated without perceived threat or provocation" and those who are recipients of flaming may counter with flaming of their own and utilize reactive aggression. another factor that goes into flaming are the different communication variables. for instance, offline communications networks can impact the way people act online and can lead them to engage in flaming. finally, there is the factor of verbal aggression and how people who engage in verbal aggression will use those tactics when they engage in flaming online.
evidence of debates which resulted in insults being exchanged quickly back and forth between two parties can be found throughout history. arguments over the ratification of the united states constitution were often socially and emotionally heated and intense, with many attacking one another through local newspapers. such interactions have always been part of literary criticism. for example, ralph waldo emerson's contempt for jane austen's works often extended to the author herself, with emerson describing her as "without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world". in turn, thomas carlyle called emerson a "hoary-headed toothless baboon".
in the modern era, "flaming" was used at east coast engineering schools in the united states as a present participle in a crude expression to describe an irascible individual and by extension to such individuals on the earliest internet chat rooms and message boards. internet flaming was mostly observed in usenet newsgroups although it was known to occur in the wwivnet and fidonet computer networks as well. it was subsequently used in other parts of speech with much the same meaning.
the term "flaming" may originate from "the hacker's dictionary", which in 1983 defined it as ""to speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude"". the meaning of the word has diverged from this definition since then.
jerry pournelle in 1986 explained why he wanted a kill file for bix:
he added, "i noticed something: most of the irritation came from a handful of people, sometimes only one or two. if i could only ignore them, the computer conferences were still valuable. alas, it's not always easy to do".
computer-mediated communication (cmc) research has spent a significant amount of time and effort describing and predicting engagement in uncivil, aggressive online communication. specifically, the literature has described aggressive, insulting behavior as "flaming", which has been defined as hostile verbal behaviors, the uninhibited expression of hostility, insults, and ridicule, and hostile comments directed towards a person or organization within the context of cmc.
flame trolling is the posting of a provocative or offensive message, known as "flamebait", to a public internet discussion group, such as a forum, newsgroup or mailing list, with the intent of provoking an angry response (a "flame") or argument.
posted flamebait can provide the poster with a controlled trigger-and-response setting in which to anonymously engage in conflicts and indulge in aggressive behavior without facing the consequences that such behavior might bring in a face-to-face encounter, a fact parodied in a youtube video by isabel fay. in other instances, flamebait may be used to reduce a forum's use by angering the forum users. in 2012, it was announced that the us state department would start flame trolling jihadists as part of operation viral peace.
among the characteristics of inflammatory behavior, the use of entirely capitalized messages, or the multiple repetition of exclamation marks, along with profanity have been identified as typical.
a flame war results when multiple users engage in provocative responses to an original post—while the original post is sometimes flamebait, this is not always the case. flame wars often draw in many users (including those trying to defuse the flame war) and can overshadow regular forum discussion if left unchecked.
resolving a flame war can be difficult, as it is often hard to determine who is really responsible for the degradation of a reasonable discussion into flame war. someone who posts a contrary opinion in a strongly focused discussion forum may be easily labeled a "baiter", "flamer", or "troll".
flame wars can become intense and can include "death threats, ad hominem invective, and textual amplifiers" but to some sociologists flame wars can actually bring people together. what is bring said in a flame war should not be taken too seriously since the harsh words are a part of flaming.
an approach to resolving a flame war or responding to flaming is to communicate openly with the offending users. acknowledging mistakes, offering to help resolve the disagreement, making clear, reasoned arguments, and even self-deprecation have all been noted as worthwhile strategies to end such disputes. however, others prefer to simply ignore flaming, noting that, in many cases, if the flamebait receives no attention, it will quickly be forgotten as forum discussions carry on. unfortunately, this can motivate trolls to intensify their activities, creating additional distractions.
"taking the bait" or "feeding the troll" refers to someone who responds to the original message regardless of whether they are aware the original message was intended to provoke a response. often when someone takes the bait, others will point this out to them with the acronym "yhbt", which is short for "you have been trolled", or reply with "don't feed the trolls". forum users will usually not give the troll acknowledgement; that just "feeds the troll".
in sociology, history, or any kind of online ethnographic academic study, flame wars as a corpus, in a sts approach of controversies, may be used to understand what is at stake in a community. the idea is that the flame war drives the actors into abandoning a polite stance and forces them to engage into debate and to unveil otherwise concealed arguments. in this respect, the most interesting parts of an online corpus are the flame wars as "outbursts of heated, short and dense debates, in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages".
political flaming typically occur when people have their views challenged and they seek to have their anger known. through the covering of one's identity people may be more likely to engage in political flaming. in a 2015 study conducted by hutchens, cicchirillo, and hmielowski, they found that "those who were more experienced with political discussions -either online or offline- were more likely to indicate they would respond with a flame" and they also found that verbal aggression also played a role in a person engaging in political flaming.
any subject of a polarizing nature can feasibly cause flaming. as one would expect in the medium of the internet, technology is a common topic. the perennial debates between users of competing operating systems, such as windows, classic mac os and macos, or the gnu/linux operating system and ios or android operating system, users of intel and amd processors, and users of the wii u, playstation 4 and xbox one video game systems, often escalate into seemingly unending "flame wars", also called software wars. as each successive technology is released, it develops its own outspoken fan base, allowing arguments to begin anew.
popular culture continues to generate large amounts of flaming and countless flame wars across the internet, such as the constant debates between fans of "star trek" and "star wars". ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate.
in 2005, author anne rice became involved in a flame war of sorts on the review boards of online retailer amazon.com after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel. rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response, which was quickly met with more feedback from users.
in 2007, tech expert kathy sierra was a victim of flaming as an image of her depicted as a mutilated body was spread around online forums. in addition to the doctored photo being spread virally, her social security number and home address were made public as well. consequently, sierra effectively gave up her technology career in response to the ensuing harassment and threats that she received as a result of the flaming.
in november 2007, the popular audio-visual discussion site avs forum temporarily closed its hd dvd and blu-ray discussion forums because of, as the site reported, "physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action" between advocates of the rival formats.
the 2016 presidential election, saw a flame war take place between republican candidate donald trump and the democratic candidate hillary clinton. the barbs exchanged between the two was highly publicized and is an example of political flaming and a flame war.
flaming varies in severity and as such so too does the reaction of states in imposing any sort of sanction. laws vary from country to country, but in most cases, constant flaming can be considered cyber harassment, which can result in internet service provider action to prevent access to the site being flamed. however, as social networks become more and more closely connected to people and their real life, the more harsh words may be considered defamation of the person. for instance, a south korean identity verification law was created to help control flaming and to stop "malicious use of the internet" but opponents to the law argue that the law infringes on the right to free speech.

frank lloyd wright (june 8, 1867 – april 9, 1959) was an american architect, interior designer, writer, and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed. wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. this philosophy was best exemplified by fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of american architecture." his creative period spanned more than 70 years.
wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the prairie school movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the usonian home in broadacre city, his unique vision for urban planning in the united states. in addition to his houses, wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other structures. he often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and stained glass. wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the united states and europe. wright was recognized in 1991 by the american institute of architects as "the greatest american architect of all time."
his colorful personal life often made headlines, notably for leaving his first wife, catherine lee "kitty" tobin for mamah borthwick cheney, the murders at his taliesin estate in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife miriam noel, and his relationship with olga (olgivanna) lazovich hinzenburg, who became his third wife in 1928.
frank lloyd wright was born frank lincoln wright in the farming town of richland center, wisconsin, united states, in 1867. his father, william cary wright (1825–1904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister. wright's mother, anna lloyd jones (1838/39–1923), met william cary wright while working as a county school teacher when william was the superintendent of schools for richland county.
originally from massachusetts, william wright had been a baptist minister, but he later joined his wife's family in the unitarian faith. anna was a member of the well-known lloyd jones family who had emigrated from wales to spring green, wisconsin. one of anna's brothers was jenkin lloyd jones, an important figure in the spread of the unitarian faith in the midwest. both of wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.
according to wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. she decorated his nursery with engravings of english cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition. in 1870, the family moved to weymouth, massachusetts, where william ministered to a small congregation.
in 1876, anna visited the centennial exhibition in philadelphia, where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by friedrich wilhelm august fröbel. the blocks, known as froebel gifts, were the foundation of his innovative kindergarten curriculum. anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young wright spent much time playing. the blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. in his autobiography, wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: "for several years, i sat at the little kindergarten table-top… and played… with the cube, the sphere and the triangle—these smooth wooden maple blocks… all are in my fingers to this day… " many of wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.
the wright family struggled financially in weymouth and returned to spring green, where the supportive lloyd jones clan could help william find employment. they settled in madison, where william taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed unitarian society. although william was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of johann sebastian bach, with his children.
soon after wright turned 14, his parents separated. anna had been unhappy for some time with william's inability to provide for his family and asked him to leave. the divorce was finalized in 1885 after william sued anna for lack of physical affection. william left wisconsin after the divorce, and wright claimed he never saw his father again. at this time he changed his middle name from lincoln to lloyd in honor of his mother's family, the lloyd joneses.
wright attended madison high school; it is unknown if he graduated. in 1886 he was admitted to the university of wisconsin–madison as a special student. while there, wright joined phi delta theta fraternity, took classes part-time for two semesters, and worked with allan d. conover, a professor of civil engineering. wright left the school without taking a degree, although he was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the university in 1955.
in 1887, wright arrived in chicago in search of employment. as a result of the devastating great chicago fire of 1871 and a population boom, new development was plentiful. wright later recalled that while his first impressions of chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a draftsman with the architectural firm of joseph lyman silsbee. wright previously collaborated with silsbee—accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor—on the 1886 unity chapel for wright's family in spring green. while with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: all souls church in chicago for his uncle, jenkin lloyd jones, and the hillside home school i in spring green for two of his aunts. other draftsmen who worked for silsbee in 1887 included future architects cecil corwin, george w. maher, and george g. elmslie. wright soon befriended corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.
feeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a designer at the firm of beers, clay, and dutton. however, wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to joseph silsbee—this time with a raise in salary. although silsbee adhered mainly to victorian and revivalist architecture, wright found his work to be more "gracefully picturesque" than the other "brutalities" of the period. wright aspired for more progressive work.
wright learned that the chicago firm of adler & sullivan was "looking for someone to make the finished drawings for the interior of the auditorium building". wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of louis sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official apprentice in the firm. wright did not get along well with sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. for that matter, sullivan showed very little respect for his employees, as well. in spite of this, "sullivan took [wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility." as an act of respect, wright would later refer to sullivan as "lieber meister" (german for "dear master"). he also formed a bond with office foreman paul mueller. wright later engaged mueller to build several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.
on june 1, 1889, wright married his first wife, catherine lee "kitty" tobin (1871–1959). the two had met around a year earlier during activities at all souls church. sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting wright a five-year employment contract. wright made one more request: "mr. sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?" with sullivan's $5,000 loan, wright purchased a lot at the corner of chicago and forest avenues in the suburb of oak park. the existing gothic revival house was given to his mother, while a compact shingle style house was built alongside for wright and catherine.
by 1890, wright had an office next to sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman george elmslie, who had been hired by sullivan at wright's request. wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. as a general rule, the firm of adler & sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. he later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian robert twombly) suggests that sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from sullivan's sketches. during this time, wright worked on sullivan's bungalow (1890) and the james a. charnley bungalow (1890) in ocean springs, mississippi, the berry-macharg house, james a. charnley house (both 1891), and the louis sullivan house (1892), all in chicago.
despite sullivan's loan and overtime salary, wright was constantly short on funds. wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. to supplement his income and repay his debts, wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. these "bootlegged" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable queen anne and colonial revival styles. nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional cantilevers, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. eight of these early houses remain today, including the thomas gale, robert parker, george blossom, and walter gale houses.
as with the residential projects for adler & sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a frank lloyd wright design. this particular house, built for allison harlan, was only blocks away from sullivan's townhouse in the chicago community of kenwood. aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony tracery in the same style as the charnley house likely gave away wright's involvement. since wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from sullivan's firm. several stories recount the break in the relationship between sullivan and wright; even wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. in "an autobiography", wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. when sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue wright the deed to his oak park house until after he completed his five years. wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. he "threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the adler & sullivan office never to return." dankmar adler, who was more sympathetic to wright's actions, later sent him the deed. however, wright told his taliesin apprentices (as recorded by edgar tafel) that sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the harlan house. tafel also recounted that wright had cecil corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that wright was aware of their illegal nature. regardless of the correct series of events, wright and sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.
after leaving louis sullivan's firm, wright established his own practice on the top floor of the sullivan-designed schiller building on randolph street in chicago. wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of adler & sullivan. although cecil corwin followed wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.
in 1896, wright moved out of the schiller building and into the nearby and newly completed steinway hall building. the loft space was shared with robert c. spencer, jr., myron hunt, and dwight h. perkins. these young architects, inspired by the arts and crafts movement and the philosophies of louis sullivan, formed what became known as the prairie school. they were joined by perkins' apprentice, marion mahony, who in 1895 transferred to wright's team of drafters and took over production of his presentation drawings and watercolor renderings. mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the u.s., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for wright's houses. between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading prairie school architects and many of wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of steinway hall.
wright's projects during this period followed two basic models. his first independent commission, the winslow house, combined sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. the francis apartments (1895, demolished 1971), heller house (1896), rollin furbeck house (1897) and husser house (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. for his more conservative clients, wright designed more traditional dwellings. these included the dutch colonial revival style bagley house (1894), tudor revival style moore house i (1895), and queen anne style charles e. roberts house (1896). while wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional sullivan-inspired details.
soon after the completion of the winslow house in 1894, edward waller, a friend and former client, invited wright to meet chicago architect and planner daniel burnham. burnham had been impressed by the winslow house and other examples of wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the école des beaux-arts and two years in rome. to top it off, wright would have a position in burnham's firm upon his return. in spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, wright declined the offer. burnham, who had directed the classical design of the world's columbian exposition, was a major proponent of the beaux arts movement, thought that wright was making a foolish mistake. yet for wright, the classical education of the école lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern american architecture.
wright relocated his practice to his home in 1898 to bring his work and family lives closer. this move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in oak park or neighboring river forest. the birth of three more children prompted wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive studio addition to the north of the main house. the space, which included a hanging balcony within the two-story drafting room, was one of wright's first experiments with innovative structure. the studio embodied wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.
by 1901, wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in oak park. as his son john lloyd wright wrote: "william eugene drummond, francis barry byrne, walter burley griffin, albert chase mcarthur, marion mahony, isabel roberts, and george willis were the draftsmen. five men, two women. they wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. the men wore their hair like papa, all except albert, he didn't have enough hair. they worshiped papa! papa liked them! i know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern american architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!"
between 1900 and 1901, frank lloyd wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the "prairie style". two, the hickox and bradley houses, were the last transitional step between wright's early designs and the prairie creations. meanwhile, the thomas house and willits house received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style. at the same time, wright gave his new ideas for the american house widespread awareness through two publications in the "ladies' home journal". the articles were in response to an invitation from the president of curtis publishing company, edward bok, as part of a project to improve modern house design. "a home in a prairie town" and "a small house with lots of room in it" appeared respectively in the february and july 1901 issues of the journal. although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years. wright came to buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the darwin d. martin house in 1904. other wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the prairie style are the frederick robie house in chicago and the avery and queene coonley house in riverside, illinois. the robie house, with its soaring, cantilevered roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. with this and other buildings, included in the publication of the wasmuth portfolio (1910), wright's work became known to european architects and had a profound influence on them after world war i. it is sometimes called the "cornerstone of modernism".
wright's residential designs of this era were known as "prairie houses" because the designs complemented the land around chicago. prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: one or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials—especially stone and wood.
by 1909 wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class prairie style single-family house model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture. wright went to europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to berlin publisher ernst wasmuth. "studies and executed buildings of frank lloyd wright", published in 1911, was the first major exposure of wright's work in europe. the work contained more than 100 lithographs of wright's designs, and is commonly known as the wasmuth portfolio.
wright designed the house of cornell's chapter of alpha delta phi literary society (1900), the hillside home school, built for his aunts in spring green, wisconsin (1902) and the unity temple (1905) in oak park, illinois. as a lifelong unitarian and member of unity temple, wright offered his services to the congregation after their church burned down, working on the building from 1905 to 1909. wright later said that unity temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. other early notable public buildings included the larkin administration building (1905) as well as the geneva inn (lake geneva, wisconsin, 1911), the midway gardens (chicago, illinois, 1913), the banff national park pavilion (alberta, canada, 1914), and the imperial hotel (tokyo, 1922).
in the early 1920s, wright designed a "textile" concrete block system reinforced by an internal system of bars. the system of precast blocks, he wrote, enabled "fabrication as infinite in color, texture, and variety as in that rug." wright first used his textile block system on the millard house in pasadena , california, in 1923. the ennis house is now used in films, television, and print media to represent the future. typically wrightian is the joining of the structure to its site by a series of terraces that reach out into and reorder the landscape, making it an integral part of the architect's vision. with the ennis house and the samuel freeman house (both 1923), wright had further opportunities to test the limits of the textile block system, including limited use in the arizona biltmore hotel in 1927. wright's son, lloyd wright, supervised construction for the storer, freeman and ennis houses. architectural historian thomas hines has suggested that lloyd's contribution to these projects is often overlooked.
after world war ii, wright updated the concrete block system, calling it the "usonian automatic" system, resulting in the construction of several notable homes. as he explained in "the natural house" (1954), "the original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.”
in 1903, while wright was designing a house for edwin cheney (a neighbor in oak park), he took a liking to cheney's wife, mamah. mamah borthwick cheney was a modern woman with interests outside the home. she was an early feminist, and wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. the two fell in love, and they became the talk of the town, as they often could be seen taking rides in wright's automobile through oak park. his family had grown to six children, but wright was not parental and he relied on his wife to care for them. wright's wife, "kitty" (nee catherine tobin), sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce.
in 1909, wright and mamah cheney met up in europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. wright remained in europe for almost a year and set up home first in florence, italy—where he lived with his eldest son lloyd—and later in fiesole, italy, where he lived with mamah. during this time, edwin cheney granted mamah a divorce, though kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. after wright returned to the united states in october 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in spring green, wisconsin. the land, bought on april 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the lloyd-joneses. wright began to build himself a new home, which he called , by may 1911. the recurring theme of also came from his mother's side: in welsh mythology was a poet, magician, and priest. the family motto, """" ("the truth against the world"), was taken from the welsh poet , who also had a son named taliesin. the motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the in wales.
on august 15, 1914, while wright was working in chicago, julian carlton, a male servant from barbados, who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned. the dead included mamah; her two children, john and martha cheney; a gardener (david lindblom); a draftsman (emil brodelle); a workman (thomas brunker); and another workman's son (ernest weston). two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, william weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. carlton swallowed hydrochloric acid immediately following the attack in an attempt to kill himself. he was nearly lynched on the spot, but was taken to the dodgeville jail. carlton died from starvation seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.
in 1922, kitty wright finally granted wright a divorce. under the terms of the divorce, wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, maude "miriam" noel. in 1923, wright's mother, anna (lloyd jones) wright, died. wright wed miriam noel in november 1923, but her addiction to morphine led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. in 1924, after the separation, but while still married, wright met olga (olgivanna) lazovich hinzenburg at a petrograd ballet performance in chicago. they moved in together at taliesin in 1925, and soon olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, iovanna, born on december 2, 1925.
on april 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at taliesin. crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of japanese prints that wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000. wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home "taliesin iii".
in 1926, olga's ex-husband, vlademar hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, svetlana. in october 1926, wright and olgivanna were accused of violating the mann act and arrested in tonka bay, minnesota. the charges were later dropped.
wright and miriam noel's divorce was finalized in 1927, wright was again required to wait for one year before remarrying. wright and olgivanna married in 1928.
in 1932, wright and his wife olgivanna put out a call for students to come to taliesin to study and work under wright while they learned architecture and spiritual development. (olgivanna wright had been a student of g. i. gurdjieff). twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed.
considerable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment. the fellowship has evolved into what is now the frank lloyd wright school of architecture, an accredited school. wright was reputedly a difficult person to work with. one apprentice wrote: "he is devoid of consideration and has a blind spot regarding others' qualities. yet i believe, that a year in his studio would be worth any sacrifice."
wright is responsible for a series of concepts of suburban development united under the term broadacre city. he proposed the idea in his book "the disappearing city" in 1932, and unveiled a model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. concurrent with the development of broadacre city, also referred to as usonia, wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the usonian house. although an early version of the form can be seen in the malcolm willey house (1934) in minneapolis, the usonian ideal emerged most completely in the herbert and katherine jacobs first house (1937) in madison, wisconsin. designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a "sandwich" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper—a significant change from typically framed walls. usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.
usonian houses were wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most american households. by developing homes with progressively more open plans, wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room. as in the prairie houses, usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. the conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the prairie ideal. the built-in furnishings related to the arts and crafts movement's principles which influenced wright's early work. spatially and in terms of their construction, the usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a wright-designed house at relatively low cost. his usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers. many features of modern american homes date back to wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.
"fallingwater", one of wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for mr. and mrs. edgar j. kaufmann, sr., at mill run, pennsylvania. constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. the house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home. the construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using limestone for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. the house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. it was one of wright's most expensive pieces. kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. they were overruled by wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. in 1994, robert silman and associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. in the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. in march 2002, post-tensioning of the lowest terrace was completed.
taliesin west, wright's winter home and studio complex in scottsdale, arizona, was a laboratory for wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. now the home of the frank lloyd wright foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the frank lloyd wright school of architecture.
wright turned 80 shortly after world war ii ended, yet remained busy. the solomon r. guggenheim museum in new york city occupied wright for 16 years (1943–1959) and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. the building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on fifth avenue; its interior is similar to the inside of a seashell. its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. however, when the museum was completed, a number of details of wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.
the only realized skyscraper designed by wright is the price tower, a 19-story tower in bartlesville, oklahoma. it is also one of the two existing vertically oriented wright structures (the other is the s.c. johnson wax research tower in racine, wisconsin). the price tower was commissioned by harold c. price of the h. c. price company, a local oil pipeline and chemical firm. on march 29, 2007, price tower was designated a national historic landmark by the united states department of the interior, one of only 20 such properties in oklahoma.
monona terrace, originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for madison, wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. the "as-built" design was carried out by wright's apprentice tony puttnam. monona terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.
florida southern college, located in lakeland, florida, constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) frank lloyd wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the child of the sun project. it is the world's largest single-site collection of frank lloyd wright architecture.
his prairie houses use themed, coordinated design elements (often based on plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets, and other fittings. he made innovative use of new building materials such as precast concrete blocks, glass bricks, and zinc cames (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used pyrex glass tubing as a major element in the johnson wax headquarters. wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). in 1897, wright received a patent for "prism glass tiles" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior. wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. according to wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. to unify the house to its site, wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors. glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. in 1928, wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds. one of wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. by using this large amount of glass, wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. arguably, wright's best-known art glass is that of the prairie style. the simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.
wright also designed some of his own clothing. his fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. he had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a stoddard-dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. during the cash-strapped depression, wright drove cheaper vehicles. some of his last cars in the 1950s included four volkswagens and a chevrolet nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a jaguar mark vii. he owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.
wright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the american institute of architects during his career, going so far as to call the organization "a harbor of refuge for the incompetent," and "a form of refined gangsterism." when an associate referred to him as "an old amateur" wright confirmed, "i am the oldest." wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:
he also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the prairie school architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates. as with any architect, though, wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. in his earlier days, wright worked with some of the top architects of the chicago school, including sullivan. in his prairie school days, wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including william eugene drummond, john van bergen, isabel roberts, francis barry byrne, albert mcarthur, marion mahony griffin, and walter burley griffin.
the czech-born architect antonin raymond, recognized as the father of modern architecture in japan, worked for wright at taliesin and led the construction of the imperial hotel in tokyo. he subsequently stayed in japan and opened his own practice. rudolf schindler also worked for wright on the imperial hotel. his own work is often credited as influencing wright's usonian houses. schindler's friend richard neutra also worked briefly for wright and became an internationally successful architect.
later, in the taliesin days, wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as aaron green, john lautner, e. fay jones, henry klumb, and paolo soleri.
frank lloyd wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. his commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. he had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.
his thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for charles e. roberts entitled the "quadruple block plan." this design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. the houses, which used the same design as published in "a home in a prairie town" from the "ladies' home journal", were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. this also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. although this plan was never realized, wright published the design in the "wasmuth portfolio" in 1910.
the more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the city club of chicago land development competition in 1913. the contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. this design expanded on the quadruple block plan and included several social levels. the design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the blue collar homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. the design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc. this view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical broadacre city design. the philosophy behind his community planning was decentralization. the new development must be away from the cities. in this decentralized america, all services and facilities could coexist "factories side by side with farm and home."
notable community planning designs:
though most famous as an architect, wright was an active dealer in japanese art, primarily "ukiyo-e" woodblock prints. he frequently served as both architect and art dealer to the same clients; he designed a home, then provided the art to fill it. for a time, wright made more from selling art than from his work as an architect. wright was also an avid collector of japanese prints and used them as teaching aids with his apprentices in what were called "print parties".
wright first traveled to japan in 1905, where he bought hundreds of prints. the following year, he helped organize the world's first retrospective exhibition of works by hiroshige, held at the art institute of chicago. for many years, he was a major presence in the japanese art world, selling a great number of works to prominent collectors such as john spaulding of boston, and to prominent museums such as the metropolitan museum of art in new york. he penned a book on japanese art in 1912.
in 1920, however, rival art dealers began to spread rumors that wright was selling retouched prints; this, combined with wright's tendency to live beyond his means, and other factors, led to great financial troubles for the architect. though he provided his clients with genuine prints as replacements for those he was accused of retouching, this marked the end of the high point of his career as an art dealer. he was forced to sell off much of his art collection in 1927 to pay off outstanding debts; the bank of wisconsin claimed his taliesin home the following year, and sold thousands of his prints, for only one dollar a piece, to collector edward burr van vleck.
wright continued to collect and deal in prints until his death in 1959, using prints as collateral for loans, often relying upon his art business to remain financially solvent.
the extent of his dealings in japanese art went largely unknown, or underestimated, among art historians for decades until, in 1980, julia meech, then associate curator of japanese art at the metropolitan museum, began researching the history of the museum's collection of japanese prints. she discovered "a three-inch-deep 'clump of 400 cards' from 1918, each listing a print bought from the same seller—'f. l. wright'" and a number of letters exchanged between wright and the museum's first curator of far eastern art, sigisbert c. bosch reitz, in 1918-22. these discoveries, and subsequent research, led to a renewed understanding of wright's career as an art dealer.
on april 4, 1959, wright was hospitalized for abdominal pains and was operated on april 6. he seemed to be recovering, but he died quietly on april 9. after his death, wright's legacy was plagued with turmoil for years. his third wife olgivanna's dying wish had been that wright, she, and her daughter by her first marriage all be cremated and interred together in a memorial garden being built at taliesin west. according to his own wishes, wright's body had lain in the lloyd-jones cemetery, next to the unity chapel, near taliesin in wisconsin. although olgivanna had taken no legal steps to move wright's remains and against the wishes of other family members, as well as the wisconsin legislature, in 1985, wright's remains were removed from his grave by members of the taliesin fellowship, cremated, and sent to scottsdale, where they were later interred in the memorial garden. the original grave site in wisconsin, now empty, is still marked with wright's name.
after wright's death, most of his archives were stored at the frank lloyd wright foundation in taliesin (in wisconsin), and taliesin west (in arizona). these collections included more than 23,000 architectural drawings, some 44,000 photographs, 600 manuscripts, and more than 300,000 pieces of office and personal correspondence. it also contained about 40 large-scale architectural models, most of which were constructed for moma's retrospective of wright in 1940. in 2012, to guarantee a high level of conservation and access, as well as to transfer the considerable financial burden of maintaining the archive, the frank lloyd wright foundation partnered with the museum of modern art and the avery architectural and fine arts library to move the archive's content to new york. wright's furniture and art collection remains with the foundation, which will also have a role in monitoring the archive. these three parties established an advisory group to oversee exhibitions, symposiums, events, and publications.
photographs and other archival materials are held by the ryerson and burnham libraries at the art institute of chicago. the architect's personal archives are located at taliesin west in scottsdale, arizona. the frank lloyd wright archives include photographs of his drawings, indexed correspondence beginning in the 1880s and continuing through wright's life, and other ephemera. the getty research center, los angeles, also has copies of wright's correspondence and photographs of his drawings in their "frank lloyd wright special collection". wright's correspondence is indexed in "an index to the taliesin correspondence", ed. by professor anthony alofsin, which is available at larger libraries.
wright designed over 400 built structures of which about 300 survive . five have been lost to forces of nature: the waterfront house for w. l. fuller in pass christian, mississippi, destroyed by hurricane camille in august 1969; the louis sullivan bungalow of ocean springs, mississippi, destroyed by hurricane katrina in 2005; and the arinobu fukuhara house (1918) in hakone, japan, destroyed in the 1923 great kantō earthquake. in january 2006, the wilbur wynant house in gary, indiana was destroyed by fire. in 2018 the arch oboler complex in malibu, california was gutted in the woolsey fire.
notable wright buildings intentionally demolished: midway gardens (built 1913, demolished 1929), the larkin administration building (built 1903, demolished 1950), the francis apartments and francisco terrace apartments (chicago, built 1895, demolished 1971 and 1974, respectively), the geneva inn (lake geneva, wisconsin, built 1911, demolished 1970), and the banff national park pavilion (built 1914, demolished 1934). the imperial hotel (built 1923) survived the 1923 great kantō earthquake, but was demolished in 1968 due to urban developmental pressures. the hoffman auto showroom in new york city (built 1954) was demolished in 2013.
later in his life (and after his death in 1959), wright was accorded much honorary recognition for his lifetime achievements. he received a gold medal award from the royal institute of british architects in 1941. the american institute of architects awarded him the aia gold medal in 1949. that medal was a symbolic "burying the hatchet" between wright and the aia. in a radio interview, he commented, "well, the aia i never joined, and they know why. when they gave me the gold medal in houston, i told them frankly why. feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should i join them?" he was awarded the franklin institute's frank p. brown medal in 1953. he received honorary degrees from several universities (including his "alma mater", the university of wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. in 2000, fallingwater was named "the building of the 20th century" in an unscientific "top-ten" poll taken by members attending the aia annual convention in philadelphia. on that list, wright was listed along with many of the usa's other greatest architects including eero saarinen, i.m. pei, louis kahn, philip johnson, and ludwig mies van der rohe; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. the other three buildings were the guggenheim museum, the frederick c. robie house, and the johnson wax building.
in 1992, the madison opera in madison, wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera "shining brow", by composer daron hagen and librettist paul muldoon based on events early in wright's life. the work has since received numerous revivals, including a june 2013 revival at fallingwater, in bull run, pennsylvania, by opera theater of pittsburgh. in 2000, "", a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of wright's life, debuted at the milwaukee repertory theater.
in 1966, the united states postal service honored wright with a prominent americans series 2¢ postage stamp. several of wright's buildings have been proposed by the united states to be unesco world heritage sites.
"so long, frank lloyd wright" is a song written by paul simon. art garfunkel has stated that the origin of the song came from his request that simon write a song about the famous architect frank lloyd wright. simon himself stated that he knew nothing about wright, but proceeded to write the song anyway.
in 1957, arizona made plans to construct a new capitol building. believing that the submitted plans for the new capitol were tombs to the past, frank lloyd wright offered "oasis" as an alternative to the people of arizona.
in 2004, one of the spires included in his design was erected in scottsdale.
the city of scottsdale, arizona renamed a portion of bell road, a major east-west thoroughfare in the phoenix metropolitan area, in honor of frank lloyd wright.
frank lloyd wright was married three times, fathering four sons and three daughters. he also adopted svetlana milanoff, the daughter of his third wife, olgivanna lloyd wright.
his wives were:
his children with catherine were:

filk music is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to science fiction/fantasy/horror fandom and a type of fan labor. the genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s.
the term "filk" (originally a typographical error) predates 1955. (see also below.)
it is used
as interfilk's "what is it?" page demonstrates, there is no consensus on the definition of filk. attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.
filk has been defined as folk music, usually with a science fiction or fantasy theme, but this definition is not exact. filkers have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats. in addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as blues, calypso, and even rock appear from time to time.
filk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at science fiction/fantasy conventions. this definition might be summarized as, "we can argue what it is until we're red or green or blue, but when filkers get together it's the thing we do."
yet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. as described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking. the social aspect of filk as contrasted with the "performer vs. audience" dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by ethnomusicologist dr. sally childs-helton.
by any of these definitions, filk is a form of music created from within science fiction and fantasy fandom, often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in canada, england, germany, and the usa. the boundaries of filking are vague. for example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the society for creative anachronism or at larps.
in keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. while a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from rock, a cappella vocal groups, or other styles. the hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. one of the few rock-style groups in filk has been ookla the mok, whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock. some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it into electronica and hip-hop music such as 76's "objects in space" (an homage to the popular tv show "firefly", which itself featured several filk songs) and dj qbert's "wave twisters."
the range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change. yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). many filk songs (such as leslie fish's "carmen miranda's ghost is haunting space station 3") are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like steve macdonald's "journey's done").
however, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. these are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.
a significant number of filk songs are parodies, whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use. some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the proportion of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.
one subtype of filk songs is the "ose" song, one on themes of death and gloom. the term derives from the word "morose", as in "ose, morose, even-more-ose". a further variant is "cheeri-ose": ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating such a subject lightheartedly; cf. tom lehrer's (non-filk) "irish ballad".
for the first few decades of the occasional science fiction convention, there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of new york fans called the futurians, and were written by fred pohl and cyril kornbluth (see damon knight's book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). with the break up of the city clubs common during the great depression, filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.
in the early 1950s, the term "filk music" started as a misspelling of "folk music" in an essay by lee jacobs, "the influence of science fiction on modern american filk music". wrai ballard, then editor of the spectator amateur press society refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the post office under the comstock laws, but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly; thus, jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions. its first documented deliberate use was by karen anderson in "die zeitschrift für vollständigen unsinn" ("the journal for utter nonsense") #774 (june 1953), for a song written by her husband poul anderson.
the 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music. while many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some remained popular for decades. by the late 1970s, periodicals such as "kantele" and "philk fee-nom-ee-non" offered a ready outlet for filk writers.
at the 1974 world science fiction convention author bob asprin announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the dorsai irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night. in the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with filkcon in chicago in 1979, organized by margaret middleton and curt clemmer, later joined by bayfilk in northern california; the ohio valley filk fest (ovff) in columbus, ohio; conchord in los angeles and in san diego, california; musicon in nashville, tennessee; filkontario near toronto, ontario; a rotating british filkcon, and one (nefilk) in the northeastern us; the german filkcontinental; and others.
these efforts grew to include raising funds for traveling filkers. the first was a british filk fund. then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in north america created interfilk, which is now the most active traveling filker fund. beginning with british filker mike whitaker in 1992, 40 filkers were the beneficiaries of interfilk subsidies in its first decade. ovff began presenting the pegasus award annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and filkontario started the filk hall of fame in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.
after years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s. these included "folk songs for folk who ain't been yet", featuring leslie fish and friends, and "children of the future" by karen willson.
off centaur publications was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. as the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.
e-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. in the late 1980s, california filker kay shapero created the filk group on the fidonet hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. the later creation of other electronic forums — the usenet group, a united kingdom e-mail list filk_uk and the german language list, an irc channel devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on livejournal (including a livejournal community), to pick a few examples — have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). the availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. a few years into the 21st century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.
on the album "precious friend", pete seeger and arlo guthrie perform "old time religion", in a filk version. most of the verses of this version were by gordon dickson; when seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to dickson.
filk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a "filk circle". similar to the drum circles and bardic circles found at sca events and other fannish events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.
filk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. the purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. in a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both. performers may know only one song, or may know an extensive library of songs. participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.
filk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. local parties called "housefilks" are day-long events in which a single filk circle performs in the host's home.
as the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed. the details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. the purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: by having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.
a formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. a circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small must enlarge as the number of participants grows. the disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle, space permitting.
traditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night. of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel to have space available for the entire night. there are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example, to allow participants to get home to sleep.
at most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.
a wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the acoustic guitar. acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable keyboards and even theremins are not unheard of. small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small drum kits and upright basses can be found at some filk circles. a large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and celtic instruments such as fiddles, mandolins, dulcimers, banjos, flutes, recorders, bodhráns, bongos and darbukas.
songs are presented very informally. they can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed a cappella. songs can be original songs, covers, parodies, instrumentals, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.
an active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.
filk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. there are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.
in a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any) goes in turn, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. each participant is given the choice of "pick, pass, or play". "pick" means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. "pass" means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. "play" means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.
the advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure, which enforces politeness. it ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. there are disadvantages, however. a bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. such a circle was lamented in a filk by suzette haden elgin: "i've been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night." there is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good "follower" song is reduced.
in a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. frequently the word "follower!" is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.
the chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. "runs" of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. the disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort to be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: it's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention. one countermeasure to such conflicts is for someone, generally not one of the current/starting-up performers, to shout "filker up!", possibly pointing to the one being interrupted. this alerts the room, and specifically the (usually unintentional) interrupter, to be quiet and pay attention to the filker who has started performing.
a token bardic circle, also known as a "poker-chip" bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. a container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see "bardic", above). when all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.
the advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. the disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.
there are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. a given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. it's common to see the participants of a bardic circle "go chaos" or vice versa, for example.
the etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. no one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.
although singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like jam sessions. jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. the exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.
disruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. this includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. if between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout "filker up!" as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.
there are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.
at a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. when accepting induction into the filk hall of fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist sally childs-helton said, "we have taken our right to be creative and to literally "play" in the best sense of that word." filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand—a dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. the eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (see for example leslie fish's hope eyrie.) while there are significant numbers of memorial songs, pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely american optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to nye, 1996).
within the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. the repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. whether the occasion is a housefilk in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.
that openness to participation is a marked norm in filking, which makes it unusual in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts. mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.
occasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. newsgroup debates over such topics as whether 'weird al' yankovic is a filker suggest the deep feelings involved. in practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered found filk.
the pegasus awards were founded to recognize and honor excellence in filking. these awards are given annually at the ohio valley filk fest (or ovff). anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. it is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.
currently awards are given in six categories: best song, best performer, best writer/composer, best classic song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. some examples of past categories include: best love song, best literature song, best techie song, best sing along, etc.
the ovff convention committee solicits nominations for finalists for the pegasus awards (the nominating ballot) during the late spring and summer. there is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the nominating ballot. the finalist ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of ovff. voting can be done online—either to nominate finalists, or to vote for the finalists themselves. the final round of voting happens at ovff itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual pegasus concert. the entire process is administered by the ovff convention committee.
the filk hall of fame was created by david hayman in 1995 as a complement to the pegasus awards. while the pegasus awards acknowledge writing and performing, and therefore often reflect who or what is currently popular, the hall of fame was intentionally designed to acknowledge long-term or lasting contributions, including those largely behind the scenes.
anyone may make a nomination. a nomination consists of a description of what the nominee has contributed to filk music and the filk community. nominations are reviewed annually by a jury consisting of the convention committee of filkontario (with the exception of david hayman, who serves as administrator) and a representative from the committees of each of that year's other filk conventions. the jury members vote independently by secret ballot, and thereby select that year's inductees. typically, three people are inducted each year, at the banquet at filkontario. a small editorial committee combines and edits the text of the nomination(s) to produce a citation, which is read aloud at the banquet, presented to the inductee along with a plaque, and posted on the hall of fame web site.

a frisbee (pronounced , origin of the term dates to 1957, also called a flying disc or simply a disc) is a gliding toy or sporting item that is generally plastic and roughly in diameter with a pronounced lip. it is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in flying disc games. the shape of the disc is an airfoil in cross-section which allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air. spinning it imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic force, allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance.
a wide range is available of flying disc variants. those for disc golf are usually smaller but denser and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase or decrease stability and distance. the longest recorded disc throw is by david wiggins, jr. with a distance of . disc dog sports use relatively slow-flying discs made of more pliable material to better resist a dog's bite and prevent injury to the dog. flying rings are also available which typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc. illuminated discs are made of phosphorescent plastic or contain chemiluminescent fluid or battery-powered leds for play after dark. others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.
the term "frisbee" is often used generically to describe all flying discs, but frisbee is a registered trademark of the wham-o toy company. this protection results in organized sports such as ultimate or disc golf having to forgo use of the word "frisbee".
humans have been tossing disc-shaped objects since time immemorial. at first these were found objects such as rocks worn smooth in stream beds. some were tossed for fun while others were used as weapons such as the discus. throwing the discus became an event in the olympic games of ancient greece. later, objects such as mats, hats, lids, pie tins, and cake pans were found to be perfect for tossing.
walter frederick morrison and his future wife lucile had fun tossing a popcorn can lid after a thanksgiving day dinner in 1937. they soon discovered a market for a light duty flying disc when they were offered 25 cents for a cake pan that they were tossing back and forth on a beach near los angeles, california. "that got the wheels turning, because you could buy a cake pan for five cents, and if people on the beach were willing to pay a quarter for it, well—there was a business," morrison told "the virginian-pilot" newspaper in 2007.
the morrisons continued their business until world war ii, when he served in the army air force flying p-47s, and then was a prisoner of war. after the war, morrison sketched a design for an aerodynamically improved flying disc that he called the whirlo-way. after the famous racehorse. he and business partner warren franscioni began producing the first plastic discs by 1948, after design modifications and experimentation with several prototypes. they renamed them the flyin-saucer in the wake of reported unidentified flying object-sightings.
"we worked fairs, demonstrating it," morrison told the "virginian-pilot". the two of them once overheard someone saying that the pair were using wires to make the discs hover, so they developed a sales pitch: "the flyin-saucer is free, but the invisible wire is $1." "that's where we learned we could sell these things," he said, because people were enthusiastic about them.
morrison and franscioni ended their partnership in early 1950, and morrison formed his own company in 1954 called american trends to buy and sell flyin saucers, which were being made of a flexible polypropylene plastic by southern california plastics, the original molder. he discovered that he could produce his own disc more cheaply, and he designed a new model in 1955 called the pluto platter, the archetype of all modern flying discs. he sold the rights to wham-o on january 23, 1957. in 1958, morrison was awarded u.s. design patent for his product.
in june 1957, wham-o co-founders richard knerr and arthur "spud" melin gave the disc the brand name "frisbee" after learning that college students were calling the pluto platter by that term, which was derived from the connecticut-based pie manufacturer frisbie pie company, a supplier of pies to yale university where students had started a campus craze tossing empty pie tins stamped with the company's logo—the way that morrison and his wife had in 1937.
the man behind the frisbee's success, however, was southern californian edward headrick, hired in 1964 as wham-o's general manager and vice president of marketing. headrick redesigned the pluto platter by reworking the mold, mainly to remove the names of the planets, but fortuitously increasing the rim thickness and mass in the process, creating a more controllable disc that could be thrown more accurately.
wham-o changed their marketing strategy to promote frisbee use as a new sport, and sales skyrocketed. in 1964, the first professional model went on sale. headrick patented its design; it featured raised ridges (the "rings of headrick") that were claimed to stabilize flight.
headrick became known as the father of frisbee sports; he founded the international frisbee association and appointed dan roddick as its head. roddick began establishing north american series (nas) tournament standards for various frisbee sports, such as freestyle, guts, double disc court, and overall events. headrick later helped to develop the sport of disc golf by inventing standardized targets called "pole holes", that was first played with frisbees and later with more aerodynamic beveled rim discs. when headrick died, he was cremated, and his ashes were molded into memorial discs and given to family and close friends and sold to benefit the ed headrick memorial museum.
the frisbee was inducted into the national toy hall of fame in 1998.
the ift guts competitions in northern michigan, the canadian open frisbee championships (1972), toronto, on, the vancouver open frisbee championships (1974), vancouver, bc, the octad (1974), new jersey, the american flying disc open (1974), rochester, ny and the world frisbee championships (1974), pasadena, ca are the earliest frisbee competitions that presented the frisbee as a new disc sport. before these tournaments, the frisbee was considered a toy and used for recreation.
double disc court was invented and introduced in 1974 by jim palmeri, a sport played with two flying discs and two teams of two players. each team defends its court and tries to land a flying disc in the opposing court.
dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching.
this is a precision and accuracy sport in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target pole hole. in 1926, in bladworth, saskatchewan, canada, ronald gibson and a group of his bladworth elementary school chums played a game using metal lids, they called "tin lid golf." in 1976, the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called "pole holes" invented and developed by wham-o's ed headrick.
in 1974, freestyle competition was created and introduced by ken westerfield and discrafts jim kenner. teams of two or three players are judged as they perform a routine that consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music.
a half-court disc game derived from ultimate, similar to hot box. the object is to advance the disc on the field of play by passing, and score points by throwing the flying disc to a teammate in a small scoring area.
the game of guts was invented by the healy brothers in the 1950s and developed at the international frisbee tournament (ift) in eagle harbor, michigan. two teams of one to five team members stand in parallel lines facing each other across a court and throw flying discs at members of the opposing team.
a patented game scoring points by throwing and deflecting the flying disc and hitting or entering the goal. the game ends when a team scores exactly 21 points or "chogs" the disc for an instant win.
the most widely played disc game began in the late 1960s with joel silver and jared kass. in the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the ultimate players association by dan roddick, tom kennedy and irv kalb. the object of the game is to advance the disc and score points by eventually passing the disc to a team member in the opposing team's end zone. players may not run while holding the disc.

the history of the falkland islands () goes back at least five hundred years, with active exploration and colonisation only taking place in the 18th century. nonetheless, the islands have been a matter of controversy, as they have been claimed by the french, british, spaniards and argentines at various points.
the islands were uninhabited when discovered by europeans. france established a colony on the islands in 1764. in 1765, a british captain claimed the islands for britain. in early 1770 a spanish commander arrived from argentina with five ships and 1400 soldiers forcing the british to leave port egmont. britain and spain almost went to war over the islands, but the british government decided that it should withdraw its presence from many overseas settlements in 1774. spain, which had a garrison at puerto soledad on east falklands, administered the garrison from montevideo until 1811 when it was compelled to withdraw by pressures resulting from the peninsular war. in 1833, the british returned to the falkland islands. argentina invaded the islands on 2 april 1982. the british responded with an expeditionary force that forced the argentines to surrender.
when the world sea level was lower in the ice age, the falkland islands may have been joined to the mainland of south america.
while amerindians from patagonia could have visited the falklands,
the presence of the warrah, "dusicyon australis", has often been cited as evidence of pre-european occupation of the islands. however, in 2009, this hypothesis was disproved when dna analysis identified the falkland island wolf's closest living relative as the maned wolf ("chrysocyon brachyurus") – an unusually long-legged, fox-like south american canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago. it would seem that the lineages of the maned wolf and the falkland islands wolf separated in north america; canids did not appear in south america until roughly 3 million years ago in a paleozoogeographical event called the great american biotic interchange, in which the continents of north and south america were newly connected by the formation of the isthmus of panama. this means it is likely that the warrah arrived in the islands long before humans.
the islands had no native trees when discovered but there is some ambiguous evidence of past forestation, that may be due to wood being transported by oceanic currents from patagonia. all modern trees have been introduced by europeans.
an archipelago in the region of the falkland islands appeared on portuguese maps from the early 16th century. researchers pepper and pascoe cite the possibility that an unknown portuguese expedition may have sighted the islands, based on the existence of a french copy of a portuguese map from 1516. maps from this period show islands known as the "sanson" islands in a position that could be interpreted as the falklands.
sightings of the islands are attributed to ferdinand magellan or estêvão gomes of the "san antonio", one of the captains in the expedition, as the falklands fit the description of those visited to gather supplies. the account given by pigafetta the chronicler of magellan's voyage contradicts attribution to either gomes or magellan, since it describes the position of islands close to the patagonia coast, with the expedition following the mainland coast and the islands visited between a latitude of 49° and 51°s and also refers to meeting "giants" (described as sansón or samsons in the chronicle) who are believed to be the tehuelche indians. although acknowledging that pigafetta's account casts doubt upon the claim, the argentine historian laurio h. destefani asserts it probable that a ship from the magellan expedition discovered the islands citing the difficulty in measuring longitude accurately, which means that islands described as close to the coast could be further away. destefani dismisses attribution to gomes since the course taken by him on his return would not have taken the ships near the falklands.
destefani also attributes an early visit to the falklands by an unknown spanish ship, although destefani's firm conclusions are contradicted by authors who conclude the sightings refer to the beagle channel.
when english explorer john davis, commander of the "desire", one of the ships belonging to thomas cavendish's second expedition to the new world, separated from cavendish off the coast of what is now southern argentina, he decided to make for the strait of magellan in order to find cavendish. on 9 august 1592 a severe storm battered his ship, and davis drifted under bare masts, taking refuge "among certain isles never before discovered". davis did not provide the latitude of these islands, indicating they were 50 leagues away from the patagonian coast (they are actually 75 leagues away). positional errors due to the longitude problem continued to be a problem till the late 19th century, when accurate chronometers were first produced, although destefani asserts the error here to be "unusually large".
in 1594, they may have been visited by english commander richard hawkins, who, combining his own name with that of queen elizabeth i, the "virgin queen", gave a group of islands the name of "hawkins' maidenland". however, the latitude given was off by at least 3 degrees and the description of the shore (including the sighting of bonfires) casts doubts on his discovery. errors in the latitude measured can be attributed to a simple mistake reading a cross staff divided into minutes meaning the latitude measured could be 50° 48'. the description of bonfires can also be attributed to peat fires caused by lightning, which is not uncommon in the outer islands of the falklands in february. in 1925, conor o'brian analysed the voyage of hawkins and concluded that the only land he could have sighted was steeple jason island. the british historian mary cawkell also points out that criticism of the account of hawkins discovery should be tempered by the fact it was written 9 years after the event; hawkins was captured by the spanish and spent 8 years in prison.
on 24 january 1600, the dutchman sebald de weert visited the jason islands and called them the sebald islands (in spanish, "islas sebaldinas" or "sebaldes"). this name remained in use for the entire falkland islands for a long time; william dampier used the name "sibbel de wards" in his reports of his visits in 1684 and 1703, while james cook still referred to the sebaldine islands in the 1770s. the latitude that de weert provided (50° 40') was close enough as to be considered, for the first time beyond doubt, the falkland islands.
english captain john strong, commander of the "welfare", sailed between the two principal islands in 1690 and called the passage "falkland channel" (now falkland sound), after anthony cary, 5th viscount falkland (1656–1694), who as commissioner of the admiralty had financed the expedition and later became first lord of the admiralty. from this body of water the island group later took its collective name.
france established a colony at port st. louis, on east falkland's berkeley sound coast in 1764. the french name "îles malouines" was given to the islands – "malouin" being the adjective for the breton port of saint-malo. the spanish name "islas malvinas" is a translation of the french name of "îles malouines".
in 1765, capt. john byron, who was unaware the french had established port saint louis on east falkland, explored saunders island around west falkland. after discovering a natural harbour, he named the area port egmont and claimed the islands for britain on the grounds of prior discovery. the next year captain john macbride established a permanent british settlement at port egmont.
under the alliance established by the pacte de famille, in 1766 france agreed to leave after the spanish complained about french presence in territories they considered their own. spain agreed to compensate louis de bougainville, the french admiral and explorer who had established the settlement on east falkland at his own expense. in 1767, the spanish formally assumed control of port st. louis and renamed it "puerto soledad" (english: port solitude).
in early 1770 spanish commander, don juan ignacio de madariaga, briefly visited port egmont. on 10 june he returned from argentina with five armed ships and 1400 soldiers forcing the british to leave port egmont. this action sparked the falkland crisis between 10 july 1770 to 22 january 1771 when britain and spain almost went to war over the islands. however conflict was averted when the colony was re-established by captain john stott with the ships , and hms "florida" (a mail ship which had already been at the founding of the original settlement). egmont quickly became an important port-of-call for british ships sailing around cape horn.
however, with the growing economic pressures stemming from the upcoming american war of independence, the british government decided that it should withdraw its presence from many overseas settlements in 1774. on 20 may 1776 the british forces under the command of royal naval lieutenant clayton formally left port egmont, while leaving a plaque asserting britain's continuing sovereignty over the islands. for the next four years, british sealers used egmont as a base for their activities in the south atlantic. this ended in 1780 when they were forced to leave by spanish authorities who then ordered that the british colony be destroyed.
spain, which had a garrison at puerto soledad on east falkland, which was administered from montevideo until 1811 when it withdrew due to the military pressures created by the peninsular war in spain and the growing calls for independence by its colonies in south america. on departure, the spanish also left a plaque proclaiming spain's sovereignty over the islands as the british had done 35 years before.
following the departure of the spanish settlers, the falkland islands became the domain of whalers and sealers who used the islands to shelter from the worst of the south atlantic weather. by merit of their location, the falkland islands have often been the last refuge for ships damaged at sea. most numerous among those using the islands were british and american sealers, where typically between 40 and 50 ships were engaged in exploiting fur seals. this represents an itinerant population of up to 1,000 sailors.
on 8 february 1813 the "isabella", a british ship of 193 tons en route from sydney to london, ran aground off the coast of speedwell island, then known as eagle island. among the ship's 54 passengers and crew, all of whom survived the wreck, was the united irish general and exile joseph holt, who subsequently detailed the ordeal in his memoirs. also aboard had been the heavily pregnant joanna durie, who on 21 feb 1813 gave birth to elizabeth providence durie.
the next day, 22 february 1813, six men who had volunteered to seek help from any nearby spanish outposts that they could find set out in one of the isabella's longboats. braving the south atlantic in a boat little more than , they made landfall on the mainland at the river plate just over a month later. the british gun brig under the command of lieutenant william d'aranda was sent to rescue the survivors.
on 5 april captain charles barnard of the american sealer "nanina" was sailing off the shore of speedwell island, with a discovery boat deployed looking for seals. having seen smoke and heard gunshots the previous day, he was alert to the possibility of survivors of a ship wreck. this suspicion was heightened when the crew of the boat came aboard and informed barnard that they had come across a new moccasin as well as the partially butchered remains of a seal. at dinner that evening, the crew observed a man approaching the ship who was shortly joined by eight to ten others. both barnard and the survivors from the "isabella" had harboured concerns the other party was spanish and were relieved to discover their respective nationalities.
barnard dined with the "isabella" survivors that evening and finding that the british party were unaware of the war of 1812 informed the survivors that technically they were at war with each other. nevertheless, barnard promised to rescue the british party and set about preparations for the voyage to the river plate. realising that they had insufficient stores for the voyage he set about hunting wild pigs and otherwise acquiring additional food. while barnard was gathering supplies, however, the british took the opportunity to seize the "nanina" and departed leaving barnard, along with one member of his own crew and three from the "isabella", marooned. shortly thereafter, the "nancy" arrived from the river plate and encountered the "nanina", whereupon lieutenant d'aranda rescued the erstwhile survivors of the "isabella" and took the "nanina" itself as a prize of war.
barnard and his party survived for eighteen months marooned on the islands until the british whalers "indispensable" and "asp" rescued them in november 1814. the british admiral in rio de janeiro had requested their masters to divert to the area to search for the american crew. in 1829, barnard published an account of his survival entitled "a narrative of the sufferings and adventures of capt charles h. barnard".
in march 1820, the "heroína", a privately owned frigate that was operated as a privateer under a license issued by the united provinces of the river plate, under the command of american colonel david jewett, set sail looking to capture spanish ships as prizes. he captured "carlota", a portuguese ship, which was considered an act of piracy. a storm resulted in severe damage to "heroína" and sank the prize "carlota", forcing jewett to put into puerto soledad for repairs in october 1820.
captain jewett sought assistance from the british explorer james weddell. weddell reported the letter he received from jewett as:
sir, i have the honor of informing you that i have arrived in this port with a commission from the supreme government of the united provinces of the rio de la plata to take possession of these islands on behalf of the country to which they belong by natural law. while carrying out this mission i want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, i invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; i would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other british subject found in the vicinity; i am, respectfully yours. signed, jewett, colonel of the navy of the united provinces of south america and commander of the frigate "heroína".
many modern authors report this letter as representing the declaration issued by jewett.
jewett's ship received weddell's assistance in obtaining anchorage off port louis. weddell reported only 30 seamen and 40 soldiers fit for duty out of a crew of 200, and how jewett slept with pistols over his head following the mutiny. on 6 november 1820, jewett raised the flag of the united provinces of the river plate (a predecessor of modern-day argentina) and claimed possession of the islands. in the words of weddell, "in a few days, he took formal possession of these islands for the patriot government of buenos ayres, read a declaration under their colours, planted on a port in ruins, and fired a salute of twenty-one guns."
jewett departed from the falkland islands in april 1821. in total he had spent no more than six months on the island, entirely at port luis. in 1822, jewett was accused of piracy by a portuguese court, but by that time he was in brazil.
in 1823, the united provinces of the river plate granted fishing rights to jorge pacheco and luis vernet. travelling to the islands in 1824, the first expedition failed almost as soon as it landed, and pacheco chose not to continue with the venture. vernet persisted, but the second attempt, delayed until winter 1826 by a brazilian blockade, was also unsuccessful. the expedition intended to exploit the feral cattle on the islands but the boggy conditions meant the gauchos could not catch cattle in their traditional way. vernet was by now aware of conflicting british claims to the islands and sought permission from the british consulate before departing for the islands.
in 1828, the united provinces government granted vernet all of east falkland including all its resources, and exempted him from taxation if a colony could be established within three years. he took settlers, including british captain matthew brisbane (who had sailed to the islands earlier with weddell), and before leaving once again sought permission from the british consulate in buenos aires. the british asked for a report for the british government on the islands, and vernet asked for british protection should they return.
on 10 june 1829, vernet was designated as 'civil and military commandant' of the islands (no governor was ever appointed) and granted a monopoly on seal hunting rights. a protest was lodged by the british consulate in buenos aires. by 1831, the colony was successful enough to be advertising for new colonists, although the "lexington"'s report suggests that the conditions on the islands were quite miserable. charles darwin's visit in 1833 confirmed the squalid conditions in the settlement, although captain matthew brisbane (vernet's deputy) later claimed that this was the result of the "lexington" raid.
in 1831, vernet attempted to assert his monopoly on seal hunting rights. this led him to capture the american ships "harriet", "superior" and "breakwater". as a reprisal, the united states consul in buenos aires sent captain silas duncan of the uss "lexington" to recover the confiscated property. after finding what he considered proof that at least four american fishing ships had been captured, plundered, and even outfitted for war, duncan took seven prisoners aboard the "lexington" and charged them with piracy.
also taken on board, duncan reported, "were the whole of the (falklands') population consisting of about forty persons, with the exception of some 'gauchos', or cowboys who were encamped in the interior." the group, principally german citizens from buenos aires, "appeared greatly rejoiced at the opportunity thus presented of removing with their families from a desolate region where the climate is always cold and cheerless and the soil extremely unproductive". however, about 24 people did remain on the island, mainly gauchos and several charrúa indians, who continued to trade on vernet's account.
measures were taken against the settlement. the log of the "lexington" reports destruction of arms and a powder store, while settlers remaining later said that there was great damage to private property. towards the end of his life, luis vernet authorised his sons to claim on his behalf for his losses stemming from the raid. in the case lodged against the us government for compensation, rejected by the us government of president cleveland in 1885, vernet stated that the settlement was destroyed.
in the aftermath of the "lexington" incident, major esteban mestivier was commissioned by the buenos aires government to set up a penal colony. he arrived at his destination on 15 november 1832 but his soldiers mutinied and killed him. the mutiny was suppressed by armed sailors from the french whaler "jean jacques", whilst mestivier's widow was taken on board the british sealer "rapid". the "sarandí" returned on 30 december 1832 and major josé maría pinedo took charge of the settlement.
the argentinian assertions of sovereignty provided the spur for britain to send a naval task force in order to finally and permanently return to the islands.
on 3 january 1833, captain james onslow, of the brig-sloop hms "clio", arrived at vernet's settlement at port louis to request that the flag of the united provinces of the river plate be replaced with the british one, and for the administration to leave the islands. while major josé maría pinedo, commander of the schooner "sarandí", wanted to resist, his numerical disadvantage was obvious, particularly as a large number of his crew were british mercenaries who were unwilling to fight their own countrymen. such a situation was not unusual in the newly independent states in latin america, where land forces were strong, but navies were frequently quite undermanned. as such he protested verbally, but departed without a fight on 5 january. argentina claims that vernet's colony was also expelled at this time, though sources from the time appear to dispute this, suggesting that the colonists were encouraged to remain initially under the authority of vernet's storekeeper, william dickson and later his deputy, matthew brisbane.
initial british plans for the islands were based upon the continuation of vernet's settlement at port louis. an argentine immigrant of irish origin, william dickson, was appointed as the british representative and provided with a flagpole and flag to be flown whenever ships were in harbour. in march 1833, vernet's deputy, matthew brisbane returned and presented his papers to captain fitzroy of hms "beagle", which coincidentally happened to be in harbour at the time. fitzroy encouraged brisbane to continue with vernet's enterprise with the proviso that whilst private enterprise was encouraged, argentine assertions of sovereignty would not be welcome.
brisbane reasserted his authority over vernet's settlement and recommenced the practice of paying employees in promissory notes. due to vernet's reduced status, the promissory notes were devalued, which meant that the employees received fewer goods at vernet's stores for their wages. after months of freedom following the "lexington" raid this accentuated dissatisfaction with the leadership of the settlement. in august 1833, under the leadership of antonio rivero, a gang of creole and indian gauchos ran amok in the settlement. armed with muskets obtained from american sealers, the gang killed five members of vernet's settlement including both dickson and brisbane. shortly afterward the survivors fled port louis, seeking refuge on turf island in berkeley sound until rescued by the british sealer 'hopeful' in october 1833.
lt henry smith was installed as the first british resident in january 1834. one of his first actions was to pursue and arrest rivero's gang for the murders committed the previous august. the gang was sent for trial in london but could not be tried as the crown court did not have jurisdiction over the falkland islands. in the british colonial system, colonies had their own, distinct governments, finances, and judicial systems. rivero was not tried and sentenced because the british local government and local judiciary had not yet been installed in 1834; these were created later, by the 1841 british letters patent. subsequently, rivero has acquired the status of a folk hero in argentina, where he is portrayed as leading a rebellion against british rule. ironically it was the actions of rivero that were responsible for the ultimate demise of vernet's enterprise on the falklands.
charles darwin revisited the falklands in 1834; the settlements darwin and fitzroy both take their names from this visit.
after the arrest of rivero, smith set about restoring the settlement at port louis, repairing the damage done by the "lexington" raid and renaming it 'anson's harbour'. lt lowcay succeeded smith in april 1838, followed by lt robinson in september 1839 and lt tyssen in december 1839.
vernet later attempted to return to the islands but was refused permission to return. the british crown reneged on promises and refused to recognise rights granted by captain onslow at the time of the reoccupation. eventually, after travelling to london, vernet received paltry compensation for horses shipped to port louis many years before. g.t. whittington obtained a concession of from vernet that he later exploited with the formation of the falkland islands commercial fishery and agricultural association.
immediately following their return to the falkland islands and the failure of vernet's settlement, the british maintained port louis as a military outpost. there was no attempt to colonise the islands following the intervention, instead there was a reliance upon the remaining rump of vernet's settlement. lt. smith received little support from the royal navy and the islands developed largely on his initiative but he had to rely on a group of armed gauchos to enforce authority and protect british interests. smith received advice from vernet in this regard, and in turn continued to administer vernet's property and provide him with regular accounts. his superiors later rebuked him for his ideas and actions in promoting the development of the small settlement in port louis. in frustration, smith resigned but his successors lt. lowcay and lt. tyssen did not continue with the initiatives smith had pursued and the settlement began to stagnate.
in 1836, east falkland was surveyed by admiral george grey, and further in 1837 by lowcay. admiral george grey, conducting the geographic survey in november 1836 had the following to say about their first view of east falkland:
pressure to develop the islands as a colony began to build as the result of a campaign mounted by british merchant g.t. whittington. whittington formed the falkland islands commercial fishery and agricultural association and (based on information indirectly obtained from vernet) published a pamphlet entitled "the falkland islands". later a petition signed by london merchants was presented to the british government demanding the convening of a public meeting to discuss the future development of the falkland islands. whittington petitioned the colonial secretary, lord russell, proposing that his association be allowed to colonise the islands. in may 1840, the british government made the decision to colonise the falkland islands.
unaware of the decision by the british government to colonise the islands, whittington grew impatient and decided to take action of his own initiative. obtaining two ships, he sent his brother, j. b. whittington, on a mission to land stores and settlers at port louis. on arrival he presented his claim to land that his brother had bought from vernet. lt. tyssen was taken aback by whittington's arrival, indicating that he had no authority to allow this; however, he was unable to prevent the party from landing. whittington constructed a large house for his party, and using a salting house built by vernet established a fish-salting business.
in 1833 the united kingdom asserted authority over the falkland islands and richard clement moody, a highly esteemed royal engineer, was appointed as lieutenant governor of the islands. this post was renamed governor of the falkland islands in 1843, when he also became commander-in-chief of the falkland islands. moody left england for falkland on 1 october 1841 aboard the ship "hebe" and
arrived in anson's harbour later that month. he was accompanied by twelve sappers and miners and their families; together with whittington's colonists this brought the population of anson's harbour to approximately 50. when moody arrived, the falklands was 'almost in a state of anarchy', but he used his powers 'with great wisdom and moderation' to develop the islands' infrastructure and, commanding detachment of sappers, erected government offices, a school and barracks, residences, ports, and a new road system.
in 1842, moody was instructed by lord stanley the british secretary of state for war and the colonies to report on the potential of the port william area as the site of the new capital. moody assigned the task of surveying the area to captain ross, leader of the antarctic expedition. captain ross delivered his report in 1843, concluding that port william afforded a good deep-water anchorage for naval vessels, and that the southern shores of port jackson was a suitable location for the proposed settlement. moody accepted the recommendation of ross and construction of the new settlement started in july 1843. inn july 1845, at moody's suggestion, the new capital of the islands was officially named port stanley after lord stanley. not everyone was enthused with the selection of the location of the new capital, j. b. whittington famously remarked that "of all the miserable bog holes, i believe that mr moody has selected one of the worst for the site of his town."
the structure of the colonial government was established in 1845 with the formation of the legislative council and executive council and work on the construction of government house commenced. the following year, the first officers appointed to the colonial government took their posts; by this time a number of residences, a large storage shed, carpenter's shop and blacksmith's shop had been completed and the government dockyard laid out. in 1845 moody introduced tussock grass into great britain from falkland, for which he received the gold medal of the royal agricultural society. the coat of arms of the falkland islands notably includes an image of tussock grass. moody returned to england in february 1849. moody brook is named after him.
with the establishment of the deep-water anchorage and improvements in port facilities, stanley saw a dramatic increase in the number of visiting ships in the 1840s in part due to the california gold rush. a boom in ship provisioning and ship-repair resulted, aided by the notoriously bad weather in the south atlantic and around cape horn. stanley and the falkland islands are famous as the repository of many wrecks of 19th-century ships that reached the islands only to be condemned as unseaworthy and were often employed as floating warehouses by local merchants.
at one point in the 19th century, stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. however, the ship-repair trade began to slacken off in 1876 with the establishment of the plimsoll line, which saw the elimination of the so-called coffin ships and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise have ended up in stanley for repair. with the introduction of increasingly reliable iron steamships in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the panama canal in 1914. port stanley continued to be a busy port supporting whaling and sealing activities in the early part of the 20th century, british warships (and garrisons) in the first and second world war and the fishing and cruise ship industries in the latter half of the century.
government house opened as the offices of the lieutenant governor in 1847. government house continued to develop with various additions, formally becoming the governor's residence in 1859 when governor moore took residence. government house remains the residence of the governor.
many of the colonists begin to move from ansons' harbour to port stanley. as the new town expanded, the population grew rapidly, reaching 200 by 1849. the population was further expanded by the arrival of 30 married chelsea pensioners and their families. the chelsea pensioners were to form the permanent garrison and police force, taking over from the royal sappers and miners regiment who had garrisoned the early colony.
the exchange building opened in 1854; part of the building was later used as a church. 1854 also saw the establishment of marmont row, including the eagle inn, now known as the upland goose hotel. in 1887, jubilee villas were built to celebrate the golden jubilee of queen victoria. jubilee villas are a row of brick built houses that follow a traditional british pattern; positioned on ross road near the waterfront, they became an iconic image during the falklands war.
peat is common on the islands and has traditionally been exploited as a fuel. uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to peat slips in 1878 and 1886. the 1878 peat slip resulted in the destruction of several houses, whilst the 1886 peat slip resulted in the deaths of two women and the destruction of the exchange building.
christ church cathedral was consecrated in 1892 and completed in 1903. it received its famous whalebone arch, constructed from the jaws of two blue whales, in 1933 to commemorate the centenary of continuous british administration. also consecrated in 1892 was the tabernacle united free church, constructed from an imported timber kit.
a few years after the british had established themselves in the islands, a number of new british settlements were started. initially many of these settlements were established in order to exploit the feral cattle on the islands. following the introduction of the cheviot breed of sheep to the islands in 1852, sheep farming became the dominant form of agriculture on the islands.
salvador settlement was one of the earliest, being started in the 1830s, by a gibraltarian immigrant (hence its other name of "gibraltar settlement"), and it is still run by his descendants, the pitalugas.
vernet furnished samuel fisher lafone, a british merchant operating from montevideo, with details of the falkland islands including a map. sensing that the exploitation of feral cattle on the islands would be a lucrative venture, in 1846 he negotiated a contract with the british government that gave him exclusive rights to this resource. until 1846 moody had allotted feral cattle to new settlers and the new agreement not only prevented this but made stanley dependent upon lafone for supplies of beef.
cattle were concentrated in the southern part of east falkland, an area that became known as lafonia. lafone was an absentee landlord and never actually set foot on the islands. his activities were not monitored by the british and rather than introducing more british settlers as he promised, he brought large numbers of spanish and indian gauchos to hunt cattle. in 1846, they established hope place on the south shores of brenton loch and in 1849 a sod wall (the boca wall) was built across the isthmus at darwin to control the movement of cattle.
lafone continued to develop his business interests and in 1849 looked to establish a joint stock company with his london creditors. the company was launched as "the royal falkland land, cattle, seal and fishery company" in 1850 but soon thereafter was incorporated under royal charter as the falkland islands company limited. lafone became a director and his brother-in-law j.p. dale the company's first manager in the islands. by 1852, the feral cattle had been hunted virtually to extinction by gauchos and the company switched to sheep farming with the introduction of the cheviot breed of sheep. hope place proved to be an unsuitable location and the operation moved to darwin. in 1860, the lafone beef contract was terminated but the falkland islands company was given a grant to lafonia. ownership of the remaining cattle outside of lafonia reverted to the crown and hunting cattle without permission was banned.
in the second half of the 19th century, darwin, goose green, fox bay and port howard were established. port howard was founded by james lovegrove waldron, and his brother in 1866; the waldron brothers later left for patagonia, but left the farm under local management.
darwin was initially the haunt of "gauchos" and cattle farmers, but sheep farming came to dominate the area, and scottish shepherds were brought in. a few years later, the first large tallow works in the islands (though not the first) was set up by the fic in 1874. it handled 15,891 sheep in 1880.
from the 1880s, until 1972, darwin and fox bay had their own separate medical officers. nowadays, most medical care is based in stanley.
the falkland islands were used as a base for whaling ships hunting the southern right whale and sperm whale from the 1770s until british authority was established over the islands and surrounding seas. whaling was briefly revived with the establishment of a whaling station on new island from 1909 to 1917 until whaling operations moved to south georgia.
fur seals had long been exploited for their pelts but numbers entered a drastic decline in the early 19th century. as a result, seal hunting died off, although continuing at a low level. in order to conserve stocks, a ban on the hunting of fur seals during summers months was enacted in 1881, but it was not until 1921 that hunting was banned entirely.
elephant seals were exploited for oil but like the fur seals their numbers declined drastically in the mid-1850s. sealers instead turned their attention to the south american sea lion resulting in a dramatic decline in their numbers that made sealing uneconomic. attempts to revive the trade, including a sealing station at port albermarle, were unsuccessful.
even penguins were exploited for oil. rockhopper and gentoo penguins were rendered down in trypots from 1860 until the 1880s.
although the first telephone lines were installed by the falkland islands company in the 1880s, the falkland islands government was slow to embrace telephony. it was not until 1897 that a telephone line was installed between cape pembroke lighthouse and the police station. the islands isolation was broken in 1911 when guglielmo marconi installed a wireless telegraphy station that enabled telegrams to be sent to mainland uruguay.
a line was laid between darwin and stanley, with the ship "consort" landing poles on the coast. construction commenced in 1906 and was finished in 1907 (a length of nearly ). the line was initially only for business but the public could make calls occasionally. lines continued to be laid to most of the major settlements in the islands, with the falkland islands police responsible for their maintenance till 1927. communications among the settlements relied on the telephone network until radio telephones were introduced in the 1950s, although the telephone network continued until 1982. telecommunications improved dramatically after the falklands war, when an earth station was installed to allow direct dialling for the first time. in 1997, an internet service was launched and by 2002 nearly 90% of falkland homes had internet access.
a canning factory was opened in 1911 at goose green and was initially extremely successful. it absorbed a large proportion of surplus sheep but during the postwar slump it suffered a serious loss and closed in 1921.
despite this setback, a mere year later, the settlement grew after it became the base for the falkland islands company's sheep farm in lafonia in 1922, with improved sheep handling and wool shed being built. in 1927, the settlement's huge sheep shearing shed was built, which is claimed to be the world's largest, with a capacity of five thousand sheep. in 1979, 100,598 sheep were shorn at goose green
the mid-20th century saw a number of abortive attempts to diversify the islands' economy away from large scale sheep ranching.
in the period just after the second world war, port albemarle, in the south west of west falkland, was enlarged during the post-wwii period by the colonial development company and included its own power station, jetty, nissen huts etc.; this was an attempt to revive the old sealing industry which had flourished during the 19th century. however, the project proved to be unviable, not least because seal numbers had declined massively.
similarly, ajax bay on falkland sound, was developed by the colonial development corporation in the 1950s, which was also responsible for developing port albemarle. it was mainly a refrigeration plant, and was supposed to freeze falkland mutton, but this was found to be economically unviable, despite the huge expense incurred. many of the pre-fabricated houses here were moved to stanley. the site later became a british field hospital during the landings of operation sutton.
the seas around the falkland islands were not well policed prior to the falklands war, and many foreign boats fished off the islands, despite protests that potential revenue was being lost. fishing licences were only later to be introduced.
in 1956, j.l. waldron ltd built a school at port howard, possibly inspired by the "gift" of the fic at darwin, a few years earlier.
up until the 1970s, goose green was the site of a boarding school, run by the state. "camp" children boarded here, and there were 40 spaces. the boarding school was later transferred to stanley, although the recent emphasis has been on locally based education. the school itself became an argentine hq, and was burnt down. a new (day) school has been built for local children.
port stanley became an important coaling station for the royal navy. this led to ships based there being involved in major naval engagements in both the first and second world wars.
the strategic significance of the falkland islands was confirmed by the second major naval engagement of the first world war. admiral graf maximilian von spee's german east asia squadron called at the islands on its trip from the pacific ocean back to germany, intending to destroy the royal navy radio relay station and coaling depot there. unknown to spee, a british squadron, including two battlecruisers considerably more powerful than his forces, had been sent to hunt down his squadron and happened to be in the harbour coaling. in the one-sided battle which followed, most of spee's squadron was sunk. canopus hill, south of stanley, is named after hms "canopus", which had fired the first shot in the battle.
the falkland islands defence force was called out to man gun positions and signalling posts around stanley as soon as word was received of britain's declaration of war on 3 september 1939. mounted patrols were carried out in the camp, and coast-watching stations were created around the islands to guard against the approach of enemy ships and the landing of enemy forces. the falkland islanders experienced much the same kind of war-time privations and restrictions as the british population, including black-outs, travel restrictions, and rationing.
in december, 1939, in the immediate aftermath of the battle of the river plate, county class heavy cruiser hms "cumberland", which had been self-refitting in the falkland islands at the time of the battle, steamed to join "ajax" and "achilles" at the mouth of the river plate, trapping the graf spee. convinced by british propaganda and false intelligence that a major naval task force awaited his ship and short of ammunition, captain langsdorf of the "graf spee" chose instead to scuttle the ship rather than face the royal navy.
operation tabarin, an expedition to the antarctic, was mounted from the islands during the war. the purpose of the expedition was to assert britain's claims on the continent, as well as gather scientific data. operation tabarin was later replaced by the falkland islands dependencies survey, which was later renamed the british antarctic survey.
in 1942, in response to the japanese entry into the war, additional forces were sent to the islands to strengthen their defence against invasion. the largest component of these additional forces was a battalion of the west yorkshire regiment. in 1944, as a result of the reduced threat of invasion from japan, the west yorks were replaced by a smaller contingent of the royal scots.
over the whole war more than 150 falkland islanders out of a population of only 2,300 volunteered for the british armed forces - 6.5% of the entire population - 24 of whom did not return. in july 1944, all volunteers were given the right to be identified by a "falkland islands" shoulder-flash. in addition to these contributions to the british war-effort, the falkland islands also donated five supermarine spitfires to the british royal air force.
with the exception of an attempt by president juan peron to buy the falkland islands in 1953 which was rejected as inconceivable by the british government, the immediate post-war period was fairly uneventful. however, a series of incidents in the 1960s marked the intensification of argentine sovereignty claims.
the first of these took place in 1964, when a light plane piloted by miguel fitzgerald touched down on the racecourse at stanley. leaping from the aircraft, he handed a letter claiming sovereignty to a bemused islander before flying off again. the stunt was timed to coincide with argentine diplomatic efforts at the un decolonisation committee.
a more serious incident took place on 28 september 1966 when eighteen young peronists staged a symbolic invasion of the islands by hijacking an aerolineas argentina airliner and landing it in stanley; the group called this action operation condor. there, they raised seven argentine flags and took four islanders hostage. the planning had been done during a trip to the islands that one of the leaders, cristina verrier, had made as a tourist. before leaving, twenty plotters had been "locked up" for three days at a training camp on a "spiritual retreat." at one point, two of them left the group.
the airliner left at 12:30 p.m. from buenos aires, bound for río gallegos with 48 passengers on board, including argentine rear admiral jose maria guzmán, who was on his way to tierra del fuego, an argentine territory of which he was governor. two armed men, dardo cabo, 25, and alejandro giovenco, entered the flight deck and ordered commander ernesto fernandez garcia to change course toward the falklands. two of the men approached guzmán in the cabin and told him of the hijacking, and one of his aides-de-camp attempted to get his pistol, but he was struck down.
the airplane landed at 8:42 a.m. in port stanley, behind the house occupied by governor sir cosmo dugal patrick thomas haskard, who was away from the island. the pilot attempted to land at the racecourse but the plane hit telegraph poles, and the undercarriage sank into the mud. islanders, assuming that the plane was in trouble, rushed to assist but found themselves taken hostage by the hijackers (included in the group of four was a young police sergeant, terry peck, who became a local hero in the falklands war). the argentines exited the airplane by rope and formed themselves in front of the craft in the form of a fan: they hoisted seven argentine flags. they then sang the argentine national anthem, attempting at first to turn authority over the island to guzmán, who refused the offer.
les gleadell, acting governor of the falkland islands, ordered that the dc-4 be surrounded. he received three of the invaders, who announced that they had as much right as anyone to be there and in reply were firmly told that they should disarm and give up. the result of this meeting was an agreement that seven men, including peck and captain ian martin, commanding a four-man royal marines detachment, should be exchanged for the hostages aboard the aircraft. the 26 passengers were then allowed to disembark and sent to lodge with local families, as the island had no hotel. on being taken past the governor's residence, guzmán laughingly commented: ""mi casa"" ("my house").
after a bitterly cold night in the aircraft, which contained only brandy, wine, orange juice and a few biscuits, the kidnappers surrendered. they were kept locked up in an annex to st mary's church for a week until they were put aboard an argentine ship, the "bahia buen suceso," which had lingered outside the harbor awaiting conclusion of the affair. the men were tried in argentina on crimes that included illegal deprivation of freedom, possession of weapons of war, illegal association, piracy, and robbery in the open. the leaders were sentenced to three years in prison and the others to nine months.
on october of the same year a group of argentine naval special forces conducted covert landings from the submarine ara "santiago del estero". the 12-man team, which landed some from stanley, was led by juan jose lombardo who later, as chief of naval operations, planned the 1982 invasion of the falkland islands.
in november 1968, miguel fitzgerald was hired by the argentine press to attempt a reprise of his 1964 landing. accompanied by one of the 1966 hijackers, he flew to stanley but on arrival found he could not land at the racecourse due to obstacles placed following the hijacking. the plane was forced to crash land on eliza cove road, but the two occupants were unharmed. the stunt was intended to coincide with the visit of lord chalfont to the islands.
the latter incident proved counter-productive to the argentine sovereignty push, as lord chalfont had been talking to a public meeting at the time of the plane's arrival. the islanders made it plain to lord chalfont that they rejected a memorandum of agreement negotiated between britain and argentina that august which stated that britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. this spurred the formation of the falkland islands committee by london barrister bill hunter-christie and others. the emergency committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining foreign office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. in december 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the british government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.
partly as the result of diplomatic pressure, economic and political links with argentina increased in the 1960s and 1970s. these became severed after the end of the falklands war, but before the war they were not entirely negative, and some islanders sent their children to boarding schools in argentina.
realising that any talks on the sovereignty issue would be derailed if it did not meet with the islanders' wishes, the british and argentine governments enacted a series of measures designed to encourage dependence on argentina. in 1971, following secret talks between the two governments (and without consulting the islanders), the communications agreement was signed. the thrust of the agreement was the establishment of direct air and sea links between the islands and argentina, together with agreements on postal and telephony services. following the agreement the subsidised shipping link with montevideo ended, a passenger and cargo ship service to the mainland (that would ameliorate any dependence on argentina) was promised by the british but never provided.
"líneas aéreas del estado" (lade), the airline operated by the argentine air force ("fuerza aérea argentina" or faa), began an air link to the islands. initially this service operated amphibious aircraft between comodoro rivadavia and stanley using grumman hu-16 albatross aircraft. the inauguration of the service was commemorated by a series of stamps issued by both the argentine and falkland island postal services. in 1972, a temporary airstrip was constructed by argentina near stanley. britain constructed a small permanent airstrip in 1976 suitable only for short haul flights.
as part of the agreement, islanders had to travel via argentina and were forced to carry argentine identity cards issued in buenos aires. the "tarjeta provisoria" or "white card" as they were known were hated by the islanders, who felt they were a "de facto" argentine passport, since only islanders were required to use them and not other temporary residents of the islands. tensions were raised further with the agreement that male falkland islanders would not have to undertake conscription into the argentine army, since this carried the implication that falkland islanders were argentine citizens.
lade set up an office in stanley and mail was routed through argentina. medical treatments unavailable in the islands were provided in argentina and scholarships were made available for study in buenos aires, córdoba and other argentine cities. spanish language teachers were provided by argentina. foreign office officials in stanley were instructed to do everything possible to foster good relations between the islands and argentina.
the islands became more dependent upon argentina, when the british and argentine governments agreed that the islands would be supplied with petrol, diesel and oil by ypf, the argentine national oil and gas company.
despite these tensions relationships between the islanders and the argentines operating the new services in the islands were cordial. although there was apprehension, politics were generally avoided and on a one-to-one basis there was never any real hostility.
on the international level, relations began to sour in 1975 when argentine delegates at the london meeting of the international parliamentary union condemned britain's "act of international piracy" in establishing a colony in the falkland islands. diplomatic relations between britain and argentina were broken but resumed in 1976.
in october 1975, the british government tasked lord shackleton (son of the antarctic explorer sir ernest shackleton) with an economic survey of the falkland islands. the argentine government reacted furiously and refused permission for lord shackleton to travel via argentina. later the ship transporting shackleton to the islands, the rrs "shackleton", was fired upon by the argentine destroyer ara "almirante storni".
in 1976, after a military "junta" took control of the country, argentina covertly established a military base on southern thule. it was discovered by the british antarctic survey ship rrs "bransfield" in 1977. the british protested but restricted their response to a diplomatic protest. backing up the diplomatic efforts, the british prime minister jim callaghan sent a naval task force consisting of surface ships and a nuclear submarine. nevertheless, argentine aircraft and warships harassed ships fishing in falkland waters.
lord shackleton's report was delivered in 1977 and documented the economic stagnation in the islands. it nevertheless concluded that the islands made a net contribution to the british economy and had economic potential for development. recommendations included oil exploration, exploitation of the fisheries, extension of the stanley runway, the creation of a development agency, the expansion of the road network, expansion of the facilities at stanley harbour and the breakdown of absentee landlord owned farms into family units. the report was largely ignored at the time, as it was felt that acting upon it would sour relations with argentina. a reprise of the report by lord shackleton in 1982 following the falklands war became the blueprint for subsequent economic development of the islands.
argentina invaded the islands on 2 april 1982, using special forces, which landed at mullet creek and advanced on government house in stanley, with a secondary force coming in from yorke bay. they encountered little opposition, there being only a small force of fifty-seven british marines and eleven sailors, in addition to the falkland islands defence force (who were later sent to fox bay). there was only one argentine fatality. the event garnered international attention at a level which the islands had never experienced before, and made them a household name in the uk.
for a brief period, the falkland islands found themselves under argentine control. this included spanish-language signage, and attempts to make the islanders drive on the right (although few roads in the falklands at the time actually had two lanes). in many parts of the camp, such as goose green and pebble island, the islanders found themselves under house arrest.
the british responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and, after fierce fighting, forced the argentine garrison to surrender on 14 june 1982. the war proved to be an anomaly in a number of different respects, not least that it proved that small arms still had a role to play. it also had major consequences for the "junta", which was toppled soon afterwards.
margaret thatcher's general political legacy remains controversial and divisive within the uk and within the context of the falklands her government's withdrawal of hms "endurance" is a stated contributing factor to the causes of the conflict because it gave the wrong signals about the uk attitude towards maintaining its possession. however, within the falklands, she is considered a heroine because of the determination of her response to the argentine invasion. the islands celebrate "margaret thatcher day" on every 10 january, and named a street "thatcher drive" after her, in stanley.
following the war, britain focused on improving its facilities on the islands. it increased its military presence significantly, building a large base at raf mount pleasant and its port at mare harbour. it also invested heavily in improving facilities in stanley and transportation and infrastructure around the islands, tarmacking the stanley - mount pleasant road and many roads within stanley. the population has risen due to the growth of stanley, but has declined in "camp" (the countryside).
since november 2008, a regular ferry service has linked east and west, carrying cars, passengers and cargo serviced by mv "concordia bay", a 42.45 m twin-screw shallow draft (2.59 m) landing craft.
a major change to the way the falkland islands are governed was introduced by the 1985 constitution. under the 1985 constitution the falkland islands government (fig) became a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, with the governor as head of government and representative of the queen. members of the fig are democratically elected; the governor is purely a figurehead with no executive powers. effectively under this constitution, the falkland islands are self-governing with the exception of foreign policy, although the fig represents itself at the united nations special committee on decolonisation as the british government no longer attends.
links with argentina became severed during the post-war period, with laws being introduced to forbid argentine citizens from buying land. an alternative trading partner was found in chile, and over the years, the islands found themselves with closer links to that country, with flights being introduced to punta arenas, in the far south of patagonian chile, near tierra del fuego. in recent years, argentines have been allowed to visit the islands again, often to visit the military cemeteries where their friends and loved ones are buried.
mines continue to be a persistent problem, and though some areas have been cleared, massive minefields are still to be found on both the main islands and elsewhere, particularly in the areas immediately around stanley. because peat moves over time, the mines themselves have shifted location.
as well as the military build-up, the uk also passed the british nationality (falkland islands) act 1983 which granted full british citizenship to the islanders. high-profile british dignitaries also visited to show british commitment to the islands, including margaret thatcher, the prince of wales and princess alexandra. in 1985, the falkland islands dependency was split into the falkland islands proper and a new separate territory of south georgia and the south sandwich islands.
relations between the uk and argentina remained hostile following 1982, and diplomatic relations were restored in 1989. although the united nations general assembly passed a resolution calling for the uk and argentina to return to negotiations over the islands' future, the uk ruled out any further talks over the islands' sovereignty. the uk also maintained an arms embargo against argentina that was initiated during the 1982 war, which forced argentine armed forces, a traditional uk buyer, switch to other markets.
relations between the uk and argentina improved further in the 1990s. in 1998, carlos menem, the president of argentina visited london, where he reaffirmed his country's claims to the islands, although he stated that argentina would use only peaceful means for their recovery. in 2001, tony blair, prime minister of the united kingdom visited argentina where he stated that he hoped the uk and argentina could resolve their differences that led to the 1982 war. however, no talks on sovereignty took place during the visit. his reception in argentina was more welcoming than that of the princess of wales (diana spencer) in 1995, who was heckled by the mother of an argentine soldier killed in the war.
after the war ended, the british still faced the problem of potential argentine aggression in the future, so an aircraft carrier had to remain on station to guard the islands with its squadron of sea harriers until the local airfield was prepared for jet aircraft. was the first to take guard duty, whilst went north to change a gearbox that had broken while departing the mainland uk, the argentines claimed the aircraft carrier was hit on 30 may, and needed repairs. "invincible" then returned to relieve "hermes" which urgently needed to return to the uk to have its boilers cleaned. "invincible" returned until the ship was relieved by , which was quickly rushed south and commissioned during the journey. once the port stanley runway was available for jets, "illustrious" was relieved by several raf f-4 phantoms.
the islands lacked barracks for a permanent garrison, so the ministry of defence chartered two former car ferries as barracks ships: from the union company of new zealand and from sealink in britain. "rangatira" arrived in port stanley on 11 july 1982 and stayed until 26 september 1983.
the british government later decided to construct a new raf base as the centrepiece of plans to considerably strengthen the island's defences. this was intended to deter any future argentine attempts to take the islands by force again. it was a massive undertaking, requiring the construction of the world's longest corridor, a half-mile long, linking barracks, messes and recreational and the welfare areas of the base. the base is occasionally referred to by its residents as the death star because of its vast size, and sometimes confusing layout.
mount pleasant, to the west of stanley, was chosen as the site for the new base. the airfield was opened by the duke of york in 1985, and became fully operational in 1986.
using the iata airport code mpn, raf mount pleasant also acts as the falkland islands' only international airport, in addition to its military role. flights open to civilian passengers are operated twice-weekly.
these flights are currently operated by a civilian airline on behalf of the royal air force, and fly to and from raf brize norton in oxfordshire, uk with a refuelling stop at raf ascension island in the south-central atlantic ocean. chilean airline lan airlines also operate weekly flights from santiago.
in may 2005, some english tabloid newspapers reported that argentina might be considering another invasion of the islands. the "sunday express" carried the frontpage headline, "falklands invasion alert" on its 22 may edition, citing an increase in argentine military activity near the islands, as well as a reported increase in the british garrison, including a royal navy ship allegedly carrying tactical nuclear weapons (the last royal navy tactical nuclear weapons were withdrawn in the late 1990s). the only nuclear armed rn vessels in service at the time were the four vanguard class submarines, which were armed with trident missiles. two days later, "india daily" published speculation that the islands could be a nuclear flashpoint in the future if argentina were to gain a nuclear arsenal, citing the findings of an unnamed international thinktank. there was no official comment on the stories by the british or argentine governments, and other writers have denounced the stories as "nonsense" - any such invasion would meet with a considerably larger falklands based british force than in 1982.
before the falklands war, sheep-farming was the falkland islands' only industry. fishing has become the largest part of the economy since two species of squid popular with consumers were discovered in substantial numbers near the falklands in the late 1980s. on 14 september 2011 rockhopper exploration announced plans are under way for oil production to commence in 2016, through the use of floating production storage and offloading (fpso) technology, replicating the methodology used on the foinaven field off the shetland islands. the production site will require approximately 110 people working offshore and another 40 working onshore. the oil is expected to trade at of the brent crude price.
some of the small businesses attempted at fox bay have included a market garden, a salmon farm and a knitting mill with "warrah knitwear".
tourism is the second-largest part of the economy. the war brought the islands newfound fame, and tourists came both to see the islands' wildlife and go on war tours. cruise ships often visit, frequently as a tie-in to antarctica. nonetheless, the remoteness of the archipelago, and the lack of direct flights to major cities, have made the islands an expensive holiday destination, and as a result mass tourism has not really begun.
in line with the increasing global interest in environmental issues, some nature reserves have been set up around the islands, although there are no national parks. in the 1990s, two of the jason islands, steeple jason island and grand jason island, were bought by new york philanthropist michael steinhardt, who later donated them to the bronx zoo-based wildlife conservation society. he also gave them us$425,000 to build a conservation station named after himself and his wife judy.
likewise in sea lion island, in 1990, the clifton family who had owned the island sold it to the falkland island development company. they had planted 60,000 stands of tussac grass, which was considered important as much of the tussac grass on the two main islands had been depredated by grazing. a similar trend may be seen on bleaker island, where the farm "went organic" in 1999.

the falkland islands are located in the south atlantic ocean between 51°s and 53°s on a projection of the patagonian shelf, part of the south american continental shelf. in ancient geological time this shelf was part of gondwana, and around 400 million years ago split from what is now africa and drifted westwards from it. today the islands are subjected to the roaring forties, winds that shape both their geography and climate.
the falklands comprise two main islands, west falkland and east falkland, and about 776 small islands.
the geological history of the falkland islands began during the precambrian era more than 1000 million years ago, when proterozoic granites and gneisses were laid down in gondwana. these rocks became part of the cape meredith/ formation and outcrop at the cape. during the siluro-devonian era, these rocks were overlain with quartzose and subarkosic sandstones with some siltstone and mudstone, rocks that are particularly erosion- and weather-resistant, giving these parts of the islands a rugged landscape and coastline.
tectonic forces continued to form the region: a mountain chain formed, part of which now creates wickham heights on east falkland island and extends westwards through west falkland into the jason islands. a basin developed and was filled with land-based, or terrigenous, sediments. these layers of sand and mud filled the basin as it sank and as they hardened they produced the rocks of the sedimentary lafonia group of the falklands. these rocks are similar to those in southern africa's karoo basin.
about 290 million years ago, in the carboniferous period, an ice age engulfed the area as glaciers advanced from the polar region eroding and transporting rocks. these rocks were deposited as extensive moraines and glacial till, or they sank in the sea while the glacier floated in a layer of ice. when the glacial sediments were turned into stone they formed the rocks that now make up the fitzroy tillite formation in the falklands. identical rocks are found in southern africa.
during the break-up of gondwana and the formation of the atlantic ocean some 200 million years ago, minor crustal fragments that were to become the falkland islands detached themselves from the nascent african continent and drifted westwards, dividing and rotating as they did so before settling on the patagonian shelf. most of the layers of west falkland and its surrounding islands are slightly inclined from the horizontal. this inclination shows different types of rocks in different places. the quartzites of port stephens and stanley are more resistant than the arenaceous sediments of the formation at fox bay. the hornby mountains, near falkland sound have experienced tectonic forces of uplift and folding which has inclined the quartzite beds of stanley to the vertical.
rocks from more recent geological periods such as the jurassic, cretaceous, and tertiary periods usually contain lime-rich rocks. the absence of such rocks has led to an acidic substrate which manifests itself in the nature of the soil.
the falkland islands are an archipelago of 778 islands with an area of located in the south atlantic ocean on a projection of the patagonian shelf. the two principal islands, east falkland and west falkland, account for 91% of the land area. these two islands, which have a combined distance of from east to west and from north to south, are separated by the falkland sound, a channel that averages in width and has a typical depth of . cape meredith on west falkland is about north-west of the tip of tierra del fuego and westpoint, also on west falkland and adjacent to west point island, is about from the patagonian coast. it is believed that at times during the pleistocene epoch, relative sea level was some lower than the present time–sufficient for the sound to be bridged.
east falkland, which has an area of , a little over half the total area of the islands consists of two land masses of approximately equal size – the southerly part known as lafonia, but the northerly part has no specific name. these land masses are joined by an isthmus of width that separates two deep fjords, choiseul sound and brenton loch-grantham sound from each other. the island's coastline has many smaller bays, inlets and headlands. over 70% of the population of the falkland islands live in the capital, stanley, which is located in east falkland.
the northern part of the island, apart from the coastal strip bordering the choiseul sound, is largely underlain by palaeozoic rocks in the form of quartzite and slate, which tend to form rugged landscapes and coastlines and to cause the soil to be poor and acidic. the principal range of hills, the wickham heights runs from north-east to south-west. the highest point of the range (also the highest point in the falklands), is mount usborne which has a height of . the area away from the mountain range consists chiefly of low undulating ground, a mixture of pasture and morass, with many shallow freshwater tarns, and small streams running in the valleys. two inlets, berkeley sound and port william, run far into the land at the north-eastern extremity of the island and provide anchorage for shipping.
in contrast, lafonia is underlain by mesozoic age sandstone, a younger rock than the palaeozoic rock to the north, giving a flatter landscape than is seen elsewhere on the island. sheets of liquid basalt intruded into the cracks that formed between the sedimentary layers. the resulting solidified sheets can now be seen in the form of dikes that cut the oldest sedimentary layers, those that lie principally in the southern part of east falkland and in south africa.
west falkland has an area of , making it smaller than east falkland. mount adam, the highest point in the island and part of the hornby hills, is above sea level. the hornby hills which are the principal range on the island run approximately north-south parallel with falkland sound.
in west falkland there are several dykes that cut the rocks of the western islands, but these dykes, unlike the previous ones, are chemically more unstable and have been eroded. the only indications of their existence are the aligned linear depressions. in the margins of these depressions there is evidence of contact baking or hornfels formation adjacent to the once molten basalt dyke.
west falkland is more hilly on the side closest to east falkland.
the southernmost point of west falkland is cape meredith, and the most south-westerly point is calm head. on the southerly side lie high cliffs with an abundance of seabirds.
in addition to the two main islands, the falkland islands have over 700 further islands, many no more than a few hectares in area. the islands to the north west of west falkland include pebble island (103 km), keppel island (36 km), saunders island (131 km), carcass island, west point island and the jason group of islands (33 km) that lie some from west falkland.
the principal islands to the south west of west falkland include new island (22 km), weddell island (265 km), beaver island (48 km) and staats island. the group of islands that are separated from lafonia by the eagle passage include speedwell island (51 km), and george island (24 km). other islands off the lafonia coast include bleaker island (21 km), sealion island, lively island (56 km), barren island. in addition, beauchene island, a rocky outcrop lies some from the lafonia coast.
many of the islands are nature reserves, either in whole or in part.
the patagonian shelf, which in ancient geological time was part of gondwana and which broke from what is now africa, drifted westwards relative to africa. it is now the widest continental shelf in the world covering .
it protrudes some into the south atlantic ocean from the patagonian coastline and slopes gently to before falling away; the falkland islands being located two thirds of the way along this protrusion. the base of the plateau is about below sea level to the west of the islands (400 km from the patagonian coast), sloping to to the east of the islands where it falls away into the south atlantic ocean. the falklands plateau, a slightly shallower stretch of water lies to the immediate east of the falkland islands.
to the immediate south of the islands, the falklands plateau is split into two by the falklands trough, a submarine valley that separates the plateau proper from the scotia arc – an underwater ridge that links tierra del fuego with the burdwood bank (where the water is only deep) and, further into the atlantic ocean/great southern ocean, with a number of islands including south orkneys, south sandwich islands and south georgia.
licences to harvest the large variety of fish that live on the shelf provides a major source of income for the islands as does the licensing of oil exploration.
the falkland islands have a maritime climate in the transition region between the tundra and subarctic zones (köppen classifications "et" and "cfc" respectively) which is characterised by both low seasonal and diurnal temperature ranges and no marked wet and dry season while in the sub-arctic zone the average monthly maximum temperature exceeds for no more than four months of the year and the average monthly minimum does not drop below . the falkland islands climate is very much influenced by both the cool ocean currents and the shielding effect of the andes.
the cold antarctic coastal current flows in an easterly direction around cape horn where part of it is diverted northwards as the falklands current. subsurface temperatures in the vicinity of the falklands are of the order of 6 °c. the falklands current meets the warm south brazilian current at about 40°s (see brazil–falkland confluence), some north of the islands. the prevailing winds at the falklands' latitude are the westerlies that gather moisture across the pacific ocean, but the andes form a barrier causing a rain shadow across the patagonia and to a lesser extent, the falkland islands.
the january average maximum temperature is about 13 °c (55 °f), and the july maximum average temperature is about 4 °c (39 °f). the rainfall varies between 300 mm in parts of lafonia to 1400 mm in the mountain ranges with an average annual rainfall of 573 mm. humidity and winds, however, are constantly high. snow is rare but can occur at almost any time of year. gales are very frequent, particularly in winter.
in addition to parts of the falklands, a maritime subarctic climatic zone is found in parts of coastal iceland, faroe islands, north western coastal norway, southern islands of alaska and parts of the alaskan panhandle, the southern tip of south america and mountainous areas of europe including the scottish highlands and south-western norway.
biogeographically, the falkland islands are classified as part of the antarctic ecozone and antarctic floristic kingdom. strong connections exist with the flora and fauna of patagonia in south america. the only terrestrial mammal upon the arrival of europeans was the warrah, the "loup-renard" of louis antoine de bougainville, a kind of fox found on both major islands that became extinct in the mid-19th century. slater suggests that the warrah was introduced into the falkland islands either by rafting or by dispersal of glacial ice during one of the glaciations of the late pleistocene epoch (2.5 million and 15,000 years ago).
a total of 14 species of marine mammals have been identified in the surrounding waters: elephant seal, fur seal and sea lions all breed on the islands with the largest elephant seal breeding site has over 500 animals. a total of 227 bird species have been seen on the islands, over 60 of which are known to breed on the islands. there are two endemic species and 14 endemic subspecies of bird. five penguin species including the magellanic penguin breed on the islands as do over 60% of the global black-browed albatross population.
there are no native reptiles or amphibians on the islands. over 200 species of insects have been recorded, along with 43 spider species and 12 worm species. only 13 terrestrial invertebrates are recognised as endemic, although information on many species is lacking and it is suspected up to two thirds of species found are actually endemic. due to the island environment, many insect species have developed reduced or absent wings. there are around 129 freshwater invertebrates, the majority being rotifer; however, the identification of some species remains in dispute. six species of fish are found in freshwater areas, including zebra trout and falklands minnows.
the islands claim a territorial sea of and an exclusive fishing zone of , which has been a source of disagreement with argentina. different species of krill are found in falkland waters, with lobster krill inhabiting the warmer waters in the north. the waters around the falkland islands are part of the patagonian shelf large marine environment. fin fish that are harvested in the falkland waters include southern blue whiting ("micromesistius australis"), rock cod ("patagonotothen"), blue grenadier or hoki ("macruronus magellanicus") and the principal species of squid that are harvested are the illex squid ("illex argentinus") and the patagonian squid ("loligo gahi"). the squid spawn in the mouth of the río de la plata close to the confluence of the cold falklands current and the warm brazilian current, migrate southwards along the patagonian shelf into the falklands waters and then return to their spawning grounds along that lies off the continental shelf.
there are no native tree species on the archipelago, although two species of bushes, fachine and native box are found. other vegetation consists of grasses and ferns. around 363 species of vascular plants, 21 species of ferns and clubmosses and 278 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the islands. of the vascular plants, 171 are believed to be native and 13 to be endemic. some bogs and fens exist and support some freshwater plant species, but these are not common on the islands. tussac grass, which averages in height but can reach up to , is found within 300 m (1,000 ft) of the coast where it forms bands around larger islands. the dense canopies formed create an insulated micro-climate suitable for many birds and invertebrates. the pale maiden ("olsynium filifolium") is the islands' proposed national flower.
prior to 1812, various colonial powers had small settlements on the falkland islands. in that year the islands were abandoned but within twenty years the british had re-established a settlement. in the 1851 census, the settlement's population was recorded as 287, increasing to 2,043 in 1901 and 2,563 in 2012.
the main settlements in the islands are at stanley which as of 2012 had a population of 2,121, and raf mount pleasant, which in 2006 had a population of about 1,700. a further 351 people lived in ""camp" (outside stanley) − just over half in east falkland, a third in west falkland and the remainder on outlying islands. the principal settlements on east falkland (excluding stanley and mount pleasant) are at darwin and goose green, on west falkland at port howard and fox bay and on the islands, the pebble island settlement. at the time of the falklands war, the settlements in "camp" were connected by tracks that were often impassable in wet weather, but by 2007 the falkland islands had a road network of , with further roads planned for construction to link all occupied mainland settlements by 2013.
in the early nineteenth century, the main economic activity on the islands was seal hunting. later the islands became a re-provisioning depot for clippers sailing from australia to the united kingdom via cape horn.
over 80% of the islands' land is given over to sheep farming, with half a million animals being supported on 11,239 km of farmland, of which 40 km was perennial pasture. roughly 40% of the national flock are on west falkland and 60% on east falkland. in addition to dairy and pig farming, a small amount of reindeer farming is carried out, for example on the beaver group of islands. this herd was the only herd in the world that was unaffected by the chernobyl disaster.
in the last decade of the twentieth century and the early twenty-first century tourism and fishing have made a major economic impact on the islands and as of 2012 an oil exploration industry was developing.
there is little long-term data on habitat changes, so the extent of human impact is unclear. vegetation such as tussac grass, fachine, and native box (hebe elliptica) have been heavily affected by introduced grazing animals. many breeding birds similarly only live on offshore islands, where introduced animals such as cats and rats are not found. virtually the entire area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep. there is also an introduced reindeer population, which was brought to the islands in 2001 for commercial purposes. rats and grey foxes have been introduced and are having a detrimental impact on birds that nest on the shores, as are feral cats. twenty-two introduced plant species are thought to provide a significant threat to local flora.

the politics of the falkland islands takes place in a framework of a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary representative democratic dependency as set out by the constitution, whereby the governor exercises the duties of head of state in the absence of the monarch and the chief executive acts as the head of government, with an elected legislative assembly to propose new laws and hold the executive to account.
the islands, an archipelago in the southern atlantic ocean, are a self-governing british overseas territory. executive power is exercised on behalf of the queen by an appointed governor, who primarily acts on the advice of the executive council. legislative power is vested in both the government and the legislative assembly. the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. the military defence and foreign policy of the islands is the responsibility of the united kingdom. politics in the falkland islands is minimal as no political parties exist on the islands, and the governmental and legal proceedings very closely resemble british standards.
following the falklands war in 1982, lord shackleton published a report on the economy of the falkland islands which recommended many modernisations. on 1 january 1983 the falkland islanders gained british citizenship under the british nationality (falkland islands) act 1983, and on 3 october 1985 the constitution of the falkland islands was established. a new constitution came into force on 1 january 2009 which modernised the chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, embedding self-determination in the main body of the constitution. the new constitution also replaced the legislative council with the legislative assembly, and better explained the role of the governor and the chief executive.
the argentine republic claims the falkland islands (known in spanish as "islas malvinas") to be part of its territory. this claim is disputed by the falkland islanders and the united kingdom. in 1982 the islands were invaded and occupied by the argentine military junta, starting the falklands war. the islands were subsequently liberated by british forces just 74 days after the start of the war, which led to the collapse of the military dictatorship in argentina.
the sovereignty of the falklands remains in dispute, with argentina claiming the islands are an integral and indivisible part of its territory, 'illegally occupied by an occupying power'. the united kingdom and the government of the falkland islands maintains that the islanders have the right to determine the sovereignty of their birthplace. in a referendum in 2013 the people of the falkland islands soundly rejected argentina's claim to the islands, with 99.8% of voters supporting the falklands remaining an overseas territory of the united kingdom.
executive authority on the falkland islands is vested in elizabeth ii, who has been the head of state since her accession to the british throne on 6 february 1952. as the queen is absent from the islands for most of the time, executive authority is exercised "in her majesty's name and on her majesty's behalf" by the governor of the falkland islands. nigel phillips has been governor since 12 september 2017.
the governor normally acts only on the advice of the executive council of the falkland islands, which is composed of three members of the legislative assembly elected by the assembly to serve on the council every year, the chief executive, the director of finance and the governor, who acts as presiding officer. the constitution does permit the governor to act without the consulting the executive council and even go against its instructions, but in both cases the governor must immediately inform the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs in the united kingdom, who can overrule the governor's actions.
government policy and the execution thereof is primarily decided by the chief executive of the falkland islands who is the head of the public service, responsible for the efficient and effective management of the executive, acting as the islands' head of government. the chief executive is appointed by the governor on the advice of the executive council. barry rowland has been chief executive since october 2016.
the legislative branch consists of a unicameral legislative assembly. general elections must take place at least once every four years, in which the islanders elect eight members to the legislative assembly (five from stanley and three from camp) through universal suffrage using block voting. there are also two ex officio members of the assembly (the chief executive and the director of finance) who take part in proceedings but are not permitted to vote in the assembly.
the following major conventions apply to the falkland islands and should be taken into account during the drafting of legislation:
until 2009, when the new constitution came into force and created the legislative assembly, the legislature of the islands was the legislative council, which had existed since the 19th century.
the judicial branch consists of the supreme court, the court of appeal, the summary court and the magistrates' court. the judiciary is strictly independent of the executive and legislature, although it has links with the other branches of the government through the advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy. the government also employs six lawyers (the attorney general, law commissilner, two crown counsels and two legislative drafters), a policy adviser and one policy officer.
the court system of the falklands is set out by and closely resembles the system in england and wales. the supreme court of the falkland islands has unlimited jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil or criminal proceedings, and consists of the chief justice (cj) who is generally a senior barrister or solicitor with a good amount of judicial experience in the united kingdom. the cj is not resident in the falkland islands but travels to the islands if and when necessary to hear cases. the most serious criminal and civil matters are reserved for the supreme court. in civil matters, generally there is no jury however, in criminal matters, the defendant can elect trial by judge and jury or judge alone. there are only a few criminal cases which must be heard before the supreme court; these are murder, manslaughter, rape, piracy, treason and arson with the intent to endanger life. the cj also hears appeals from the magistrates' court.
from the supreme court, appeals are sent to the falkland islands court of appeal, which is based on the court of appeal of england and wales. the court of appeal consists of a president and two justices of appeal, as well as the chief justice of the supreme court who serves as an ex officio member. the president and justices of appeal are normally from the uk and are judges of the court of appeal of england and wales. appeals from the court of appeal are sent to the judicial committee of the privy council.
the falkland islands does not have its own bar or law society, but has a "falkland islands legal community". there is no differentiation between being a barrister or a solicitor; the private practitioners being called legal practitioners. the legal practitioners ordinance defines who can hold themselves out as being a legal practitioner and therefore have rights of audience before the falkland islands courts. only the chief justice of the falkland islands can prohibit a legal practitioner from practising.
in the court system on the islands, there is a panel of justices of the peace (jps) who sit in the summary court, which has no jury. jps are all non-lawyers and are made up of "upstanding members of the community". they hear the most simple of criminal cases (or sit when the senior magistrate is not in the islands) and they also act as the licensing justices who deal with alcohol-related applications, such as extended opening hours, special occasion licences, etc.
the senior magistrate (sm) is appointed by the governor and presides over the magistrates' court, which again has no jury. the sm is usually a uk qualified lawyer, with at least 10 years experience as an advocate and, usually, with some judicial experience. the sm holds office for a maximum of three years and is then replaced. the sm is resident in the islands and hears the majority of cases from simple criminal and civil matters right up to very serious criminal matters or complex civil cases. the sm also hears appeals from the summary court.
the governor has the power to grant a pardon to any person concerned in or convicted of an offence, but the governor can only use this power after consultation with the advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy. the committee consist of two elected members of the legislative assembly (appointed by the governor on the advice of the legislative assembly), the chief executive, the attorney general and the chief medical officer.
the attorney general (ag), appointed by the governor, is the main legal adviser to the falkland islands government. the ag's primary role is to determine the legality of government proceedings and action, and has the power to institute and undertake criminal proceedings before any court of law, to take over and continue any criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by another person or authority and to discontinue at any stage before judgment any criminal proceedings instituted or undertaken another person or authority. in the exercise of his or her powers, the ag is not subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority.
the attorney general is also a member of the advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy and acts as presiding officer during speaker elections in the legislative assembly, and has a constitutional right to attend all meetings of the assembly and all meetings of the executive council.
the current attorney general is simon young, who took office in december 2017.
the director of finance of the falkland islands is responsible for government expenditure on the islands, acting with authorisation from the legislative assembly. the director is also an ex officio member of both the legislative assembly and the executive council.
there is also a public accounts committee consisting of a chairman and two other members appointed by the governor (in consultation with the elected mlas) and two elected members of the legislative assembly. reporting to the legislative assembly, the committee overseas the economy, government expenditure, all public accounts and audit reports on the islands. the director of finance is not permitted to be a member of the public accounts committee.
as in many parliamentary democracies, there are no direct elections for the executive branch of the falkland islands government. instead the people elect the legislature which then advises and forms part of the executive. general elections, which elect the legislative assembly, must take place at least once every four years. suffrage is universal in the falklands, with the minimum voting age at eighteen. the legislative assembly has ten members, eight of which are elected using block voting (five from the stanley constituency and three from the camp constituency) and two "ex officio" members (the chief executive and the director of finance).
in the last general election, which took place on 9 november 2017, only non-partisans were elected as there are no active political parties in the falkland islands. the next elections is must take place on or before 21 january 2022.

the economy of the falkland islands, which first involved sealing, whaling and provisioning ships, became heavily dependent on sheep farming from the 1870s to 1980. it then diversified and now has income from tourism, commercial fishing, and servicing the fishing industry as well as agriculture. the islands use the falkland pound, which is backed by sterling.
during the 19th century, the supply and maintenance depot for ships at stanley developed into a port serving ships rounding cape horn. there was also trade in cow hides from the wild descendants of cattle introduced by french settlers in the late 18th century. sheep farming was then introduced, taking over from the cattle trade in the 1870s and becoming self-supporting by 1885. the islands also provided a base for whaling and sealing, with factories being built on east falkland and south georgia island, but these industries ended.
by the falklands war of 1982 sheep farming was the islands' only industry and their economic viability was in doubt, but after the war there was a new commitment from the united kingdom government. the falkland islands development corporation was formed in mid 1984 and in its annual report at the end of that year it set out to increase employment opportunities by encouraging diversification, to increase population levels through selective immigration, to aim for long-term self-sufficiency and to improve community facilities. to achieve this, the corporation identified agricultural improvements, tourism, self-sufficiency in energy, development of the industrial and service sector, fisheries, and land subdivision as areas to tackle.
the largest company in the islands used to be the falkland islands company (fic), a publicly quoted company on the london stock exchange. the company was responsible for the majority of the economic activity on the islands, though its farms were sold in 1991 to the falkland islands government. the company now operates several retail outlets in stanley and is involved in port services and shipping operations.
by 2002 the falklands' economy was booming, with income from tourism and the sale of squid fishing licences as well as from indigenous fishing companies with locally registered boats. fishing boats visit the islands from spain, korea, taiwan and japan, and obtain supplies and services from the islands. an islander told the bbc that "we were the luckiest people that was ever mixed up in a war". in 2007, argentina withdrew from a 1995 agreement that set terms for exploitation of offshore resources. it is thought that there might be up to of oil under the sea bed surrounding the islands. desire petroleum and rockhopper exploration began drilling for oil in the vicinity of the falklands in the first half of 2010, sparking strong protest from the argentine government.
diplomatic disputes with argentina disrupted tourism slightly in 2004. buenos aires refused permission for charter flights from chile that served cruise ships to fly over argentina to reach the islands.
the falkland islands have a gdp of $164.5 million, and a per capita gdp of $70,800 (2015 estimate) compared with the united kingdom gdp per capita of $35,200 (2009 estimate). the contributors to the gdp by sector (2010 forecast) are:
in the 2009/10 financial year, the government revenue was £42.4 million of which £14.5 million came from fishery licences and services and £10.5 million from taxes. during the same period the government expenditure was £47.6 million.
other economic indicators include:
electricity – production:
12 million kwh (2011 est.)
electricity – production by source: (2011 est.)
electricity – consumption:
11.16 million kwh (2011 est.)
the falkland islands do not have a central bank but the standard chartered bank has a single branch in stanley that offers retail, commercial and wholesale banking facilities.
the constitution requires the governor of the islands to seek the approval of a [british] secretary of state before assenting to any bill that affects ""the currency of the falkland islands or relating to the issue of banknotes"" or any bill that establishes ""any banking association or altering the constitution, rights or duties of any such association"". these restrictions effectively give the british government the ability to prevent the island's government from declaring the islands to be a tax haven or from establishing a central bank.
farmland accounts for a little over 80% of the falklands land area and a sheep appears on the islands' coat of arms, but agriculture is now less than 2% of the economy. , 670,000 sheep resided on the islands; a 2011 report estimated the sheep population at over one million.
roughly 40% of the national flock are on west falkland and 60% on east falkland. the base flock are corriedale and polwarth breeds with dohne merino, south african meat merinos, afrinos and other breeds having been introduced to improve the fineness of wool and meat characteristics. the wool price suffered a slump in 2005/6 and a peak in 2008. since 2003 the relative premium commanded by higher quality wool has increased with coarser wool missing out on the high prices in 2008. a summary of the prices for the period 2002 to 2010, which are often dictated by australian exchange rate and weather conditions is shown below:
although the production of wool is spread across the islands, the breeding of animals for slaughter is concentrated on east falkland where the eu accredited send bay abattoir is situated. an additional cost borne by producers on west falklands is the fare charged for crossing the falklands sound. as of 2010, the ferry company making the crossing charged commercial vehicles £30 per metre for a single trip plus £2 per head of sheep. wool on the other hand is charged "£45 per tonne delivered to stanley".
an increasing number of farmers are supplying lamb to the falkland islands meat company. the abattoir received export accreditation in december 2002 and began exporting meat in may 2003. the number of farms supplying lambs increased from 6 in 2003 to 27 in 2007 while the number of lambs sent to the abattoir rose from 2600 to 11,963 in the same period.
selected statistics for the year 2008/9 relating to sheep farming are given below:
there are also a small number of cows, pigs and horses on the islands that are reared for local use.
fishing is the largest part of the economy. although lord shackleton's report (1982) recommended the setting up of a fisheries limit which gave an impetus to the fishing industry, the report did not go into much detail regarding the expansion of the industry. the falkland islands development corporation which formed as a result of the shackleton report provided the impetus for the falkland islands to exploit their marine environment.
the falkland islands' fishing waters form part of the 2.7 million square kilometre patagonian shelf large marine ecosystem and are located on a spur from the patagonian continental shelf.
most of the fishing takes place in water up to deep on this spur or on the burdwood bank - another spur lying on an undersea ridge to the south of the falkland islands and separated from the islands by a deep channel known as the falklands trough. at its highest point, the burdwood bank is below sea level.
the principal ocean currents in the falkland island waters are the west wind drift, a cold current from the southern pacific ocean that flows westwards to the south of the burdwood bank and the north flowing cold falklands current, an offshoot of the west wind drift that curls around the east of falklands plateau and along the falklands and patagonian escarpments. it joins the saltier warm brazil current in the vicinity of the mouth of the río de la plata to form the south atlantic current.
in 1986 the falklands opened up their fishing industry to outsiders with the declaration of a radius fisheries conservation & management zone centered on the falkland sound. this zone was later to become the falklands inner conservation zone (ficz). apart from the falkland trough, this zone lies within the continental shelf. in 1990 the falklands outer conservation zone (focz) was declared – a zone that lay between the perimeter of the ficz and the falklands 200-nautical-mile economic zone boundary. the focz includes part of the burdwood bank, borders on the confines of the continental shelf and includes part of the falklands escarpment - a undersea escarpment running east-west.
at the same time that the focz was declared, the argentine declared its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (eez) and together with the british government (acting on behalf of the falkland islands) set up the south atlantic fisheries commission (safc) to coordinate the management of fishing stocks in the area.
most of the fish that are harvested in the falkland islands waters are either squid or finfish. other types of fish form an insignificant part of the falkland islands' catch. a significant number of the fish that are taken are migratory with the spawning grounds and feeding grounds of some species being highly dependent on the water temperature.
the illex squid ("illex argentinus") which typically has a mantle length of and a weight of is the most important fish to the falklands economy followed by its smaller cousin, the patagonian squid ("doryteuthis gahi") which typically has a mantle length of and a weight of . neither species was discovered in substantial numbers near the falklands until the late 1980s.
the lllex squid has its spawning grounds at the mouth of the río de la plata and a migratory pattern that takes it southwards along the patagonian shelf as far as the ficz to its feeding grounds. it then returns to its spawning grounds via a route that lies off the continental shelf. in some years, such as 2007, it enters the ficz with a resultant good harvest, it other years, such as 2009, it does not migrate as far south as the ficz at all. the catch for the 2010 season in the falklands recovered to 12105 tonnes, but still the fourth lowest since the beginning of the licensing system. this has been attributed to the lower than usual sea temperatures during the feeding season in february–may.
the patagonian squid, unlike the illex, remain in falkland island waters all year and are concentrated in the "loloigo box"—an area within the falklands plateau to the east and south-east of the islands and are harvested during both the austral spring and autumn.
in the 1970s many fin fish, particularly the rock cod, a high volume low value fish were exploited to near-extinction. the levels of rock cod taken in the whole of the south atlantic dropped by 99.3% in the space of two years between the 1969–70 and 1971–72 seasons. while the patagonian rockcod was fished to near-extinction in the shag rock area. this resulted in a ban on fishing which was lifted in 2005. following the collapse of the illex industry in 2008/9, the rock cod has become, by weight, the most heavily harvested species in the area.
in 2006, a spanish vessel on an exploratory trawl found commercial quantities of grenadiers ("macrourus spp., coelorhynchus spp.") to the south and east of the falkland islands at depths between depths in the eastern part of ficz. it has been estimated that this species needs a stock biomass of 40000 tonnes to produce a sustainable harvest of 3000 tonnes per annum and is now reflected as a separate entry in the tables below.
with the establishment of the ficz, the falklands fisheries department issued licences that enable foreign vessels to fish in falklands waters. initially there were seven classes of licence, but as of the 2009 season, this was increased to ten classes of licence. each class of licence has its own characteristics – species or combination of species that may be taken, net sizes that may be used and seasons when the licence is valid. the main fishing areas are in waters that are up to deep with principal concentrations close to the confluence of the focz, ficz and eez to the north west of the islands and also on the burwood bank – a shallow water to the south of the islands.
initially licences were issued on a total allowable effort (tae) but in 2007, the toothfish longline fishery became the first fishery in the falkland islands to be issued on a total allowable catch (tac) basis.
apart from the islander's own fleet, the principal fishing fleets come from spain, korea and taiwan. when the falkland islands first opened up her waters, the polish fishing fleet had a presence as did the japanese, but the poles stopped fishing in the area in the mid-1990s and the japanese in the middle of the first decade of the twenty-first century. by 2002 the license revenue was so great that the island government had no debt and had built up more than £80 million in savings.
since 1993, the principal licence classes have been:
revenue from licence fees (£ millions)
the antarctic treaty was signed by both the united kingdom and argentina in 1959. in its wake, the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources (ccamlr), a treaty signed by 24 nations and covering the area that includes most of the falkland islands waters, came into force in 1982, having been signed by the united kingdom on 31 august 1981 and argentina on 28 may 1982. the convention covers southern ocean ecosystem which is generally accepted as being south of approximately 50° to 55°s. the ccamlr provides a forum for exchanging information regarding marine life in the antarctic region and has the authority to ban the harvesting of certain type of fish and also to ban or put restrictions on the use of certain methods of harvesting. the convention requires that member states who are not parties to the antarctic treaty accept certain provisions of that treaty.
the south atlantic fisheries commission (safc) was set up in 1990 between the argentine and the united kingdom (acting on behalf of the falkland islands) to exchange information and to coordinate fishing activities in the south atlantic. one of their prime activities was the monitoring of the illex spawning stock biomass (ssb). if the ssb drops below a threshold of 40000 tonnes the safc recommend will early closure of the fishing season. since 2005 the safc has been largely moribund as the argentine government reduced co-operation, declining to continue the routine joint meeting process and suspending joint scientific activities. she has since extended her claim to all of the falkland island waters.
the table below shows the average catch in tonnes of various species (as categorised by fifd - falkland island fishing department) for successive five-year periods.
tourism is the second-largest part of the economy. in 1982, an average of only 500 tourists visited the falklands per annum but by 2007, this figure had grown to 55,000 and the falkland islands tourist board hired its first tourism director that year. in 2010, the transport and hospitality sector was expected to contribute £7.8 million or 7.7% of the island's gdp. tourism forms a significant part of this figure with land-based visitors expected to contribute £2.7 million to the islands’ economy in 2010. the islands have become a regular port of call for the growing market of cruise ships to antarctica and elsewhere in the south atlantic. attractions include the scenery and wildlife conservation including 1,000,000 penguins, seabirds, seals, and sea lions, as well as visits to battlefields, golf, fishing and wreck diving. in addition to accommodation in stanley, there are tourist lodges at port howard, darwin, pebble island, carcass island, and sea lion island. self-catering accommodation at holiday cottages on island farms. the total contribution of tourism to the islands’ is expected to reach £5.4 million in 2010.
during the 2008-2009 season almost 69,000 tourists visited the falklands, with 62,600 of these arriving onboard cruise or expedition vessels. since cruise liners have their own accommodation, substantial numbers of tourists can be accommodated at once, such as an occasion in 2005 when 3000 tourists visited the islands in one day. in 2013 passengers from cruise ships faced protests in latin american ports over the british military presence. the cruise industry is expecting passenger numbers to decline from 39,500 in 2013-2014 to 34,000 for 2014-2015. however land tourism is increasing which is offsetting the effect of a decrease in cruise tourism.
other sources of "tourist" revenue include spending by the british military personnel based on the islands, by business travellers and by pilgrims to the graves of both british and argentine soldiers who fell in the 1982 falklands war. although there is still a resentment in the islands to the argentine occupation, the falkland islands government continues ""to respect the need for argentine veterans of the 1982 conflict and their next of kin to visit the battlefield sites and the cemetery at darwin"". such visits are arranged in conjunction with lan airlines (chile) who, on such occasions, use larger aircraft than normal for the weekly flights.
four sedimentary basins that could potentially contain hydrocarbons have been identified in the falkland island waters. they are:
the latter three basins are part of a larger contiguous formation.
an agreement signed in 1995 with argentina had set the terms for exploitation of offshore resources including large oil reserves as it was thought that there might be up to of oil under the sea bed surrounding the islands. however, in 2007 argentina unilaterally withdrew from the agreement. in response, falkland oil and gas has signed an agreement with bhp billiton to investigate the potential exploitation of oil reserves. climatic conditions of the southern seas mean that exploitation will be a difficult task, though economically viable, and the continuing sovereignty dispute with argentina is hampering progress.
some 2012 exploration results have indicated that taxation on oil revenues, even though they will be amongst the lowest in the world, are expected to more than double the country's revenue.
in february 2010, exploratory drilling for oil was begun by desire petroleum, but the results from the first test well were disappointing. two months later, on 6 may 2010, when rockhopper exploration announced that ""it may have struck oil"", argentina's foreign minister warned that his country would take all possible lawful steps to impede british oil exploration and production there. on 17 september 2010, rockhopper exploration published the results of the borehole analysis – the well was drilled in water 451 m deep and a flow test showed that a payable oil column of 53 m was capable of producing over . in february 2011 rockhopper exploration commenced an appraisal programme of the sea-lion discovery. an update of the first appraisal drill was released on monday 21 march 2011 indicating a significant reservoir package with a downhole mini drill stern test flowing oil at better rates then the september 2010 flow test: confidence in the commerciality of the sea lion discovery has been increased by this first appraisal.
on 14 september 2011 rockhopper exploration announced plans are under way for oil production to commence in 2016, through the use of floating production storage and offloading (fpso) technology, replicating the methodology used on the foinaven oilfield off the shetland islands. the proposal envisages a fpso vessel located 200 km offshore servicing 24 production wells and 12 water injection wells in about 450 m of water. the wells will be arranged in clusters of 6 wells per drill centre. the two water injection well clusters will be 3.0 km from the four oil well clusters. oil will be transferred from the fpso vessel to shuttle oil tankers. each year thereafter the production date has been pushed back another year.
the production site will require approximately 110 people working offshore and another 40 working onshore. the oil expected to trade at of the brent crude price.
in may 2015 oil was discovered in isobel deep in may 2015 by a consortium of oil companies including falkland oil and gas, premier oil, and rockhopper oil & gas.
as of 2011 the east and south falklands fields had not been fully evaluated; "leiv eiriksson", a 5th generation semi-submersible drilling rig, is expected to drill two exploratory wells for falkland oil and gas in 2012.
the islands have been investing in windpower – in 2010, three 330 kw wind turbines were installed at sand bay, about 10 km from stanley on the opposite side of the valley from three turbines that were installed in 2007. the island's government has plans to install a 2 mwh battery storage system which will allow surplus wind energy to be stored. the first three turbines resulted in a 20% reduction in the stanley power station's energy consumption and it was hoped that the second set of three turbines would double this figure. in parallel, there are on-going investigations into other forms of renewable energy for remote locations on the islands.
in october 1877, the secretary of state of the colonial office, the earl of carnarvon began the process of application for the falkland islands to join the general postal union (renamed universal postal union in 1879). the first stamps, 1d, 6d, and 1 shilling values featuring the usual profile of queen victoria, were issued 19 june 1878. since then the islands have issued their own stamps, which are a source of revenue from overseas collectors. between 2000 and 2008, the islands issued between six and eight sets of commemorative stamps. the workload placed on the falkland islands post office by overseas collectors led to the establishments in 1978 of the falkland islands philatelic bureau. the bureau also handles philately-related sales on behalf of the governments of government of south georgia and the south sandwich islands and of the british antarctic territory.
coins and banknotes may only be issued by the falkland islands government with the authorisation of the british government. coins for local use were first struck in 1974 and are the same size as the corresponding british coins. there is a flourishing business in the issue of commemorative coins struck on behalf of the falkland island government for collectors – in particular the 2007 series of coins that commemorated the 25th anniversary of the liberation of islands attracted much attention. the falkland islands government (fig) is required to deposit 110% of the face value of any coins struck on its behalf into its currency fund, thereby effectively backing the falkland pound with the pound sterling. in the case of commemorative coins that are unlikely to be redeemed, this money represents a long-term investment. in many cases the set-up and production costs are carried by the mint concerned, who pay the fig a royalty on coins that it sells to collectors.

telecommunications in the falkland islands includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the internet.
the falkland islands radio service (firs) operates a radio network in conjunction with the bbc world service, while the british forces broadcasting service (bfbs) operates three networks of its own. ktv ltd. also operates two relay stations, ktv radio nova, a rebroadcast of bbc world service, and ktv radio nova saint fm, a rebroadcast of saint fm.
five channels are provided by bfbs: bbc one, bbc two, itv, bfbs extra, and sky news for non-military. entitled personnel within british forces south atlantic can also receive sky sports 1, sky sports 2 and bfbs sport.

the falkland islands currently has three primary means of transport - road, sea and air. however, in 1946, when sir miles clifford arrived as governor, there were no air services, no roads outside stanley and an indifferent sea service. sir miles was instrumental in starting the falkland islands government air service in december 1948. the inaugural flight involved a mercy flight from north arm settlement to stanley to bring a girl with peritonitis to life-saving medical help in stanley. there are now an international airport, a domestic airport, a number of airstrips, a growing road network and a much-improved ferry service between the two main islands.
in 1982, the falkland islands had no roads outside stanley, only tracks. by 2007, the falkland islands had a road network of with a further roads planned for construction link to all occupied mainland settlements by 2013. in 2012, the falkland islands government classified the road network - east falkland and west falkland - into "a" roads, "b" roads and "c" roads for purposes of "highways asset management plan". the "a" roads are the link between stanley and new haven (east falkland) and the link between port howard and fox bay (west falkland).
all roads within stanley are asphalted as are the ones at mount pleasant airport (mpa). the road between stanley and mpa is mostly gravel all-weather roads (as like the rest of the roads in the islands) with some short asphalted sections. the road between stanley and mpa has a large trench on either side, which will ground any vehicle driving into it. these trenches were allegedly dug deeper than they needed to be as annual rainfall was taken as a number for the monthly rainfall.
stanley has two taxi services which can be used for travel within the town and the surrounding areas. a variety of four-wheel drive vehicles can be hired in stanley, which are essential for travel along unpaved roads that are potentially badly potholed.
a bus service ferries passengers between the main airport for international flights at mount pleasant and stanley.
bicycles can also be hired, though because of the unsealed roads and hilly terrain, these are more suitable for use around the stanley area.
speed limits are 25 mph (40 km/h) in built-up areas and 40 mph (64 km/h) elsewhere.
there are two seaports in the falkland islands, stanley (east falkland) and fox bay (west falkland). the designated harbours in stanley area include berkeley sound, port william and stanley harbour itself. fox bay is also a customs entry point for west falkland. the falkland islands do not have a merchant navy.
since november 2008, a regular ferry service has linked the two main islands, carrying cars, passengers and cargo. the ferry, "mv concordia bay", a 42.45 m twin-screw shallow draft (2.59 m) landing craft runs between port howard in west falkland and new haven in east falkland. she has a deck, 30 m in length and 10 m in width which is sufficient for 16 one-ten land rovers (or equivalent) and accommodation for 30 passengers. she also has a crane that is capable of lifting 10 tonnes at 7 m. she also visits some of the smaller islands.
other smaller boats may be chartered in advance.
tourist cruise ships often visit many of the islands, making use of inflatable boats where adequate docking facilities are not available.
a gauge railway, known as the camber railway, was built along the north side of stanley harbour in 1915-1916 and used until the 1920s. it was about long. the trackbed is still visible.
the falkland islands have two airports with paved runways. the main international airport is raf mount pleasant, west of stanley.
lan airlines operate weekly flights to punta arenas. once a month, this flight also stops in río gallegos, argentina.
the royal air force operates flights from raf mount pleasant to raf brize norton in oxfordshire, england, with a refuelling stop at dakar, senegal, because the runway at raf ascension island is closed until at least 2019. this service is called the south atlantic airbridge.
as of 2011 titan airways operates the raf air link, using boeing 767s. british international (brintel) also operate two sikorsky s61n helicopters, based at raf mount pleasant, under contract to the united kingdom ministry of defence, primarily for moving military personnel, equipment and supplies around the islands.
the smaller port stanley airport, outside the city, is used mainly for internal flights. the falkland islands government air service (figas) operates islander aircraft that can use the grass airstrips that most settlements have. flight schedules are decided a day in advance according to passenger needs and the next day's timetable is published every evening. the schedules are based on three routes - a northern shuttle and the southern shuttle that each have one flight a day and the east - west shuttle that has a morning and an evening flight every day.
the british antarctic survey operates a transcontinental air link between port stanley airport and the rothera research station on the antarctic peninsula and servicing also other british bases in the british antarctic territory using a de havilland canada dash 7.

the falkland islands are a british overseas territory and, as such, rely on the uk for the guarantee of their security. the other uk territories in the south atlantic, south georgia and the south sandwich islands, fall under the protection of british forces south atlantic islands (bfsai), formerly known as british forces falkland islands (bffi), which includes commitments from the british army, royal air force and royal navy. they are headed by the commander of the british forces south atlantic islands (cbfsai).
argentina invaded and took control of the falklands on 2 april 1982. after recapturing the territory in june 1982, the uk invested heavily in the defence of the islands, the centrepiece of which was a new airfield at raf mount pleasant, west of stanley. the base was opened in 1985, and became fully operational in 1986.
the falkland islands maintains its own part-time volunteer force, the falkland islands defence force (fidf), previously known as the falkland islands volunteer corps. although this unit existed in 1982 as a reinforcement for the governor's detachment of royal marines, it did not play any part in the main conflict during the war of 1982, its members having spent the duration of the hostilities under house arrest by the argentines after their surrender on the argentine capture of the islands. the fidf is now a company-strength light infantry force with a permanent training warrant officer seconded from the royal marines. the fidf operates in a number of roles and is fully integrated into the defence scheme for the islands. the fidf has been trained by the royal navy to operate oerlikon 20 mm cannon and to board vessels suspected of fishery poaching.
raf mount pleasant has its own port facility called mare harbour, operated by naval party 2010 (np2010). the royal navy maintains a presence in the area with a frigate or guided missile destroyer accompanied by an rfa vessel in the south atlantic and a patrol ship, currently hms "clyde", permanently close to the islands. in addition, an ice patrol ship, , is on station close to antarctica for six months of the year.
the warship and rfa vessel carry out the atlantic patrol task (south) mission, which "provides a maritime presence to protect the uk's interests in the region". the type 42 destroyer hms "edinburgh" took over the south atlantic patrol task in october 2006, replacing hms "southampton". prior to "southampton's" deployment in august 2005, the role was filled by hms "cardiff", which was decommissioned on return to the uk. as of february 2010, the on-station warship was the type 42 destroyer hms "york". in late april 2010, hms york was relieved by the type 23 frigate hms "portland". in august 2010, hms portland was relieved by the type 42 destroyer hms "gloucester". on 21 april 2011, hms "york" arrived at the east cove military port in the falkland islands, beginning patrol duties for the islands. october 2011 saw the arrival of the type 23 frigate hms "montrose", generating a statement from unasur (union of south american nations). the type 45 guided missile destroyer hms "dauntless" replaced hms montrose as of april 2012. in early august 2013, hms richmond was deployed to be the ship for the royal navy's atlantic patrol. hms portland was again deployed in january 2014.
the falkland islands patrol ship is a river-class patrol vessel, which replaced the previous castle-class patrol vessel. in 2007, hms "clyde" relieved hms "dumbarton castle" and hms "leeds castle". it is planned to be replaced by hms forth in 2018.
the royal navy also has "trafalgar" and "astute"-class nuclear submarines that it can deploy to the area, though such deployments are classified. the threat from submarines to hostile ships was demonstrated during the falklands war when hms "conqueror" sank the argentine cruiser ara "general belgrano". the royal navy's submarines also carry bgm-109 tomahawk cruise missiles, which have a range of and can strike at targets within an enemy country. "the sun" newspaper has speculated that a "swiftsure"-class attack submarine, hms "sceptre", was sent to the islands in march 2010. in february 2012, a "trafalgar"-class nuclear submarine may have been deployed to the falkland islands.
the british army maintains a garrison on the falkland islands based at mount pleasant. the total deployment is about 1,200 personnel made up of a "roulement" infantry company, an engineer squadron, a signals unit (part of the joint communications unit – see below), a logistics group and supporting services.
the british army contributes to the joint service explosive ordnance disposal group (see below) in the falkland islands, providing 33 engineer regiment (eod) and rlc eod teams. this has been reduced to a team of 11 personnel.
raf mount pleasant was built in 1985 with the capability of accepting large trans-atlantic aircraft such as the lockheed tristar. the tristar was purchased mainly for the uk-falklands route; until their entry into service, the uk used leased 747s and 767s.
originally lockheed hercules c.1k were used for air-to-air refuelling missions, but these were later replaced by a vc10. on 31 august 2013 the vc10 was replaced by a tristar k.1 which was itself replaced by a voyager kc.2 in february 2014. when a fighter is launched, it is almost immediately followed by the tanker as changeable weather conditions might make diversion to another airfield necessary. the voyager however will be unable to fit within a hangar at raf mount pleasant.
four typhoon aircraft provide air defence for the islands and surrounding territories and have a secondary ground attack role.
the helicopters of no. 1564 flight (formerly no. 78 squadron) provided air transport missions. the sea kings carried out short and medium range search and rescue missions, until their retirement. aar corp was awarded a contract for helicopter search and rescue services in the falkland islands to replace 1564 flight, using agustawestland aw189 helicopters in the role from 2016. in march 2015, the uk announced that a pair of chinooks would be stationed in the falklands again, the first of which started flying in june 2016. 1564 flight disbanded in march 2016.
a c-130 hercules was used for transport, search and rescue and maritime patrol until replaced with an a400m atlas c1 in april 2018.
the joint communications unit falkland islands (jcufi) provides the electronic warfare and command and control systems for the royal navy, army and raf stationed there. it incorporates the army's signals unit and raf personnel.
joint service explosive ordnance disposal in the falkland islands consists of 33 engineer regiment (eod), raf and rlc eod teams. it is mainly based in stanley, but there is also a detachment at mount pleasant. the groups operates the joint service explosive ordnance disposal operations centre. the group destroys munitions from the falklands war that did not explode at the time and briefs troops, tourists and citizens on the areas that are safe and the minefield markings that have been put in place.
the uk maintains a joint rapid reaction force, which contains elements of all three services, that could be deployed to the islands in the event of receiving intelligence of a specific threat to the islands.
the following have served as commander british forces falkland islands/south atlantic islands:

the early details of the history of the faroe islands are unclear. it is possible that brendan, an irish monk, sailed past the islands during his north atlantic voyage in the 6th century. he saw an 'island of sheep' and a 'paradise of birds,' which some say could be the faroes with its dense bird population and sheep. this does suggest however that other sailors had got there before him, to bring the sheep. norsemen settled the faroe islands in the 9th century or 10th century. the islands were officially converted to christianity around the year 1000, and became a part of the kingdom of norway in 1035. norwegian rule on the islands continued until 1380, when the islands became part of the dual denmark–norway kingdom, under king olaf ii of denmark.
following the 1814 treaty of kiel that ended the dual denmark–norway kingdom, the faroe islands remained under the administration of denmark as a county. during world war ii, after denmark was occupied by nazi germany, the british invaded and occupied the faroe islands until shortly after the end of the war. following an independence referendum in 1946 that took place unrecognized by denmark, the faroe islands were in 1948 granted extended self-governance with the danish realm with the signing of the "home rule act of the faroe islands".
archaeological evidence has been found of settlers living on the faroe islands in two successive periods prior to the arrival of the norse, the first between 400–600 ad and the second between 600–800 ad. scientists from aberdeen university have also found early cereal pollen from domesticated plants, which further suggests people may have lived on the islands before the vikings arrived. archaeologist mike church noted that dicuil (see below) mentioned what may have been the faroes. he also suggested that the people living there might have been from ireland, scotland or scandinavia, with possibly groups from all three areas settling there.
there is a latin account of a voyage made by saint brendan, an irish monastic saint who lived around 484–578, there is a description of "insulae" (islands) resembling the faroe islands. this association, however, is far from conclusive in its description.
the earliest text which has been claimed to be a description of the faroe islands was written by an irish monk in the frankish kingdom named dicuil, who, around 825, described certain islands in the north in "liber de mensura orbis terrae", (measure/description of the sphere of the earth). dicuil had met a "man worthy of trust" who related to his master, the abbot sweeney (suibhne), how he had landed on the faroe islands after having navigated "two days and a summer night in a little vessel of two banks of oars" ("in duobus aestivis diebus, et una intercedente nocte, navigans in duorum navicula transtrorum").
"many other islands lie in the northerly british ocean. one reaches them from the northerly islands of britain, by sailing directly for two days and two nights with a full sail in a favourable wind the whole time... most of these islands are small, they are separated by narrow channels, and for nearly a hundred years hermits lived there, coming from our land, ireland, by boat. but just as these islands have been uninhabited from the beginning of the world, so now the norwegian pirates have driven away the monks; but countless sheep and many different species of sea-fowl are to be found there..."
norse settlement of the faroe islands is recorded in the færeyinga saga, whose original manuscript is lost. portions of the tale were inscribed in three other sagas: such as flateyjarbók, saga of óláfr tryggvason, and am 62 fol. similar to other sagas, the historical credibility of the færeyinga saga is highly questioned.
both the saga of ólafr tryggvason and flateyjarbók claim that grímur kamban was the first man to discover the faroe islands. the two sources disagree, however, on the year in which he left and the circumstances of his departure. flateyjarbók details the emigration of grímur kamban as sometime during the reign of harald hårfagre, between 872–930 ce. the saga of óláfr tryggvason indicates that kamban was residing in the faroes long before the rule of harald hårfagre, and that other norse were driven to the faroe islands due to his chaotic rule. this mass migration to the faroe islands shows a prior knowledge of the viking settlements' locations, furthering the claim of grímur kamban's settlement much earlier. while kamban is recognized as the first viking settler of the faroe islands, his surname is of gaelic origin. writings from the papar, an order of irish monks, show that they left the faroe islands due to ongoing viking raids.
the name of the islands is first recorded on the hereford "mappa mundi" (1280), where they are labelled "farei".
the name has long been understood as based on old norse "fár" "livestock", thus "fær-øer" "sheep islands".
the main historical source for this period is the 13th-century work "færeyinga saga" ("saga of the faroese"), though it is disputed as to how much of this work is historical fact.
"færeyinga saga" only exists today as copies in other sagas, in particular the manuscripts called "saga of óláfr tryggvason", "flateyjarbók" and one registered as am 62 fol.
according to flateyjarbók, grímr kamban settled in faroe when harald hårfagre was king of norway (872–930). a slightly different account is found in the version of "færeyinga saga" in ólafs saga tryggvasonar:
the text suggests that grímr kamban settled in the faroes some time before the flight from harald hårfagre, perhaps even hundreds of years before. his first name, "grímr", is norse, but his last, "kamban", suggests a gaelic origin ("cambán"). he may have been of mixed norse and irish origin and have come from a settlement in the british isles: a so-called norse-gael. the norse-gaels had intermarried with speakers of irish, a language also spoken at the time in scotland (being the ancestor of scottish gaelic). evidence of a mixed cultural background in later settlers may be found in the norse-irish ring pins found in the faroe islands, and in features of faroese vocabulary. examples of such words (derived from middle irish) are: "blak/blaðak" (buttermilk), irish "bláthach"; "drunnur" (animal tail), irish "dronn" (chine); "grúkur" (head), irish "gruaig" (hair); "lámur" (hand, paw), irish "lámh" (hand); "tarvur" (bull), irish "tarbh"; and "ærgi" (pasture in the outfield), irish "áirge" (byre, milking place: mod. irish "áirí"). the discovery at toftanes on eysturoy of wooden devotional crosses apparently modelled on irish or scottish exemplars suggests that some of the settlers were christian. it has also been suggested that the typical curvilinear stone-built walls enclosing early ecclesiastical sites in the faroes (as in norse settlements elsewhere) reflect a celtic christian style, seen in the circular enclosures of early ecclesiastical sites in ireland. indirect support for this theory has been found in genetic research showing that many norse settler women in the faroe islands had celtic forebears.
if there was settlement in the faroes in the reign of harald hårfagre, it is possible that people already knew about the faroes because of previous visitors or settlers.
the fact that immigrants from norway also settled in the faroe islands is proven by a runestone ("see sandavágur stone") found in the village of sandavágur on vágoy island. it says:
this description "eastman" (from norway) has to be seen together with the description "westman" (from ireland/scotland), which is to be found in local place-names such as "vestmanna-havn" i.e. "irishmen's harbour" in the faroe isles, and "vestmannaeyjar" i.e. "irishmen's islands" in iceland.
according to "færeyinga saga" there was an ancient institution on the headland called tinganes in tórshavn on the island of streymoy. this was an "alþing" or althing (all-council.) this was the place where laws were made and disputes solved. all free men had the right to meet in the alþing. it was a parliament and law court for all, thus the name. historians estimate the alþing to have been established from 800 to 900.
the islands were officially converted to christianity around the year 1000, with the diocese of the faroe islands based at kirkjubøur, southern streymoy, of which there were 33 catholic bishops.
the faroes became a part of the kingdom of norway in 1035. early in the 11th century sigmund or sigmundur brestisson, whose family had flourished in the southern islands but had been almost exterminated by invaders from the islands of the north, was sent from norway, to where he had escaped, to take possession of the islands for olaf tryggvason, king of norway. he introduced christianity, and, though he was subsequently murdered, norwegian supremacy was upheld and continued.
king sverre of norway was brought up in the faroes, being stepson of a faroese man, and relative to roe, bishop of the islands.
the 14th century saw the start of what would prove to be a long era of foreign encroachment on the faroese economy. at this time trading regulations were set up so that all faroese commerce had to pass through bergen, norway in order to collect customs tax. meanwhile, the hanseatic league was gaining in power, threatening scandinavian commerce. though norway tried to halt this, it was forced to desist after the black death decimated its population.
norwegian supremacy continued until 1380, when the islands became part of the dual monarchy denmark–norway. the islands were still a possession of the norwegian crown since the crowns had not been joined. in 1380 the alþting was renamed the løgting, though it was by now little more than a law court.
in 1390s, henry sinclair i, earl of orkney, took possession of the islands (as vassal of norway, however) and for some time they were part of the sinclair principality in the north atlantic.
archaeological excavations on the islands indicate sustained pig keeping up to and beyond the 13th century, a unique situation when compared to iceland and greenland. the faroese at junkarinsfløtti remained dependent upon bird resources, especially puffins, far longer and to a greater degree than with any of the other viking age settlers of the north atlantic islands.
english adventurers gave great trouble to the inhabitants in the 16th century, and the name of magnus heinason, a native of streymoy, who was sent by frederick ii to clear the seas, is still celebrated in many songs and stories.
in 1535 christian ii, the deposed monarch, tried to regain power from king christian iii who had just succeeded his father frederick i. several of the powerful german companies backed christian ii, but he eventually lost. the new king christian iii gave the german trader thomas köppen exclusive trading rights in the faroes. these rights were subject to the following conditions: only good quality goods were to be supplied by the faroese and were to be made in numbers proportionate to the rest of the market; the goods were to be bought at their market value; and the traders were to deal fairly and honestly with the faroese.
christian iii also introduced lutheranism to the faroes, to replace catholicism. this process took five years to complete, in which time danish was used instead of latin and church property was transferred to the state. the bishopric at kirkjubøur, south of tórshavn, where remains of the cathedral may be seen, was also abolished.
after köppen, others took over the trading monopoly, though the economy suffered as a result of the war between denmark and sweden. during this period of the monopoly most faroese goods (wool products, fish, meat) were taken to the netherlands, where they were sold at pre-determined prices. the guidelines of the trading agreement, however, were often ignored or corrupted. this caused delays and shortages in the supply of faroese goods and a reduction in quality. with the trading monopoly nearing collapse smuggling and piracy were rife.
denmark tried to solve the problem by giving the faroes to the courtier christoffer gabel (and later on his son, frederick) as a personal feudal estate. however, the gabel rule was harsh and repressive, breeding much resentment in the faroese. this caused denmark, in 1708, to entrust the islands and trading monopoly once more to the central government. however, they too struggled to keep the economy going, and many merchants were trading at a loss. finally, on 1 january 1856 the trading monopoly was abolished.
denmark retained possession of the faroes at the peace of kiel in 1814, but lost continental norway.
in 1816 the løgting (the faroese parliament) was officially abolished and replaced by a danish judiciary. danish was introduced as the main language, whilst faroese was discouraged. in 1849 a new constitution came into use in denmark and was promulgated in the faroes in 1850, giving the faroese two seats in the rigsdag (danish parliament). the faroese, however, managed in 1852 to re-establish the løgting as a county council with an advisory role, with many people hoping for eventual independence. the late 19th century saw increasing support for the home rule/independence movement, though not all were in favour. meanwhile, the faroese economy was growing with the introduction of large-scale fishing. the faroese were allowed access to the large danish waters in the north atlantic. living standards subsequently improved and there was a population increase. faroese became a standardised written language in 1890, but it was not allowed to be used in the faroese public schools until 1938, and in the church (fólkakirkjan) until 1939.
during the second world war denmark was invaded and occupied by nazi germany. the british subsequently made a pre-emptive (but friendly) invasion and occupation of the faroes to prevent a german invasion. given their strategic location in the north atlantic, the faroes could have proved useful to germany in the battle of the atlantic, possibly as a submarine base. instead, the british forces built an airbase on vágar, which is still in use as vágar airport. faroese fishing boats also provided a large amount of fish to the uk, which was crucial given food rationing.
the løgting gained legislative powers, with the danish prefect carl aage hilbert retaining executive power. the faroese flag was recognized by british authorities. there were some attempts to declare complete independence in this period, but the uk had given an undertaking not to interfere in the internal affairs of the faroe islands nor to act without the permission of a liberated denmark. the experience of wartime self-government was crucial in paving the way for formal autonomy in 1948.
the british presence was broadly popular (particularly given the alternative of a german occupation). approximately 150 marriages took place between british soldiers and faroese women, although the scale of the british presence on vágar did lead to some local tensions. the british presence also left a lasting popularity for british chocolate and sweets, which is readily available in faroese shops but uncommon in denmark.
following the liberation of denmark and the end of world war ii, the last british troops left in september 1945. until 1948 the faroes had the official status of a danish amt (county). a referendum on full independence was held in 1946, which produced a majority in favour. this was, however, not recognised by the danish government or king due to only 2/3 of the population participating in the referendum, so the danish king abolished the government of the faroes. the subsequent elections løgting were won by an anti-independence majority and instead a high degree of self-governance was attained in 1948 with the passing of the act of faroese home rule. faroese was now an official language, though danish is still taught as a second language in schools. the faroese flag was also officially recognised by danish authorities.
in 1973 denmark joined the european community (now european union). the faroes refused to join, mainly over the issue of fishing limits.
the 1980s saw an increase in support for faroese independence. unemployment was very low, and the faroese were enjoying one of the world's highest standards of living, but the faroese economy was almost entirely reliant on fishing. the early 1990s saw a dramatic slump in fish stocks, which were being overfished with new high-tech equipment. during the same period the government was also engaged in massive overspending. national debt was now at 9.4 billion danish krones (dkk). finally, in october 1992, the faroese national bank (sjóvinnurbankin) called in receivers and was forced to ask denmark for a huge financial bailout. the initial sum was 500 million dkk, though this eventually grew to 1.8 billion dkk (this was in addition to the annual grant of 1 billion dkk). austerity measures were introduced: public spending was cut, there was a tax and vat increase and public employees were given a 10% wage-cut. much of the fishing industry was put into receivership, with talk of cutting down the number of fish-farms and ships.
it was during this period that many faroese (6%) decided to emigrate, mainly to denmark. unemployment rose, up to as much as 20% in tórshavn, with it being higher in the outlying islands.
in 1993 the sjóvinnurbankin merged with the faroes islands' second largest bank, føroya banki. a third was declared bankrupt. meanwhile, there was a growing international boycott of faroese produce because of the grindadráp (whaling) issue. the independence movement dissolved on the one hand while denmark found itself left with the faroe islands' unpaid bills on the other.
recuperative measures were put in place and largely worked. unemployment peaked in january 1994 at 26%, since which it fell (10% in mid-1996, 5% in april 2000). the fishing industry survived largely intact. fish stocks also rose, with the annual catch being 100,000 in 1994, rising to 150,000 in 1995. in 1998 it was 375,000. emigration also fell to 1% in 1995, and there was a small population increase in 1996. in addition, oil was discovered nearby. by the early 21st century weaknesses in the faroese economy had been eliminated and, accordingly, many minds turned once again to the possibility of independence from denmark. however, a planned referendum in 2001 on first steps towards independence was called off following danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen saying that danish money grants would be phased out within four years if there were a 'yes' vote.

the faroe islands are an island group consisting of eighteen islands between the norwegian sea and the north atlantic, about half-way between iceland and norway. its coordinates are . it is 1,393 square kilometres in area, and includes small lakes and rivers, but no major ones. there are 1,117 kilometres of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country.
the faroe islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent fog and strong winds. although at a high latitude, due to the gulf stream their climate is ameliorated. the islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly bordered by cliffs. the faroe islands are notable for having the highest sea cliffs in europe, and some of the highest in the world otherwise. the lowest point is at sea level, and the highest is at slættaratindur, which is 882 metres above sea level. the landscape made roadbuilding difficult, and only recently has this been remedied by building tunnels.
many of the faroese islands tend to be elongated in shape. natural resources include fish and hydropower.
tórshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. snow is also seen at a much higher frequency than outlying islands nearby. the area receives on average 49 frosts a year.
while receiving more frost than most of the faroe islands, mykines is more temperate in the winter than nearby vágar. snow is also less common despite the relatively lower winter temperatures due to the relatively low precipitation in the area. it also has a very mild tundra climate bordering on subpolar oceanic. frost occurs on 46 days in an average year it is also likely that the lower areas of the island experience less than this, as the weather station is located at 105 meters above sea level.
akraberg is milder than much of the faroe islands and experiences frost on 38 days in an average year, possibly less in lower areas, as the weather station is located at an elevation of 101 meters above sea level.
vágar has colder and snowier winters than most other places in the archipelago. lower temperatures combined with higher precipitation are responsible for this, and measurable snow cover can be seen- a rarity in the faroe islands, in which snow cover (in areas which regularly experience it) is usually limited to a thin coating. the airport, at which data is recorded, is also located at a higher altitude on the island (84 meters above sea level), which might result in lower temperatures and higher precipitation than lower-lying areas on the island. frost occurs on average on 62 days of the year, the most out of all stations included in the records of the danish meteorological institute.
kirkja has a very mild climate, similar to akraberg. it has the lowest frequency of frosts out of all weather stations included in the records by the danish meteorological institute, with 36 days of frost in an average year. snowfall is uncommon, due to mild temperatures and relatively low precipitation. the weather station is somewhat high at 53 meters above sea level, which could possibly affect the data, but not as much as the previous stations.
nólsoy experiences a climate that is quite typical of the surrounding area and the faroe islands in general, and is similar to nearby tórshavn. there are on average 44 days of frost a year. also, as in the case of previous weather stations, the location is higher on its respective island, and the climate of the lower areas of the island differs slightly.
the climate of sandur is typical for a low-lying coastal location in the south of the faroe islands, as the weather station for sandur is located at 5 meters above sea level. on average, sandur experiences 41 days of frost a year.

this article is about the demographic features of the population of the faroe islands, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
recent dna analysis have revealed that y chromosomes, tracing male descent, are 87% scandinavian.
the studies show that mitochondrial dna, tracing female descent, is 84% scottish / irish.
of the approximately 48,000 inhabitants of the faroe islands (16,921 private households (2004)), 98% are danish realm citizens, meaning faroese, danish, or greenlandic. by birthplace one can derive the following origins of the inhabitants: born on the faroes 91.7%, in denmark 5.8%, and in greenland 0.3%. the largest group of foreigners are icelanders comprising 0.4% of the population, followed by norwegians and poles, each comprising 0.2%. altogether, on the faroe islands there are people from 77 different nationalities. the faroe islands have the highest rate of adoption in the world, despite a relatively high fertility rate of 2.6 children.
faroese is spoken in the entire country as a first language. it is not possible to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the faroese language.
the 2011 census, called manntal, shows that 10% were not born in the faroe islands, but of these only 3% were born outside the kingdom of denmark. 6.5% of people older than 15 did not speak faroese as their mother tongue. 33 persons said that they did not understand faroese at all. according to the 2011 census, 45 361 faroese people (people living in the faroes) spoke faroese as their first language and 1546 spoke danish as their first language.
the faroese language is one of the smallest of the germanic languages. it is most similar to icelandic and norwegian. in the twentieth century faroese became the official language and since the faroes are a part of the danish realm danish is taught in schools as a compulsory second language.
faroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in faroese suitable for modern life.

the politics of the faroe islands a "constituent country" () of the kingdom of denmark, function within the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, whereby the prime minister of the faroe islands is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. the faroe islands are politically associated with the kingdom of denmark, but have been self-governing since 1948. executive power is exercised by the government. legislative power is vested in both the government and the løgting. the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and the responsibility of denmark. as of october 25, 2007, the faroe islands became one electoral district.
the high commissioner is appointed by the queen of denmark. the high commissioner has a seat in the løgting, he or she is allowed to speak in the løgting regarding common danish/faroese affairs, but he or she is not allowed to vote. following legislative elections, the leader of the party that wins the most seats is usually given the initiative to establish a new coalition by the faroese parliament, unless the current løgmaður ("prime minister" in english) is still in power. however, if he or she fails, the chairman of the parliament asks all chairmen of the parties elected to the parliament, and asks them to point to another chairman who they feel can rightly form a new coalition. the chairman with the most votes is then handed the initiative. after forming the coalition, the løgmaður leads the landsstýri. the landsstýri will often consist of around 7 members. the coalition parties divide the various ministries among themselves and after this, the parties elect their representative to these ministries. any other member of the cabinet is called a "landsstýrismaður" if the person is a man, or "landsstýriskvinna" if the person is a woman. the word "ráðharri" is also used for a member of the cabinet, i.e. "mentamálaráðharri" (minister of culture) or "heilsumálaráðharri" (minister of health).
following the faroese general election, 2015, a new government, consisting of three parties (social democratic party, republic, and progress) under prime minister aksel v. johannesen, is formed with the ministry of internal affairs re-established and a number of cabinet positions consolidated.
the faroese parliament ("løgtingið in faroese") has 33 mps (members of parliament), elected for a four-year term by proportional representation.
election of 2 seats to the danish parliament was last held on june 18, 2015: social democrats 1, republic 1.
the faroe islands have a multi-party system (disputing on independence and unionism as well as left and right), with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. the faroese parliament (løgting) has 33 seats. members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. for the løgting elections there were seven electoral districts, each one comprehending a"sýslur", while streymoy is divided in a northern and southern part (tórshavn region), but since 2008, the faroes constitute a single district.
the islands are administratively divided into 30 municipalities with about 120 cities and villages.
traditionally, there are also the 6 sýslur (norðoyar, eysturoy, streymoy, vágar, sandoy and suðuroy). "sýsla" means district and although it is only a police district today, it is still commonly understood as a geographical region. in earlier times, each sýsla had its own ting, the so-called "várting" (spring ting).
the nation continues to be intimately tied with the nordic countries of europe and the european union.
along with diplomatic missions to iceland, the court of st. james's (united kingdom), russia and the european union, the faroe islands participate in the nordic council, nib, international maritime organization, international whaling commission (complete list of participation of the faroe islands in international organisations).

the economy of the faroe islands was the 166th largest in the world in 2014, having a nominal gross domestic product (gdp) of $2.613 billion per annum.
high dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. the faroese hope to broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants. petroleum found close to the faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity. also important are the annual subsidy from denmark, which amounts to about 3% of the gdp.
the faroes have one of the lowest unemployment rates in europe, but this is not necessarily a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to denmark and other countries once they are finished with high school. this leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to take it positions in business and industry.
after the severe economic troubles of the early 1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch and poor management of the economy, the faroe islands have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in mid-1998, and holding below 3% since 2006, one of the lowest rates in europe.
since 2000, new information technology and business projects have been fostered in the faroe islands to attract new investment. the result from these projects is not yet known but is hoped to bring a better market economy to the faroe islands.
in 2014 the faroe islands had a trade surplus of 401 million dkk, a figure that rose to 1.43 billion dkk in 2016. as of 2016, the faroe islands mainly imported goods from denmark (2,467 million dkk), germany (877 million dkk), and norway (610 dkk). the country's top export destinations were russia (1,907 million dkk), the united states (898 million dkk), the united kingdom (851 million dkk), and denmark (697 million dkk). european union countries constituted 72.9% of total faroese imports, while the exports of the faroes islands were more equally distributed between european union (44.4%) and non-european union countries (55.6%). the vast majority of faroese exports, almost 95%, consists of fishery products. russian countersanctions on food imports from norway and the european union, saw the faroe islands increase its fresh salmon exports to russia.
in 2014 217,547 tonnes of oil products were consumed in the faroe islands. of this 31.58% was consumed by fishing vessels, 14.73% was used by sev for electricity production, 23.23% was consumed in air, sea or land transport, 9.6 was used in the industry, and the rest was used in public or private buildings.
the islands have 6 hydroelectric plants, 4 diesel plants and several wind power plants with a capacity factor above 40%. in 2014, a 12mw wind farm for dkk 180 million became operational near torshavn and increased wind capacity from 6.6 to 18.6mw. it decreases oil consumption by 8,000 ton (approximately 4m€) per year. a 2.3mw 700 kwh lithium-ion battery became operational in 2016. planners also consider converting the existing hydropower to pumped-storage hydroelectricity. tidal power and thermal energy storage solutions are also considered. the islands have a goal of 100% green electricity production by 2030.
in 2014 and 2017 50.8% of the electricity production of sev in the faroe islands came from green energy like hydro and wind, while 49.2% was produced by the thermal power plants, which was 12.4% less than in 2013.
total annual production: 305.4 gwh (2014) of which the production of thermal, hydropower and wind power was:
the faroe islands have no electricity connections to other areas, and thus operate in island condition. some islands are also not connected to the other islands, and must maintain their own electric system.

the faroe islands is served by an internal transport system based on roads, ferries, and helicopters. as of the 1970s, the majority of the population centres of the faroe islands have been joined to a single road network, connected by bridges and tunnels.
international transport, both for passengers and freight, remains difficult due to high costs, long distances, and bad weather, especially during the winter. exporting domestically produced goods is thus expensive; this limits the development of a commodity-based economy.
the general history of the faroese transportation system can be divided into four periods:
during this first period, transportation was rather primitive; it consisted of row boats, walking, and, in certain places, horse transport (for the upper class).
the second period commenced in the late-19th century, when ferry connections began to emerge. the ferries were largely private initiatives, but they increasingly came to be operated by the public sector. this was supplemented by an emerging culture of automobiles. after world war ii, a large part of the faroe islands was accessible via ferries and automobiles; private buses and taxis operated as well.
the third period was characterized by modernization. the introduction of the car ferry made it possible to drive between the various city centres of the country. it became possible to drive from the capital tórshavn to vágur and tvøroyri in the south, to fuglafjørður and klaksvík in the north, and to the airport at sørvágur in the west. vágar airport was built by the british during world war ii; it was reopened as a civilian international airport in 1963. additionally, the road network was further developed. tunnels to distant valleys and firths such as hvalba, sandvík, and norðdepil were constructed in the 1960s.
the fourth period saw the emergence of a "mainland" thanks to tunnels and bridges. in 1973 the first bridge between two islands was established between norðskáli on eysturoy and nesvík on streymoy; in 1976 the new tunnel between norðskáli and eysturoy was completed. the faroes' two largest islands were connected into what is now referred to as "meginlandið", the mainland. in 1975 the causeway between viðoy and borðoy was constructed, in 1986 a similar one between borðoy and kunoy was established, and in 1992 the capital tórshavn was granted a first-class connection to the northern parts of the islands, creating the infrastructural prerequisites for a mobile society on the mainland.
the newest developments of the faroese transportation network are the sub-sea tunnels. in 2002 the tunnel between streymoy and vágar—the latter is the airport island—was finished, and in 2006 the norðoyatunnilin between eysturoy and borðoy was finished. a toll, payable at petrol stations, of 170 dkk (130 dkk in june 2013) is charged to drive through these two tunnels; the others are free. now more than 85% of the faroese population is accessible by automobile.
in early 2014 all political parties of the løgting agreed to the construction of two tunnels: "eysturoyartunnilin" a tunnel connecting eysturoy and streymoy will be completed by 2019 and "sandoyartunnilin", a tunnel connecting streymoy and sandoy, will be completed by 2021. the combined cost of the project is estimated at almost 2 billion dkk, and will be the most expensive construction project in faroese history. eysturoyartunnilin is intended to have a roundabout under the sea, and possibly an airport made from tunnel excavation. the three tubes will be 7,1 km, 2,1 km and 1,8 km long joined together by the roundabout. sandoyartunnilin will be 10,6 km long.
there have been talks about a possible tunnel between sandoy and suðuroy. the tunnel would be around 20–25 km long. if completed this would mean that 99% of the faroes would be connected by road.
there are no passenger railways on the faroe islands due to the difficult landscape, small population, and relatively short distances.
two railways have operated on the islands. a tunnel and rail system supplied a nato radar installation, now decommissioned, which previously existed on a mountaintop in the southern part of streymoy island. the gjógv incline railway operates a freight service between the harbour and the village of gjógv on eysturoy island.
roads have become the main method of transportation on the islands. google street view became available for some roads in november 2017, supplied by residents and sheep rather than google cars.
"total:"
there is an extensive bus network, with red and yellow "bussleiðin" town buses serving tórshavn and klaksvík respectively, and blue "bygdaleiðir" (which means "village route") buses connecting the rest of the islands. most buses are modern and were built by the volvo company.
the network of blue bygdaleiðir rural buses (as well as the ferries) is operated by strandfaraskip landsins on behalf of the faroese government, which provides subsidies. the principal route is tórshavn-klaksvík (via the new norðoyatunnilin tunnel), but other bus routes also serve most villages. although individual buses are generally owned by individuals or small companies, the timetables, fares, and levels of service are set by strandfaraskip landsins and the government.
bussleiðin is the name of the urban bus services, active in and around tórshavn in red colours and in and around klaksvík in yellow. tórshavn's bussleiðin has five routes and is operated by the tórshavn municipality. buses within tórshavn have been completely free of charge since 2007. this is a green initiative intended to persuade people to use public transportation rather than drive their cars. like bygdaleiðir, the actual buses are privately owned, but contracted to bussleiðin. klaksvík's service commenced in 2014.
"total:" 6 ships ( or over) totaling / (1999 est.)
the faroese ferry company strandfaraskip landsins operates a network of ferries, in addition to the rural blue buses, called bygdaleiðir (villagelines). their largest vessel is the smyril, a roll-on/roll-off ferry which maintains the link between tórshavn and the southern island, suðuroy. this vessel entered service in 2005. another ferry, teistin, a roll-on-off ferry maintains the link between the island sandoy and the main area, the ferry port on streymoy is near kirkjubøur and velbastaður on the south-west coast of streymoy. a sub-sea tunnel is planned between sandoy and streymoy, it will open in 2021 according to the plan. after that there will not be need of a ferry between the two islands.
since the early 1980s, smyril line has operated a regular international passenger, car and freight service using a large, modern, multipurpose ferry, the norröna. the weekly service links the faroe islands with seyðisfjörður, iceland and hirtshals, denmark.
scandinavian airlines and atlantic airways both provide regular scheduled flights to vágar airport. atlantic airways being the national airline of the faroe islands, operating airplanes, helicopters as well as performing search and rescue responsibilities from its base at vágar airport. helicopters provide domestic scheduled transportation and search and rescue activities. atlantic airways' airplanes have regular flights to iceland, denmark, norway and scotland while there are also seasonal flights connecting the faroe islands with destinations such as barcelona, mallorca and lisbon. apart from atlantic airways, scandinavian airlines has flights connecting the islands with copenhagen.
one: vágar airport. it has a paved 1,799 m / 5,902 ft runway. it was originally built by british royal engineers during the second world war.

fiji ( ; ; fiji hindi: फ़िजी), officially the republic of fiji (; fiji hindi: फ़िजी गणराज्य), is an island country in melanesia, part of oceania in the south pacific ocean about northeast of new zealand's north island. its closest neighbours are vanuatu to the west, new caledonia to the southwest, new zealand's kermadec islands to the southeast, tonga to the east, the samoas and france's wallis and futuna to the northeast, and tuvalu to the north. fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands—of which 110 are permanently inhabited—and more than 500 islets, amounting to a total land area of about . the most outlying island is ono-i-lau. the two major islands, viti levu and vanua levu, account for 87% of the total population of . the capital, suva, on viti levu, serves as the country's principal cruise-ship port. about three-quarters of fijians live on viti levu's coasts, either in suva or in smaller urban centres such as nadi—where tourism is the major local industry—or lautoka, where the sugar-cane industry is paramount. due to its terrain, the interior of viti levu is sparsely inhabited.
the majority of fiji's islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago. some geothermal activity still occurs today, on the islands of vanua levu and taveuni. the geothermal systems on viti levu are non-volcanic in origin, with low-temperature (c. 35–60 degrees celsius) surface discharges. sabeto hot springs near nadi is a good example. humans have lived in fiji since the second millennium bc—first austronesians and later melanesians, with some polynesian influences. europeans visited fiji from the 17th century onwards, and, after a brief period as an independent kingdom, the british established the colony of fiji in 1874. fiji operated as a crown colony until 1970, when it gained independence as the dominion of fiji. a military government declared a republic in 1987 following a series of coups d'état. in a coup in 2006, commodore frank bainimarama seized power. when the high court ruled the military leadership unlawful in 2009, president ratu josefa iloilo, whom the military had retained as the nominal head of state, formally abrogated the 1997 constitution and re-appointed bainimarama as interim prime minister. later in 2009, ratu epeli nailatikau succeeded iloilo as president. after years of delays, a democratic election took place on 17 september 2014. bainimarama's fijifirst party won 59.2% of the vote, and international observers deemed the election credible.
fiji has one of the most developed economies in the pacific thanks to its abundant forest, mineral, and fish resources. its currency is the fijian dollar, and its main sources of foreign exchange are its tourist industry, remittances from fijians working, and bottled water exports. the ministry of local government and urban development supervises fiji's local government, which takes the form of city and town councils.
fiji's main island is known as viti levu and it is from this that the name "fiji" is derived, though the common english pronunciation is based on that of their island neighbours in tonga. its emergence can be described as follows:
fijians first impressed themselves on european consciousness through the writings of the members of the expeditions of cook who met them in tonga. they were described as formidable warriors and ferocious cannibals, builders of the finest vessels in the pacific, but not great sailors. they inspired awe amongst the tongans, and all their manufactures, especially bark cloth and clubs, were highly valued and much in demand. they called their home viti, but the tongans called it fisi, and it was by this foreign pronunciation, fiji, first promulgated by captain james cook, that these islands are now known.
"feejee", the anglicised spelling of the tongan pronunciation, was used in accounts and other writings until the late 19th century, by missionaries and other travellers visiting fiji.
located in the central pacific ocean, fiji's geography has made it both a destination and a crossroads for migrations for many centuries. according to oral tradition, the indigenous fijians of today are descendants of the chief lutunasobasoba and those who arrived with him on the kaunitoni canoe. landing at what is now vuda, the settlers moved inland to the nakauvadra mountains. though this oral tradition has not been independently substantiated, the fijian government officially promotes it, and many tribes today claim to be descended from the children of lutunasobasoba.
pottery art from fijian towns shows that fiji was settled by austronesian peoples before or around 3500 to 1000 bc, with melanesians following around a thousand years later, although the question of pacific migration still lingers.
it is believed that the lapita people or the ancestors of the polynesians settled the islands first but not much is known of what became of them after the melanesians arrived; they may have had some influence on the new culture, and archaeological evidence shows that they would have then moved on to samoa, tonga and even hawai'i.
archeological evidence shows signs of settlement on moturiki island from 600 bc and possibly as far back as 900 bc.
aspects of fijian culture are similar to the melanesian culture of the western pacific but have a stronger connection to the older polynesian cultures. trade between fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before european contact is testified by the canoes made from native fijian trees found in tonga and tongan words being part of the language of the lau group of islands. pots made in fiji have been found in samoa and even the marquesas islands.
in the 10th century, the tu'i tonga empire was established in tonga, and fiji came within its sphere of influence. the tongan influence brought polynesian customs and language into fiji. the empire began to decline in the 13th century.
across from east to west, fiji has been a nation of many languages. fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility and over the centuries, a unique fijian culture developed. large elegant watercraft with rigged sails called "drua" were constructed in fiji, some being exported to tonga. distinctive village architecture evolved consisting of communal and individual "bure" and "vale" housing with an advanced system of rampants and moats usually being constructed around the more important settlements. pigs were domesticated for food and a variety of agricultural plantations such as bananas existed from an early stage. villages would also be supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts. fijians lived in societies that were led by chiefs, elders and notable warriors. spiritual leaders, often called "bete", were also important cultural figures and the production and consumption of "yaqona" was part of their ceremonial and community rites. fijians developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the sperm whale, called "tambua", became an active currency. a type of writing also existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands. they also produced a refined "masi" cloth textile industry with the material being used to make sails and clothes such as the "malo" and the "liku". as with most other human civilisations, warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial fiji the fijians were noted for their use of weapons especially war-clubs. fijians use many different types of clubs that can be broadly divided into two groups. the two main types of clubs they used were two handed clubs and small specialised throwing clubs called ula.
with the arrival of europeans and colonialism in the late 1700s, many elements of fijian culture were either repressed or modified to ensure european, namely british, control. this was especially the case concerning traditional fijian spiritual beliefs. early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of cannibalism in fiji to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion. by labelling native fijian customs as "debased and primitive", they were able to promote a narrative that fiji was a "paradise wasted on savage cannibals". extravagant stories made during the 19th century, such as that regarding ratu udre udre who is said to have consumed 872 people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement, permitted an enduring racial typecast of the "uncivilised" fijian. cannibalism, as an impression, was an effective racial tool deployed by the colonists that has endured through the 1900s and into the modern day. authors such as deryck scarr, for example, have perpetuated 19th century claims of "freshly killed corpses piled up for eating" and ceremonial mass human sacrifice on the construction of new houses and boats. although fiji was known as the "cannibal isles", other more recent research doubts even the existence of cannibalism in fiji. this view is not without criticism, and perhaps the most accurate account of cannibalism in 19th century fiji may come from william macgregor, the long term chief medical officer in british colonial fiji. during the little war of 1876, he stated that the rare occasion of tasting of the flesh of the enemy was done "to indicate supreme hatred and not out of relish for a gastronomic treat".
recent archaeological research conducted on fijian sites has begun to shed light on the accuracy of some of these european accounts of cannibalism. studies conducted by scholars including degusta, cochrane, and jones provide evidence that cannibalism has been practiced in fiji through skeletal modifications such as those due to burning or cutting. in the jones 2015 study, isotopic analysis of bone collagen provided evidence that human flesh had been consumed by fijians, although it was likely a small and not necessarily regular part of the diet. however, these archaeological accounts indicate that cannibalistic practices were likely more varied and less ubiquitous than european settlers originally described. exocannibalism, or cannibalism of members of outsider tribes, and cannibalism practiced as a means of violence or revenge probably play a significantly smaller role than european accounts suggested, with nonviolent and ritualistic practices being more likely.
dutch explorer abel tasman was the first known european visitor to fiji, sighting the northern island of vanua levu and the north taveuni archipelago in 1643 while looking for the great southern continent.
james cook, the british navigator, visited one of the southern lau islands in 1774. it was not until 1789, however, that the islands were charted and plotted, when william bligh, the castaway captain of , passed ovalau and sailed between the main islands of viti levu and vanua levu en route to batavia, in what is now indonesia. bligh water, the strait between the two main islands, is named after him, and for a time, the fiji islands were known as the "bligh islands."
the first europeans to maintain substantial contact with the fijians were sandalwood merchants, whalers and "beche-de-mer" (sea cucumber) traders. the first whaling vessel known to have visited was the ann and hope in 1799 and she was followed by many others in the 19th century. these ships came for drinking water, food and firewood and, later, for men to help man their ships. some of the europeans who came to fiji in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents. probably the most famous of these was a swede by the name of kalle svenson, better known as charlie savage. charlie was permitted to take wives and establish himself in a high rank in bau society in exchange for helping defeat local adversaries. in 1813, however, charlie became a victim of this lifestyle and was killed in a botched raid.
by the 1820s, levuka was established as the first european-style town in fiji, on the island of ovalau. the market for "beche-de-mer" in china was lucrative and british and american merchants set up processing stations on various islands. local fijians were utilised to collect, prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to asia. a good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25,000 for the dealer. the fijian workers were often given firearms and ammunition as an exchange for their labour, and by the end of the 1820s most of the fijian chiefs had muskets and many were skilled at using them. some fijian chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the europeans. in 1834, men from viwa and bau were able to take control of the french ship "l'amiable josephine" and use its cannon against their enemies on the rewa river, although they later ran it aground.
christian missionaries like david cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as tonga and tahiti, and by 1840 the european settlement at levuka had grown to about 40 houses with former whaler, david whippey, being a notable resident. the religious conversion of the fijians was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by captain charles wilkes of the united states exploring expedition. wilkes wrote that "all the chiefs seemed to look upon christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain". christianised fijians, in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs, were pressured into cutting their hair short, adopting the sulu form of dress from tonga and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions. this process of enforced cultural change was called "lotu". intensification of conflict between the cultures increased and wilkes was also involved in organising a large punitive expedition against the people of malolo. he ordered an attack with rockets which acted as makeshift incendiary devices. the village, with the occupants trapped inside, quickly became an inferno with wilkes himself noting that the "shouts of men were intermingled with the cries and shrieks of the women and children" as they burnt to death. wilkes demanded the survivors should "sue for mercy" and if not "they must expect to be exterminated". around 57 to 87 maloloan people were killed in this encounter.
the 1840s was a time of conflict where various fiji clans attempted to assert dominance over each other. eventually, a warlord by the name of seru epenisa cakobau of bau island was able to become a powerful influence in the region. his father was ratu tanoa visawaqa, the vunivalu (a chiefly title meaning "warlord," often translated also as "paramount chief") who had previously defeated the much larger burebasaga confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western fiji. cakobau, following on from his father, became so dominant that he was able to expel the europeans from levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies. in the early 1850s, cakobau went one step further and decided to declare war on all christians. his plans were thwarted after the missionaries in fiji received support from the already converted tongans and the presence of a british warship. the tongan prince enele ma'afu, a christian, had established himself on the island of lakeba in the lau archipelago in 1848, forcibly converting the local people to the methodist church. cakobau and other chiefs in the west of fiji regarded ma'afu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand tonga's dominion. cakobau's influence, however, began to wane and his heavy imposition of taxes on other fijian chiefs, who saw him at best as first among equals, caused them to defect from him.
around this time the united states also became interested in asserting their power in the region and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the fiji islands, john brown williams. in 1849, williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a fourth of july celebration, and in 1853 the european settlement of levuka was burnt to the ground. williams blamed cakobau for both these incidents and the us representative wanted cakobau's capital at bau destroyed in retaliation. a naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their christian allies. finally, on april 30, 1854, cakobau offered his "soro" (supplication) and yielded to these forces. he underwent the "lotu" and converted to christianity. the traditional fijian temples in bau were destroyed and the sacred "nokonoko" trees were cut down. cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the tongans, backed by the americans and british, to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert. these chiefs were soon defeated with qaraniqio of the rewa being poisoned and ratu mara of kaba being hanged in 1855. after these wars, most regions of fiji, except for the interior highland areas, had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of western interest. cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of the fijian people and was allowed to take the ironic title of "tui viti" ("king of fiji"), but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers.
the rising price of cotton in the wake of the american civil war (1861–1865) saw a flood of hundreds of settlers come to fiji in the 1860s from australia and the united states in order to obtain land and grow cotton. since there was still a lack of functioning government in fiji, these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with fijians who may or may not have been the true owners. although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes. in 1865, the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in fiji to establish some sort of government. this was initially successful and cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy.
with the demand for land high, the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of viti levu, the largest island in the archipelago. this put them into direct confrontation with the kai colo, which was a general term to describe the various fijian clans resident to these inland districts. the kai colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle, they were not christianised and they were not under the rule of cakobau or the confederacy. in 1867, a travelling missionary named thomas baker was killed by kai colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the sigatoka river. the acting british consul, john bates thurston, demanded that cakobau lead a force of fijians from coastal areas to suppress the kai colo. cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with 61 of his fighters being killed. settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern kai colo people called the wainimala. john bates thurston called in the australia station section of the royal navy for assistance. the navy duly sent commander rowley lambert and to conduct a punitive mission against the wainimala. an armed force of 87 men shelled and burnt the village of deoka and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over forty wainimala.
after the collapse of the confederacy, ma'afu established a stable administration in the lau islands and the tongans, therefore, were again becoming influential. other foreign powers such as the united states were also considering the possibility of annexing fiji. this situation was not appealing to many settlers, almost all of whom were british subjects from australia. britain, however, still refused to annex the country and subsequently a compromise was needed.
in june 1871, george austin woods, an ex-lieutenant of the royal navy, managed to influence cakobau and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration. cakobau was declared the monarch ("tui viti") and the kingdom of fiji was established. most fijian chiefs agreed to participate and even ma'afu chose to recognise cakobau and participate in the constitutional monarchy. however, many of the settlers had come from british colonies like victoria and new south wales where negotiation with the indigenous people almost universally involved the barrel of a gun. as a result, several aggressive, racially motivated opposition groups, such as the british subjects mutual protection society, sprouted up. one group called themselves the ku klux klan in a homage to the white supremacist group in america. however, when respected individuals such as charles st julian, robert sherson swanston and john bates thurston were appointed by cakobau, a degree of authority was established.
with the rapid increase in white settlers into the country, the desire for land acquisition also intensified. once again, conflict with the kai colo in the interior of viti levu ensued. in 1871, the killing of two settlers named spiers and mackintosh near the ba river (fiji) in the north-west of the island prompted a large punitive expedition of white farmers, imported slave labourers and coastal fijians to be organised. this group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the us civil war, had a battle with the kai colo near the village of cubu in which both sides had to withdraw. the village was destroyed and the kai colo, despite being armed with muskets, received numerous casualties. the kai colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and christian fijians throughout the district of ba. likewise, in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the rewa river, villages were burnt and a "great many" kai colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the rewa rifles.
although the cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands, it did want the kai colo subjugated and their land sold off. the solution was to form an army. robert s. swanston, the minister for native affairs in the kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was invariably called the king's troops or the native regiment. in a similar system to the native police that was present in the colonies of australia, two white settlers, james harding and w. fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade. the formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of fijians to protect their interests.
the situation intensified further in early 1873 when the burns family were killed by a kai colo raid in the ba river area. the cakobau government deployed 50 king's troopers to the region under the command of major fitzgerald to restore order. the local whites, with their own large force under the leadership of mr white and mr de courcy ireland, refused their posting and a further deployment of another 50 troops under captain harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. to prove the worth of the native regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 kai colo people at na korowaiwai. upon returning to the coast, the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. a skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of captain william cox chapman of who promptly detained mr white and mr de courcy ireland, forcing the group to disband. the authority of the king's troops and the cakobau government to crush the kai colo was now total.
from march to october 1873, a force of about 200 king's troops under the general administration of r.s. swanston with around 1000 coastal fijian and white volunteer auxiliaries, led a campaign throughout the highlands of viti levu to annihilate the kai colo. major fitzgerald and major h.c. thurston (the brother of john bates thurston) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. the combined forces of the different clans of the kai colo made a stand at the village of na culi. the kai colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. many kai colo were killed and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, ratu dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast. in the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of nibutautau. major h.c. thurston crushed this resistance in the two months following the battle at na culi. villages were burnt, kai colo were killed and a further large number of prisoners were taken. the operations were now over. about 1000 of the prisoners (men, women and children) were sent to levuka where some were hanged, the rest being sold into slavery and forced to work on various plantations throughout the islands.
the blackbirding era began in fiji in 1865 when the first new hebridean and solomon island labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations. the american civil war had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the union blockaded southern ports. cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. thousands of european planters flocked to fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. they sought labour from the melanesian islands. on 5 july 1865 ben pease received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the new hebrides to fiji.
the british and queensland governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. most melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. the living and working conditions for them in fiji were worse than those suffered by the later indian indentured labourers. in 1875, the chief medical officer in fiji, sir william macgregor, listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. after the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the fiji waters. the british sent warships to enforce the law (pacific islanders' protection act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.
a notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the brig "carl", organised by dr james patrick murray, to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of fiji. murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church missionaries. when islanders were enticed to a religious service, murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats. during the voyage murray shot about 60 islanders. he was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members. the captain of the "carl", joseph armstrong, was later sentenced to death.
in addition to the blackbirded labour from other pacific islands, thousands of people indigenous to the fijian archipelago were also sold into slavery on the plantations. as the white settler backed cakobau government, and later the british colonial government, subjugated areas in fiji under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. this not only provided a source of revenue for the government, but also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. the land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold off for additional revenue. an example of this is the lovoni people of ovalau island, who after being defeated in a war with the cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold off to the settlers at ₤6 per head. two thousand lovoni men, women and children were sold and their period of slavery lasted five years. likewise, after the kai colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of viti levu were sent to levuka and sold into slavery. warnings from the royal navy stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement and the british consul in fiji, edward bernard marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.
despite achieving military victories over the kai colo, the cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. indigenous fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes and the cotton price had collapsed. with these major issues in mind, john bates thurston approached the british government, at cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands. the newly elected tory british government under benjamin disraeli encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing fiji than it had been previously. the murder of bishop john coleridge patteson of the melanesian mission at nukapu in the reef islands had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 fijians on board the brig "carl." two british commissioners were sent to fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation. the question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between cakobau and his old rival, ma'afu, with both men vacillating for many months. on 21 march 1874, cakobau made a final offer, which the british accepted. on 23 september, sir hercules robinson, soon to be appointed the british governor of fiji, arrived on hms "dido" and received cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. after some vacillation, cakobau agreed to renounce his "tui viti" title, retaining the title of "vunivalu", or protector. the formal cession took place on 10 october 1874, when cakobau, ma'afu, and some of the senior chiefs of fiji signed two copies of the deed of cession. thus the colony of fiji was founded; 96 years of british rule followed.
to celebrate the annexation of fiji, hercules robinson, who was governor of new south wales at the time, took cakobau and his two sons to sydney. there was a measles outbreak in that city and the three fijians all came down with the disease. on returning to fiji, the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship that the convalescents travelled in. this was despite the british having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population. in 1875–76, an epidemic of measles resultant of this decision killed over 40,000 fijians, about one-third of the fijian population. some fijians who survived were of the opinion that this failure of quarantine was a deliberate action to introduce the disease into the country. whether this is the case or not, the decision, which was one of the first acts of british control in fiji, was at the very least grossly negligent.
sir hercules robinson was replaced as governor of fiji in june 1875 by sir arthur hamilton gordon. gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the qalimari and kai colo people. in early 1875, colonial administrator edgar leopold layard, had met with thousands of highland clans at navuso in viti levu to formalise their subjugation to british rule and the christian religion. layard and his delegation managed to spread the measles epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. as a result, anger at the british colonists flared throughout the region and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. villages along the sigatoka river and in the highlands above this area refused british control and gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.
in what gordon himself termed the "little war", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of viti levu. the first was conducted by gordon's second cousin, arthur john lewis gordon, against the qalimari insurgents along the sigatoka river. the second campaign was led by louis knollys against the kai colo in the mountains to the north of the river. governor gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where a.j.l. gordon and knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation. the two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by walter carew and george le hunte who were stationed at nasaucoko. carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the wainimala people of the eastern highlands. the war involved the use of the soldiers of the old native regiment of cakobau supported by around 1500 christian fijian volunteers from other areas of viti levu. the colonial government of new zealand provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including one hundred snider rifles.
the campaign along the sigatoka river was conducted under a scorched earth policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked. after the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of koroivatuma, bukutia and matanavatu, the qalimari surrendered "en masse". those who weren't killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of cuvu. this included 827 men, women and children as well as the leader of the insurgents, a man named mudu. the women and children were distributed to places like nadi and nadroga. of the men, 15 were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at sigatoka. governor gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, a.j.l. gordon. four were hanged and ten, including mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. by the end of proceedings the governor noted that "my feet were literally stained with the blood that i had shed".
the northern campaign against the kai colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. knollys managed to clear the caves "after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition". the occupants of these caves included whole communities and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. the rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. the chief medical officer in british fiji, william macgregor, also took part both in killing kai colo and tending to their wounded. after the caves were taken, the kai colo surrendered and their leader, bisiki, was captured. various trials were held, mostly at nasaucoko under le hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.
by the end of october 1876, the "little war" was over and gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of viti levu. those insurgents who weren't killed or executed were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. gordon also constructed a military fortress, fort canarvon, at the headwaters of the sigatoka river where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain british control. he renamed the native regiment, the armed native constabulary to lessen its appearance of being a military force.
in order to further consolidate social control throughout the colony, governor gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace. gordon adopted the chiefly titles "roko" and "buli" to describe these deputies and established a great council of chiefs which was directly subject to his authority as supreme chief. this body remained in existence until being suspended by the military-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.
gordon also extinguished the ability of fijians to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.
gordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from india to work on the sugarcane fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations. the 463 indians arrived on 14 may 1879 – the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916. the plan involved bringing the indian workers to fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to india at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to india at the government's expense, or remaining in fiji. the great majority chose to stay. the queensland act, which regulated indentured labour in queensland, was made law in fiji also.
between 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of indians moved to fiji to work as indentured labourers, especially on sugarcane plantations. a total of 42 ships made 87 voyages, carrying indian indentured labourers to fiji. initially the ships brought labourers from calcutta, but from 1903 all ships except two also brought labourers from madras and bombay. a total of 60,965 passengers left india but only 60,553 (including births at sea) arrived in fiji. a total of 45,439 boarded ships in calcutta and 15,114 in madras. sailing ships took, on average, seventy-three days for the trip while steamers took 30 days. the shipping companies associated with the labour trade were nourse line and british-india steam navigation company.
repatriation of indentured indians from fiji began on 3 may 1892, when the "british peer" brought 464 repatriated indians to calcutta. various ships made similar journeys to calcutta and madras, concluding with "sirsa"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 1951 voyage. in 1955 and 1956, three ships brought indian labourers from fiji to sydney, from where the labourers flew to bombay.
indentured indians wishing to return to india were given two options. one was travel at their own expense and the other free of charge but subject to certain conditions. to obtain free passage back to india, labourers had to have been above age twelve upon arrival, completed at least five years of service and lived in fiji for a total of ten consecutive years. a child born to these labourers in fiji could accompany his or her parents or guardian back to india if he or she was under twelve.
due to the high cost of returning at their own expense, most indentured immigrants returning to india left fiji around ten to twelve years after arrival. indeed, just over twelve years passed between the voyage of the first ship carrying indentured indians to fiji (the "leonidas", in 1879) and the first ship to take indians back (the "british peer", in 1892).
given the steady influx of ships carrying indentured indians to fiji up until 1916, repatriated indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. the total number of repatriates under the fiji indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. because the return figure includes children born in fiji, many of the indentured indians never returned to india.
direct return voyages by ship ceased after 1951. instead, arrangements were made for flights from sydney to bombay, the first of which departed in july 1955. labourers still travelled to sydney by ship.
with almost all aspects of indigenous fijian social life being controlled by british authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. these movements were called tuka, which roughly translates as "those who stand up". the first tuka movement, was led by ndoongumoy, better known as navosavakandua which means "he who speaks only once". he told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as degei and rokola, their current condition would be transformed with the whites and their puppet fijian chiefs being subservient to them. navosavakandua was previously exiled from the viti levu highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace and the british quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. he was again exiled, this time to rotuma where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.
other tuka organisations, however, soon appeared. the british were ruthless in their suppression of both the leaders and followers with figureheads such as sailose being banished to an asylum for 12 years. in 1891, entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the tuka ideology were deported as punishment. three years later in the highlands of vanua levu, where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion, the governor of fiji, john bates thurston, ordered in the armed native constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics. leaders were jailed and villagers exiled or forced to amalgamate into government-run communities. later, in 1914, apolosi nawai came to the forefront of fijian tuka resistance by founding a co-operative company that would legally monopolise the agricultural sector and boycott european planters. the company was called the viti kabani and it was a hugely successful. the british and their proxy council of chiefs were not able to prevent the viti kabani's rise and again the colonists were forced to send in the armed native constabulary. apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915 and the company collapsed in 1917. over the next 30 years, apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the british viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.
fiji was only peripherally involved in world war i. one memorable incident occurred in september 1917 when count felix von luckner arrived at wakaya island, off the eastern coast of viti levu, after his raider, , had run aground in the cook islands following the shelling of papeete in the french territory of tahiti. on 21 september, the district police inspector took a number of fijians to wakaya, and von luckner, not realizing that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.
citing unwillingness to exploit the fijian people, the colonial authorities did not permit fijians to enlist. one fijian of chiefly rank, a greatgrandson of cakobau's, did join the french foreign legion, however, and received france's highest military decoration, the croix de guerre. after going on to complete a law degree at oxford university, this same chief returned to fiji in 1921 as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate. in the years that followed, ratu sir lala sukuna, as he was later known, established himself as the most powerful chief in fiji and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern fijian nation.
by the time of world war ii, the united kingdom had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives, and many thousands of fijians volunteered for the fiji infantry regiment, which was under the command of ratu sir edward cakobau, another greatgrandson of seru epenisa cakobau. the regiment was attached to new zealand and australian army units during the war.
because of its central location, fiji was selected as a training base for the allies. an airstrip was built at nadi (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast. fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the solomon islands campaign, with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as "death with velvet gloves". corporal sefanaia sukanaivalu, of yucata, was posthumously awarded the victoria cross, as a result of his bravery in the battle of bougainville.
a constitutional conference was held in london in july 1965, to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government. indo-fijians, led by a. d. patel, demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll. these demands were vigorously rejected by the ethnic fijian delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an indo-fijian dominated government come to power. the british made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring fiji to self-government and eventual independence. realizing that they had no choice, fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.
a series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with ratu kamisese mara as the first chief minister. ongoing negotiations between mara and sidiq koya, who had taken over the leadership of the mainly indo-fijian national federation party on patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in london, in april 1970, at which fiji's legislative council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation within the commonwealth. the legislative council would be replaced with a bicameral parliament, with a senate dominated by fijian chiefs and a popularly elected house of representatives. in the 52-member house, native fijians and indo-fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent "communal constituencies" comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing "national constituencies" to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage. a further 8 seats were reserved for "general electors" – europeans, chinese, banaban islanders, and other minorities; 3 of these were "communal" and 5 "national". with this compromise, fiji became independent on 10 october 1970.
the british granted fiji independence in 1970. democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the indo-fijian (indian) community. the second 1987 coup saw both the fijian monarchy and the governor general replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from "dominion of fiji" to "republic of fiji" and then in 1997 to "republic of the fiji islands". the two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy indo-fijian emigration; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that melanesians became the majority.
in 1990, the new constitution institutionalised ethnic fijian domination of the political system. the group against racial discrimination (gard) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. in 1992 sitiveni rabuka, the lieutenant colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became prime minister following elections held under the new constitution. three years later, rabuka established the constitutional review commission, which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous fijian and indo-fijian communities. fiji was re-admitted to the commonwealth of nations.
the year 2000 brought along another coup, instigated by george speight, which effectively toppled the government of mahendra chaudhry, who in 1997 had become the country's first indo-fijian prime minister following the adoption of the new constitution. commodore frank bainimarama assumed executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of president ratu sir kamisese mara. later in 2000, fiji was rocked by two mutinies when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at suva's queen elizabeth barracks. the high court ordered the reinstatement of the constitution, and in september 2001, to restore democracy, a general election was held which was won by interim prime minister laisenia qarase's soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua party.
in 2005, the qarase government amid much controversy proposed a reconciliation and unity commission with power to recommend compensation for victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty for its perpetrators. however, the military, especially the nation's top military commander, frank bainimarama, strongly opposed this bill. bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham. his attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout may and into june and july, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.
in late november and early december 2006, bainimarama was instrumental in the 2006 fijian coup d'état. bainimarama handed down a list of demands to qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament, part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the 2000 coup attempt. he gave qarase an ultimatum date of 4 december to accede to these demands or to resign from his post. qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign, and on 5 december the president, ratu josefa iloilo, was said to have signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with bainimarama.
in april 2009, the fiji court of appeal ruled that the 2006 coup had been illegal. this began the 2009 fijian constitutional crisis. president iloilo abrogated the constitution, removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the central bank. he then reappointed bainimarama under his "new order" as interim prime minister and imposed a "public emergency regulation" limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship.
for a country of its size, fiji has fairly large armed forces, and has been a major contributor to un peacekeeping missions in various parts of the world. in addition, a significant number of former military personnel have served in the lucrative security sector in iraq following the 2003 us-led invasion.
fiji covers a total area of some of which around 10% is land.
fiji is the hub of the south west pacific, midway between vanuatu and tonga. the archipelago is located between 176° 53′ east and 178° 12′ west. the 180° meridian runs through taveuni but the international date line is bent to give uniform time (utc+12) to all of the fiji group. with the exception of rotuma, the fiji group lies between 15° 42′ and 20° 02′ south. rotuma is located north of the group, from suva, 12° 30′ south of the equator.
fiji consists of 332 islands (of which 106 are inhabited) and 522 smaller islets. the two most important islands are viti levu and vanua levu, which account for about three-quarters of the total land area of the country. the islands are mountainous, with peaks up to 1,324 metres (4,341 ft), and covered with thick tropical forests.
the highest point is mount tomanivi on viti levu. viti levu hosts the capital city of suva, and is home to nearly three-quarters of the population. other important towns include nadi (the location of the international airport), and lautoka, fiji's second city with large sugar cane mills and a seaport.
the main towns on vanua levu are labasa and savusavu. other islands and island groups include taveuni and kadavu (the third and fourth largest islands, respectively), the mamanuca group (just off nadi) and yasawa group, which are popular tourist destinations, the lomaiviti group, off suva, and the remote lau group. rotuma, some north of the archipelago, has a special administrative status in fiji. ceva-i-ra, an uninhabited reef, is located about southwest of the main archipelago.
the climate in fiji is tropical marine and warm year round with minimal extremes. the warm season is from november to april and the cooler season lasts from may to october. temperatures in the cool season still average . rainfall is variable, with the warm season experiencing heavier rainfall, especially inland. for the larger islands, rainfall is heavier on the southeast portions of the islands than on the northwest portions, with consequences for agriculture in those areas. winds are moderate, though cyclones occur about once a year (10–12 times per decade).
on 20 february 2016, fiji was hit by the full force of cyclone winston, the only category 5 tropical cyclone to make landfall in the nation. winston destroyed tens of thousands of homes across the island, killing 44 people and causing an estimated fj$2 billion (us$1 billion) in damage.
politics in fiji normally take place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic wherein the prime minister of fiji is the head of government and the president the head of state, and of a multi-party system. executive power is exercised by the government, legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament of fiji, and the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
fiji is heavily engaged with or has membership in pacific regional development organizations. it has been a leading member of the pacific community since 1971 and hosts the largest spc presence of any pacific nation.
fiji is also home to many international organization regional offices including:
global environment facility (gef)
united nations children’s fund (unicef)
world health organization (who)
international labour organization (ilo)
united nations population fund (unfpa)
united nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women (un women)
joint united nations programme on hiv/aids (unaids)
office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights (ohchr)
united nations escap subregional office for the pacific (un-escap)
un office for the coordination of the humanitarian affairs in the pacific (unocha)
un international strategy for disaster reduction subregional office for the pacific (unisdr)
united nations department of safety and security (undss)

united nations capital development fund (uncdf)
united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc)
citing corruption in the government, commodore frank bainimarama, commander of the republic of fiji military forces, staged a military takeover on 5 december 2006 against the prime minister that he had installed after a 2000 coup. there had also been a military coup in 1987. the commodore took over the powers of the presidency and dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the military to continue the takeover. the coup was the culmination of weeks of speculation following conflict between the elected prime minister, laisenia qarase, and commodore bainimarama. bainimarama had repeatedly issued demands and deadlines to the prime minister. a particular issue was previously pending legislation to pardon those involved in the 2000 coup. bainimarama named jona senilagakali as caretaker prime minister. the next week bainimarama said he would ask the great council of chiefs to restore executive powers to the president, ratu josefa iloilo.
on 4 january 2007, the military announced that it was restoring executive power to president iloilo, who made a broadcast endorsing the actions of the military. the next day, iloilo named bainimarama as the interim prime minister, indicating that the military was still effectively in control. in the wake of the takeover, reports emerged of alleged intimidation of some of those critical of the interim regime.
on 9 april 2009, the court of appeal overturned the high court decision that cdre. bainimarama's takeover of qarase's government was lawful and declared the interim government to be illegal. bainimarama agreed to step down as interim pm immediately, along with his government, and president iloilo was to appoint "a distinguished person independent of the parties to this litigation as caretaker prime minister, ...to direct the issuance of writs for an election".
on 10 april 2009, president iloilo suspended the constitution of fiji, dismissed the court of appeal and, in his own words, "appoint[ed] [him]self as the head of the state of fiji under a new legal order". as president, iloilo had been head of state prior to his abrogation of the constitution, but that position had been determined by the constitution itself. the "new legal order" did not depend on the constitution, thus requiring a "reappointment" of the head of state. "you will agree with me that this is the best way forward for our beloved fiji", he said. bainimarama was re-appointed as interim prime minister; he, in turn, re-instated his previous cabinet.
on 2 may 2009, fiji became the first nation ever to have been suspended from participation in the pacific islands forum, for its failure to hold democratic elections by the date promised. nevertheless, it remains a member of the forum.
on 1 september 2009, fiji was suspended from the commonwealth of nations. the action was taken because cdre. bainimarama failed to hold elections by 2010 as the commonwealth of nations had demanded after the 2006 coup. cdre. bainimarama stated a need for more time to end a voting system that heavily favoured ethnic fijians at the expense of the multi-ethnic minorities. critics, however, claimed that he had suspended the constitution and was responsible for human rights violations by arresting and detaining opponents.
in his 2010 new year's address, cdre. bainimarama announced the lifting of the public emergency regulations (per). however, the per was not rescinded until january 8, 2012 and the suva philosophy club was the first organisation to reorganise and convene public meetings. the per had been put in place in april 2009 when the former constitution was abrogated. the per had allowed restrictions on speech, public gatherings, and censorship of news media and had given security forces added powers. he also announced a nationwide consultation process leading to a new constitution under which the 2014 elections were to be held.
on 14 march 2014, the commonwealth ministerial action group voted to change fiji's full suspension from the commonwealth of nations to a suspension from the councils of the commonwealth, allowing them to participate in a number of commonwealth activities, including the 2014 commonwealth games. the suspension was lifted in september 2014.
a general election took place on 17 september 2014. bainimarama's fijifirst party won with 59.2% of the vote, and the election was deemed credible by a group of international observers from australia, india and indonesia.
the military consists of the republic of fiji military forces (rfmf) with a total manpower of 3,500 active soldiers and 6,000 reservists, and includes a navy unit of 300 personnel.
the land force comprises the fiji infantry regiment (regular and territorial force organised into six light infantry battalions), fiji engineer regiment, logistic support unit and force training group. the two regular battalions are traditionally stationed overseas on peacekeeping duties.
the law enforcement branch is composed of:
fiji is divided into four major divisions which are further divided into 14 provinces. they are:
fiji was also divided into 3 confederacies or governments during the reign of seru epenisa cakobau, though these are not considered political divisions, they are still considered important in the social divisions of the indigenous fijians:
endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, fiji is one of the most developed of the pacific island economies, though still with a large subsistence sector. some progress was experienced by this sector when marion m. ganey, s.j., introduced credit unions to the islands in the 1950s. natural resources include timber, fish, gold, copper, offshore oil, and hydropower. fiji experienced a period of rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s but stagnated in the 1980s. the coup of 1987 caused further contraction.
economic liberalisation in the years following the coup created a boom in the garment industry and a steady growth rate despite growing uncertainty regarding land tenure in the sugar industry. the expiration of leases for sugar cane farmers (along with reduced farm and factory efficiency) has led to a decline in sugar production despite subsidies for sugar provided by the eu; fiji has been the second largest beneficiary of sugar subsidies after mauritius. fiji's vital gold mining industry based in vatukoula, which shut down in 2006, was reactivated in 2008.
urbanisation and expansion in the service sector have contributed to recent gdp growth. sugar exports and a rapidly growing tourist industry – with tourists numbering 430,800 in 2003 and increasing in the subsequent years – are the major sources of foreign exchange. fiji is highly dependent on tourism for revenue. sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity. long-term problems include low investment and uncertain property rights. the political turmoil in fiji in the 1980s, the 1990s, and 2000 had a severe impact on the economy, which shrank by 2.8% in 2000 and grew by only 1% in 2001.
the tourism sector recovered quickly, however, with visitor arrivals reaching pre-coup levels in 2002, resulting in a modest economic recovery which continued into 2003 and 2004 but grew by a mere 1.7% in 2005 and by 2.0% in 2006. although inflation is low, the policy indicator rate of the reserve bank of fiji was raised by 1% to 3.25% in february 2006 due to fears of excessive consumption financed by debt. lower interest rates have so far not produced greater investment in exports.
however, there has been a housing boom due to declining commercial mortgage rates. the tallest building in fiji is the fourteen-storey reserve bank of fiji building in suva, which was inaugurated in 1984. the suva central commercial centre, which opened in november 2005, was planned to outrank the reserve bank building at seventeen stories, but last-minute design changes ensured that the reserve bank building remained the tallest.
trade and investment with fiji have been criticised due to the country's military dictatorship. in 2008, fiji's interim prime minister and coup leader frank bainimarama announced election delays and said that fiji would pull out of the pacific islands forum in niue, where bainimarama was to have met with australian prime minister kevin rudd and new zealand prime minister helen clark.
the south pacific stock exchange (spse) is the only licensed securities exchange in fiji and is based in suva. its vision is to become a regional exchange.
fiji has a significant amount of tourism with the popular regions being nadi, the coral coast, denarau island, and mamanuca islands. the biggest sources of international visitors by country are australia, new zealand and the united states. fiji has a significant number of soft coral reefs, and scuba diving is a common tourist activity.
fiji's main attractions to tourists are primarily white sandy beaches and aesthetically pleasing islands with all-year-round tropical weather. in general, fiji is a mid-range priced holiday/vacation destination with most of the accommodations in this range. it also has a variety of world class five-star resorts and hotels. more budget resorts are being opened in remote areas, which will provide more tourism opportunities. cnn named fiji's laucala island resort as one of the fifteen world's most beautiful island hotels.
official statistics show that in 2012, 75% of visitors stated that they came for a holiday/vacation. honeymoons are very popular as are romantic getaways in general. there are also family friendly resorts with facilities for young children including kids' clubs and nanny options.
fiji has several popular tourism destinations. the botanical gardens of thursten in suva, sigatoka sand dunes, and colo-i-suva forest park are three options on the mainland (viti levu). a major attraction on the outer islands is scuba diving.
according to the fiji bureau of statistics, most visitors arriving to fiji on a short term basis are from the following countries or regions of residence:
fiji has also served as a location for various hollywood movies starting from the mr robinson crusoe in 1932 to the blue lagoon (1980) starring brooke shields and return to the blue lagoon (1991) with milla jovavich. other popular movies shot in fiji include cast away (2000) and (2004).
the nadi international airport is located north of central nadi and is the largest fijian hub. nausori international airport is about northeast of downtown suva and serves mostly domestic traffic with flights from australia and new zealand. the main airport in the second largest island of vanua levu is labasa airport located at waiqele, southwest of labasa town. the largest aircraft handled by labasa airport is the atr 72. airports fiji limited (afl) is responsible for the operation of 15 public airports in the fiji islands. these include two international airports: nadi international airport, fiji's main international gateway, and nausori airport, fiji's domestic hub, and 13 outer island airports. fiji's main airline was previously known as air pacific, but is now known as fiji airways.
fiji's larger islands have extensive bus routes that are affordable and consistent in service. there are bus stops, and in rural areas buses are often simply hailed as they approach. buses are the principal form of public transport and passenger movement between the towns on the main islands. buses also serve on roll-on-roll-off inter-island ferries. bus fares and routes are heavily regulated by the land transport authority (lta). bus and taxi drivers hold public service licenses (psvs) issued by the lta.
taxis are licensed by the lta and operate widely all over the country. apart from urban, town-based taxis, there are others that are licensed to serve rural or semi-rural areas. the flagfall for regular taxis is f$1.50 and tariff is f$0.10 for every 200 meters. for taxis that are allowed to charge value added tax (vat), the flagfall is f$1.50 and tariff is f$0.30 for the first 200 meters, and f$0.11 for every 200 meters thereafter. taxis operating out of fiji's international airport, nadi charge a flagfall of f$5. the elderly and government welfare recipients are given a 20% discount on their taxi fares.
inter-island ferries provide services between fiji's principal islands and large vessels operate roll-on-roll-off services, transporting vehicles and large amounts of cargo between the main island of viti levu and vanua levu, and other smaller islands.
fiji is the only developing pacific island country with recent data for gross domestic expenditure on research and development (gerd). the national bureau of statistics cites a gerd/gdp ratio of 0.15% in 2012. private-sector research and development (r&d) is negligible.
government investment in r&d tends to favour agriculture. in 2007, agriculture and primary production accounted for just under half of government expenditure on r&d, according to the fijian national bureau of statistics. this share had risen to almost 60% by 2012. however, scientists publish much more in the field of geosciences and health than in agriculture.
the rise in government spending on agricultural research has come to the detriment of research in education, which dropped to 35% of total research spending between 2007 and 2012. government expenditure on health research has remained fairly constant, at about 5% of total government research spending, according to the fijian national bureau of statistics.
the fijian ministry of health is seeking to develop endogenous research capacity through the "fiji journal of public health", which it launched in 2012. a new set of guidelines are now in place to help build endogenous capacity in health research through training and access to new technology.
fiji is also planning to diversify its energy sector through the use of science and technology. in 2015, the secretariat of the pacific community observed that, 'while fiji, papua new guinea and samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.
in 2014, the centre of renewable energy became operational at the university of fiji, with the assistance of the renewable energy in pacific island countries developing skills and capacity programme (epic) funded by the european union. since the programme's inception in 2013, epic has also developed a master's programme in renewable energy management for the university of fiji.
the 2017 census found that the population of fiji was 884,887, compared to the population of 837,271 in the 2007 census. the population density at the time of the 2007 census was 45.8 inhabitants per square kilometre. the life expectancy in fiji was 72.1 years. since the 1930s the population of fiji has increased at a rate of 1.1% per year. the population is dominated by the 15–64 age segment. the median age of the population was 27.9, and the gender ratio was 1.03 males per 1 female.
the population of fiji is mostly made up of native fijians, who are melanesians (54.3%), although many also have polynesian ancestry, and indo-fijians (38.1%), descendants of indian contract labourers brought to the islands by the british colonial powers in the 19th century. the percentage of the population of indo-fijian descent has declined significantly over the last two decades due to migration for various reasons. indo-fijians suffered reprisals for a period after the fiji coup of 2000. there is also a small but significant group of descendants of indentured labourers from the solomon islands.
about 1.2% are rotuman — natives of rotuma island, whose culture has more in common with countries such as tonga or samoa than with the rest of fiji. there are also small but economically significant groups of europeans, chinese, and other pacific island minorities.
the total membership of other ethnic groups of pacific islanders is about 7,300.
relationships between ethnic fijians and indo-fijians in the political arena have often been strained, and the tension between the two communities has dominated politics in the islands for the past generation. the level of political tension varies among different regions of the country.
the concept of family and community is of great importance to fijian culture. within the indigenous (itaukei) communities many members of the extended family will adopt particular titles and roles of direct guardians. kinship is determined through a child's lineage to a particular spiritual leader, so that a clan is based on traditional customary ties as opposed to actual biological links. these clans, based on the spiritual leader, are known as a matangali. within the matangali are a number of smaller collectives, known as the mbito. the descent is patrilineal, and all the status is derived from the father's side.
within fiji, many argue that the term "fijian" refers solely to indigenous fijians: it denotes an ancestral ethnicity, not a nationality. constitutionally, citizens of fiji were previously referred to as "fiji islanders" though the term "fiji nationals" was used for official purposes. however, the current constitution refers to all fijian citizens as "fijians". in august 2008, shortly before the proposed people's charter for change, peace and progress was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of fiji's citizens. if the proposal were adopted, all citizens of fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called "fijians". the proposal would change the english name of indigenous fijians from "fijians" to "itaukei", the fijian language endonym for indigenous fijians.
deposed prime minister laisenia qarase reacted by stating that the name "fijian" belonged exclusively to indigenous fijians, and that he would oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous fijians to use it. the methodist church, to which a large majority of indigenous fijians belong, also reacted strongly to the proposal, stating that allowing any fiji citizen to call themselves "fijian" would be "daylight robbery" inflicted on the indigenous population.
in an address to the nation during the constitutional crisis of april 2009, military leader and interim prime minister voreqe bainimarama, who has been at the forefront of the attempt to change the definition of "fijian", stated:
in may 2010, attorney-general aiyaz sayed-khaiyum reiterated that the term "fijian" should apply to all fiji nationals, but the statement was again met with protest. a spokesperson for the viti landowners and resource owners association claimed that even fourth-generation descendants of migrants did not fully understand "what it takes to be a fijian", and added that the term refers to a legal standing, since legislation affords specific rights to "fijians" (meaning, in legislation, indigenous fijians). fiji academic brij lal, although a prominent critic of the bainimarama government, said he "would not be surprised" if the new definition of the word "fijian" were included in the government's projected new constitution, and that he personally saw "no reason the term fijian should not apply to everyone from fiji".
fijian is an austronesian language of the malayo-polynesian family spoken in fiji. it has 350,000 first-language speakers, which is less than half the population of fiji, but another 200,000 speak it as a second language. the 1997 constitution established fijian as an official language of fiji, along with english and fiji hindi. fijian is a vos language.
the fiji islands developed many dialects, which may be classified in two major branches — eastern and western. missionaries in the 1840s chose an eastern dialect, the speech of bau island off the southeast coast of the main island of viti levu, to be the written standard of the fijian language. bau island was home to seru epenisa cakobau, the chief who eventually became the self-proclaimed king of fiji.
according to the 2007 census, 64.4% of the population at the time was christian, while 27.9% was hindu, 6.3% muslim, 0.8% non-religious, 0.3% sikh, and the remaining 0.3% belonged to other religions.
among christians, 54% were counted as methodist, followed by 14.2% catholic, 8.9% assemblies of god, 6.0% seventh-day adventist, 1.2% anglican with the remaining 16.1% belonging to other denominations.
the largest christian denomination is the methodist church of fiji and rotuma. with 34.6% of the population (including almost two-thirds of ethnic fijians), the proportion of the population adhering to methodism is higher in fiji than in any other nation. roman catholics in fiji are headed by the metropolitan archdiocese of suva, whose province also includes the dioceses of rarotonga (on the cook islands, for those and niue, both new zealand-associated countries) and tarawa and nauru (with see at tarawa on kiribati, also for nauru) and the mission sui iuris of tokelau (again with new zealand).
furthermore, the assemblies of god and the seventh-day adventists are significantly represented. fiji is the base for the anglican diocese of polynesia (part of the anglican church in aotearoa, new zealand and polynesia).these and other denominations have small numbers of indo-fijian members; christians of all kinds comprised 6.1% of the indo-fijian population in the 1996 census. hindus in fiji mostly belong to the sanatan sect (74.3% of all hindus) or else are unspecified (22%). muslims in fiji are mostly sunni (96.4%).
, primary and secondary school education in fiji is free; it is compulsory for eight years. as of 2001, attendance was decreasing due to security concerns and the burden of school fees, often due to the cost of transport. following the government coup in may 2000, more than 5,000 students were reported to have left school.
fiji's culture is a rich mosaic of indigenous fijian, indo-fijian, asian and european traditions, comprising social polity, language, food (coming mainly from the sea, plus casava, dalo (taro) and other vegetables), costume, belief systems, architecture, arts, craft, music, dance, and sports.
while indigenous fijian culture and traditions are very vibrant and are integral components of everyday life for the majority of fiji's population, fijian society has evolved over the past century with the introduction of traditions such as indian and chinese as well as significant influences from europe and fiji's pacific neighbours, particularly tonga and samoa. thus, the various cultures of fiji have come together to create a unique multicultural national identity.
fiji's culture was showcased at the world exposition held in vancouver, canada, in 1986 and more recently at the shanghai world expo 2010, along with other pacific countries in the pacific pavilion.
this is a list of holidays celebrated in fiji:
the exact dates of public holidays vary from year to year, but the dates for the next year can be found at the fiji government web site
the following holidays are no longer celebrated in fiji:
sports are very popular in fiji, particularly sports involving physical contact. fiji's national sport is rugby sevens.
rugby union is the most-popular team sport played in fiji.
the fiji national sevens side is a popular and successful international rugby sevens team, and has won the hong kong sevens a record eighteen times since its inception in 1976. fiji has also won the rugby world cup sevens twice — in 1997 and 2005. the fiji national rugby union sevens team is the reigning sevens world series champions in world rugby. in 2016, they won fiji's first ever olympic medal in the rugby sevens at the summer olympics, winning gold by defeating great britain 43-7 in the final.
the national rugby union team has competed at five rugby world cup competitions, the first being in 1987, where they reached the quarter-finals. the fiji national side did not match that feat again until the 2007 rugby world cup when they upset wales 38–34 to progress to the quarter-finals where they lost to the eventual rugby world cup winners, south africa. fiji also defeated the british and irish lions in 1977.
fiji competes in the pacific tri-nations and the irb pacific nations cup. the sport is governed by the fiji rugby union which is a member of the pacific islands rugby alliance, and contributes to the pacific islanders rugby union team. at the club level there are the skipper cup and farebrother trophy challenge.
the fiji national rugby union team is a member of the pacific islands rugby alliance (pira) formerly along with samoa and tonga. in 2009, samoa announced their departure from the pacific islands rugby alliance, leaving just fiji and tonga in the union. fiji is currently ranked eleventh in the world by the irb ().
fiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. there are about 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 900,000. one of the problems for fiji is simply getting their players to play for their home country, as many have contracts in europe with the french top 14 and the english aviva premiership or with super rugby teams, where monetary compensation is far more rewarding. the repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies. in addition, a significant number of players eligible to play for fiji end up representing australia or new zealand; notable examples are fiji-born cousins and former new zealand all blacks, joe rokocoko and sitiveni sivivatu, current all blacks waisake naholo and seta tamanivalu as well as australian wallabies former winger, lote tuqiri and current wallabies tevita kuridrani, samu kerevi and henry speight. fiji has won the most pacific tri-nations championships of the three participating teams.
the fiji national rugby league team, nicknamed the bati (pronounced [mˈbatʃi]), represents fiji in the sport of rugby league football and has been participating in international competition since 1992. it has competed in the rugby league world cup on three occasions, with their best results coming when they made consecutive semi-final appearances in the 2008 rugby league world cup and 2013 rugby league world cup. the team also competes in the pacific cup.
members of the team are selected from a domestic fijian competition, as well as from competitions held in new zealand and australia. for the 2000, 2008 and 2013 world cups, the bati were captained by lote tuqiri, wes naiqama and the legendary petero civoniceva respectively. fiji have also produced stars like akuila uate, jarryd hayne, kevin naiqama, semi tadulala, marika koroibete, apisai koroisau, sisa waqa and the sims brothers ashton sims, tariq sims and korbin sims.
the cibi (pronounced "thimbi") war dance was traditionally performed by the fiji rugby team before each match. it was replaced in 2012 with the new "bole" (pronounced "mbolay") war cry.
tradition holds that the original cibi was first performed on the rugby field back in 1939 during a tour of new zealand, when then fijian captain ratu sir george cakobau felt that his team should have something to match the haka of the all blacks. the 'cibi' had perhaps been used incorrectly though, as the word actually means "a celebration of victory by warriors," whereas 'bole' is the acceptance of a challenge.
the fiji bati rugby league team also gather in a huddle and perform the hymn 'noqu masu' before each match.
association football was traditionally a minor sport in fiji, popular largely amongst the indo-fijian community, but with international funding from fifa and sound local management over the past decade, the sport has grown in popularity in the wider fijian community. it is now the second most-popular sport in fiji, after rugby (union 15's and union 7's) for men, and after netball for women.
the fiji football association is a member of the oceania football confederation. the national football team defeated new zealand 2–0 in the 2008 ofc nations cup, on their way to a joint-record third-place finish. however, they have never reached a fifa world cup to date. fiji won the pacific games football tournament in 1991 and 2003. fiji qualified for the 2016 summer olympics men's tournament for the first time in history.
due to the success of fiji's national basketball teams, the popularity of basketball in fiji has experienced rapid growth in recent years. in the past, the country only had few basketball courts, which severely limited fijians who desired to practice the sport more frequently. due to recent efforts by the national federation "basketball fiji" and with the support of the australian government, many schools have been able to construct courts and provide their students with basketball equipment such as shoes, etc.
netball is the most popular women's participation sport in fiji. the national team has been internationally competitive, at netball world cup competitions reaching 6th position in 1999, its highest level to date. the team won gold medals at the 2007 and 2015 pacific games.
cricket is a minor sport in fiji. cricket fiji is an associate member of the international cricket council ("icc"). the fiji u19 team won the 2015 edition of the icc east asia-pacific tournament, and consequently qualified for the 2016 under-19 world cup. doing so made it the first u19 team other than papua new guinea u19 team to qualify from the region.

general information

the geography of finland is characterized by its northern position, its ubiquitous landscapes of intermingled boreal forests and lakes and its low population density. finland can be divided into three areas: archipelagoes and coastal lowlands, a slightly higher central lake plateau and uplands to north and northeast. bordering the baltic sea, gulf of bothnia, and gulf of finland, as well as sweden, norway, and russia, finland is the northernmost country in the european union. most of the population and agricultural resources are concentrated in the south. northern and eastern finland are sparsely populated containing vast wilderness areas. taiga forest is the dominant vegetation type.
finland's total area is . of this area 10% is water, 69% forest, 8% cultivated land and 13% other. finland is the eighth largest country in europe after russia, france, ukraine, spain, sweden, norway and germany.
as a whole, the shape of finland's boundaries resembles a figure of a one-armed human. in finnish, parallels are drawn between the figure and the national personification of finland – finnish maiden ("suomi-neito") – and the country as a whole can be referred in the finnish language by her name. even in official context the area around enontekiö in northwestern part of the country between sweden and norway can be referred to as the "arm" ("käsivarsi"). after the continuation war finland lost major land areas to russia in the moscow armistice of 1944, and the figure was said to have lost the other of her arms, as well as a hem of her "skirt".
the bedrock of finland belong to the baltic shield and was formed by a succession of orogenies in precambrian time. the oldest rocks of finland, those of archean age, are found in the east and north. these rocks are chiefly granitoids and migmatitic gneiss. rocks in central and western finland originated or came to place during the svecokarelian orogeny. following this last orogeny rapakivi granites intruded various locations of finland during the mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic, specially at åland and the southeast. so-called jotnian sediments occur usually together with rapakivi granites. the youngest rocks in finland are those found in the northwestern arm which belong to scandinavian caledonides that assembled in paleozoic times. during the caledonian orogeny finland was likely a sunken foreland basin covered by sediments, subsequent uplift and erosion would have eroded all of these sediments.
about one third of finland lies below 100 m, and about two thirds lies under 200 m. finland can be divided into three topographical areas; the coastal landscapes, the interior lake plateau also known as finnish lake district and upland finland. the coastal landscapes are made up mostly of plains below 20 m. these plains tilt gently towards the sea so that where its irregularities surpasses sea-level groups is islands like the kvarken archipelago or the åland islands are found. åland islands is connected to the finnish mainland by a shallow submarine plateau that does not exceed 20 m in depth. next to the gulf of bothnia the landscape of finland is extremely flat with height differences no larger than 50 m. this region called the ostrobothnian plain extends inland about 100 km and constitute the largest plain in the nordic countries.
the interior lake plateau is dominated by undulating hilly terrain with valley to top height differences of 100 or less and occasionally up to 200 m. only the area around the lakes pielinen and päijänne stand with a subtly more pronounced relief. the relief of the interior lake plateau bears some resemblance to the swedish norrland terrain. upland finland and areas higher than 200 m are found mostly in the north and east of the country. a limited number of hills and mountains exceed 500 m in height in these regions. inselberg plains are common in the northern half of the country. in the far north hills reach 200 to 400 m and the landscape is a förfjäll (fore-fell). only the extreme northwest contain a more dramatic mountain landscape.
the subdued landscape of finland is the result of protracted erosion that has leveled down ancient mountain massifs into near-flat landforms called peneplains. the last major leveling event resulted in the formation of the sub-cambrian peneplain in late neoproterozoic time. while finland has remained very close to sea-level since the formation of this last peneplain some further relief was formed by a slight uplift resulting in the carving of valleys by rivers. the slight uplift does also means that at parts the uplifted peneplain can be traced as summit accordances. the quaternary ice ages resulted in the erosion of weak rock and loose materials by glaciers. when the ice masses retreated eroded depressions turned into lakes. fractures in finland's bedrock were particularly affected by weathering and erosion, leaving as result trace straight sea and lake inlets.
except a few rivers along the coasts most rivers in finland drain at some stage into one or more lakes. the drainage basins drain into various directions. much of finland drain into the gulf of bothnia including the country's largest and longest rivers, kokemäenjoki and kemijoki respectively. finland's largest lake drain by vuoksi river into lake ladoga in russia. upland finland in the east drain east across russian republic of karelia into the white sea. in the northeast lake inari discharges by paatsjoki into barents sea in the arctic.
the ice sheet that covered finland intermittently during the quaternary grew out from the scandinavian mountains. during the last deglaciation the first parts of finland to became ice-free, the southeastern coast, did so slightly prior to the younger dryas cold-spell 12,700 years before present (bp). the retreat of the ice cover occurred simultaneously from the north-east, the east and southeast. the retreat was fastest from the southeast resulting in the lower course of tornio being the last part of finland to be deglaciated. finally by 10,100 years bp the ice cover had all but left finland to concentrate in sweden and norway before fading away.
as the ice sheet became thinner and retreated the land begun to rise by effect of isostacy. much of finland was under water when the ice retreated and was gradually uplifted in a process that continues today. albeit not all areas were drowned at the same time it is estimated at time or another about 62% has been under water. depending on location in finland the ancient shoreline reached different maximum heights. in southern finland 150 to 160 m, in central finland about 200 m and in eastern finland up to 220 m.
latitude is the principal influence on finland's climate. because of finland's northern location, winter is the longest season. only in the south coast is summer as long as winter. on the average, winter lasts from early december to mid march in the archipelago and the southwestern coast and from early october to early may in lapland. this means that southern portions of the country are snow-covered about three to four months of the year and the northern, about seven months. the long winter causes about half of the annual of precipitation in the north to fall as snow. precipitation in the south amounts to about annually. like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though not so much of it is snow.
the atlantic ocean to the west and the eurasian continent to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. the warm waters of the gulf stream and the north atlantic drift current, which warm norway and sweden, also warm finland. westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south. these winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. by contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.
the highest ever recorded temperature is (liperi, 29 july 2010). the lowest, (kittilä, 28 january 1999). the annual middle temperature is relatively high in the southwestern part of the country (), with quite mild winters and warm summers, and low in the northeastern part of lapland ().

this article is about the demographic features of the population of finland, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
finland numbers some 5.5 million people and has an average population density of 17 inhabitants per square kilometre. there has not been any remarkable growth in the number of population since the inception of modern finland. this makes it the third most sparsely populated country in europe, after iceland and norway. population distribution is very uneven: the population is concentrated on the small southwestern coastal plain. about 85% live in towns and cities, with one million living in the helsinki metropolitan area alone. in arctic lapland, on the other hand, there are only 2 people to every square kilometre.
finland is a relatively ethnically homogeneous country. the dominant ethnicity is the finnish people but there are also notable historic minorities of swedes, sami and roma people. as a result of recent immigration there are now also considerable groups of ethnic russians, estonians, iraqis and somalis in the country. 7.1% of the population is born abroad and 4.7% are foreign citizens. the official languages are finnish and swedish, the latter being the native language of about five per cent of the finnish population. from the 13th to the early 19th century finland was a part of sweden.
with 73 percent of finns in its congregation, the lutheran church is the largest religious group in the country.
the earliest inhabitants of most of the land area that makes up today's finland and scandinavia were in all likehood hunter-gatherers whose closest successors in modern terms would probably be the sami people (formerly known as the lapps). there are 4,500 of them living in finland today and they are recognised as a minority and speak three distinct languages: northern sami, inari sami and skolt sami. they have been living north of the arctic circle for more than 7,000 years now, but today are a 5% minority in their native lapland province. during the late 19th and 20th century there was significant emigration, particularly from rural areas to sweden and north america, while most immigrants into finland itself come from other european countries.
the geographical center of population (weber point) of the finnish population is currently located in hauho, in the village of sappee, now part of the town of hämeenlinna. the coordinates of this point are 61' 17" n, 25' 07" e.
the profound demographic and economic changes that occurred in finland after world war ii affected the finnish family. families became smaller, dropping from an average of 3.6 persons in 1950 to an average of 2.7 by 1975. family composition did not change much in that quarter of a century, however, and in 1975 the percentage of families that consisted of a man and a woman was 24.4; of a couple and children, 61.9; of a woman with offspring, 11.8; of a man and offspring, 1.9. these percentages are not markedly different from those of 1950. change was seen in the number of children per family, which fell from an average of 2.24 in 1950 to an average of 1.7 in the mid-1980s, and large families were rare. only 2 percent of families had four or more children, while 51 percent had one child; 38 percent, two children; and 9 percent, three children. the number of finns under the age of 18 dropped from 1.5 million in 1960 to 1.2 million in 1980.
the total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. it is based on fairly good data for the entire period. sources: our world in data and gapminder foundation.

attitudes toward marriage have changed substantially since world war ii. most obvious was the declining marriage rate, which dropped from 8.5 marriages per 1,000 finns in 1950 to 5.8, in 1984, a decline great enough to mean a drop also in absolute numbers. in 1950 there were 34,000 marriages, while in 1984 only 28,500 were registered, despite a growth in population of 800,000. an explanation for the decline was that there was an unprecedented number of unmarried couples. since the late 1960s, the practice of cohabitation had become increasingly common, so much so that by the late 1970s most marriages in urban areas grew out of what finns called "open unions." in the 1980s, it was estimated that about 8 percent of couples who lived together, approximately 200,000 people, did so without benefit of marriage. partners of such unions usually married because of the arrival of offspring or the acquisition of property. a result of the frequency of cohabitation was that marriages were postponed, and the average age for marriage, which had been falling, began to rise in the 1970s. by 1982 the average marriage age was 24.8 years for women and 26.8 years for men, several years higher for both sexes than had been true a decade earlier.
the overwhelming majority of finns did marry, however. about 90 percent of the women had been married by the age of forty, and spinsterhood was rare. a shortage of women in rural regions, however, meant that some farmers were forced into bachelorhood.
while the number of marriages was declining, divorce became more common, increasing 250 percent between 1950 and 1980. in 1952 there were 3,500 divorces. the 1960s saw a steady increase in this rate, which averaged about 5,000 divorces a year. a high of 10,191 was reached in 1979; afterwards the divorce rate stabilized at about 9,500 per year during the first half of the 1980s.
a number of factors caused the increased frequency of divorce. one was that an increasingly secularized society viewed marriage, more often than before, as an arrangement that could be ended if it did not satisfy its partners. another reason was that a gradually expanding welfare system could manage an ever-greater portion of the family's traditional tasks, and it made couples less dependent on the institution of marriage. government provisions for parental leave, child allowances, child care programs, and much improved health and pension plans meant that the family was no longer essential for the care of children and aged relatives. a further cause for weakened family and marital ties was seen in the unsettling effects of the great migration and in the economic transformation finland experienced during the 1960s and the 1970s. the rupture of established social patterns brought uncertainty and an increased potential for conflict into personal relationships.
recorded finland population figures date back to 1750 and have been faithfully updated ever since. they would clearly appear to have been rounded either up or down too and in 1750, it is shown that there were 421,000 people living here.
ten years later, those numbers had climbed to 490,000 – a rise of just over sixteen per cent and similar increases through the rest of the 1700’s took the population of finland to 837,000 at the start of the 19th century.
the population of finland climbed above one million for the first time by 1820 and as the 20th century began, figures within the country had increased to 2,655,900. this pattern of steady increases has continued ever since to the point where the finland population in 2012 is rapidly approaching 5.5 million.
it is reported that population growth slowed in finland after world war two with average family sizes falling from 3.6 in 1950 to 2.7 by 1975. therefore, while there is still growth here, it is considerably slower than it has been in the past.
finland is very ethnically homogeneous. most of the population is ethnic finnish. the earliest inhabitants of the area were hunter-gatherers, most closely related to the modern-day sami people of finland. there are about 4,500 sami left in finland who are officially recognized as a minority. the sami people have been living north of the arctic circle for over 7,000 years and account for a 5% minority in the lapland province. finland does not keep official statistics on ethnicity.
just 3.5% of the population is made up of foreign citizens, which is one of the lowest rates in the european union. most foreign citizens are from estonia, russia, and sweden. children of foreigners born in finland do not automatically receive finnish citizenship unless they cannot get citizenship in another nation.
demographic statistics according to the world population review in 2019.
demographic statistics according to the cia world factbook, unless otherwise indicated.
finn 93.4%, swede 5.6%, russian 0.5%, estonian 0.3%, romani 0.1%, sami 0.1% (2006)
finnish (official) 87.9%, swedish (official) 5.2%, russian 1.4%, other 5.5% (2017 est.)
lutheran 70.9%, finnish orthodox 1.1%, other 1.7%, unspecified 26.3% (2017 est.)
no official statistics are kept on ethnicities. however, statistics of the finnish population according to language, citizenship and country of birth are available. according to international census recommendations an ethnic group is defined by the perception of its members of historical and regional or national origin, and data or ethnic status should always be based on a person's own statement. because the census in finland is based on registries, finland can not produce official statistics about ethnic groups.
finnish and swedish are defined as languages of the state. swedish is an official municipal language in municipalities with significant swedish-speaking populations. the three sami languages (north sami, inari sami, skolt sami) are official in certain municipalities of lapland.
finnish people — finns — speak finnish, which is the dominant language and is spoken almost everywhere in the country except åland.
population of mainland finland (excluding åland) according to language, 1990-2015:
the government only considers the "working language", finnish or swedish, of the person, and "bilinguality" has no official standing.
the largest minority group in finland is the swedish-speaking finns, who in 2015 numbered about 290,000 or 5.3% of the total population. municipalities are classified as either unilingual or bilingual with a majority language. majority of swedish-speakers live in unilingual swedish-speaking or bilingual municipalities. these municipalities are found in coastal areas, from ostrobothnia to the southern coast, and in the archipelago of åland.
the sami are related to the finns, both speak non-indo-european languages belonging to the uralic family of languages. once present throughout the country, the sami gradually moved northward under the pressure of the advancing finns. as they were a nomadic people in a sparsely settled land, the sami were always able to find new and open territory in which to follow their traditional activities of hunting, fishing, and slash-and-burn agriculture. by the 16th century, most sami lived in the northern half of the country, and it was during this period that they converted to christianity. by the 19th century, most of them lived in the parts of lapland that were still their home in the 1980s. the last major shift in sami settlement was the migration westward of 600 skolt sami from the petsamo region after it was ceded to the soviet union in 1944. a reminder of their eastern origin was their orthodox faith; the remaining 85 percent of finland's sami were lutheran.
as of 1988, about 90 percent of finland's 4,400 sami lived in the municipalities of enontekiö, inari, and utsjoki, and in the reindeer herding-area of sodankylä. according to finnish regulations, anyone who spoke one of the sami languages, or who had a relative who was a sami, was registered as a sami in census records. finnish sami spoke three distinct sami languages, but by the late 1980s perhaps only a minority actually had sami as their first language. sami children had the right to instruction in sami, but there were few qualified instructors or textbooks available. one reason for the scarcity of written material in sami is that the three languages spoken in finland made agreement about a common orthography difficult. perhaps these shortcomings explained why a 1979 study found the educational level of sami to be considerably lower than that of other finns.
few finnish sami actually led the traditional nomadic life pictured in school geography texts and in travel brochures. although many sami living in rural regions of lapland earned some of their livelihood from reindeer herding, it was estimated that sami owned no more than one-third of finland's 200,000 reindeer. only 5 percent of finnish sami had the herds of 250 to 300 reindeer needed to live entirely from this kind of work. most sami worked at more routine activities, including farming, construction, and service industries such as tourism. often a variety of jobs and sources of income supported sami families, which were, on the average, twice the size of a typical finnish family. sami also were aided by old-age pensions and by government welfare, which provided a greater share of their income than it did for finns as a whole.
there have been many efforts over the years by finnish authorities to safeguard the sami' culture and way of life and to ease their entry into modern society. officials created bodies that dealt with the sami minority, or formed committees that studied their situation. an early body was the society for the promotion of lapp culture, formed in 1932. in 1960 the government created the advisory commission on lapp affairs. the sami themselves formed the saami-liitto in 1945 and the johti sabmelazzat, a more aggressive organization, in 1968. in 1973 the government arranged for elections every four years to a twenty-member sami parliaments that was to advise authorities. on the international level, there was the nordic sami council of 1956, and there has been a regularly occurring regional conference since then that represented—in addition to finland's sami—norway's 20,000 sami, sweden's 10,000 sami, and the 1,000 to 2,000 sami who remained in the kola peninsula in russia.
sami languages have an official status in the municipalities of enontekiö, inari, and utsjoki, and in the northern part of sodankylä since 1992. in 2009, 55% of the 9 350 sami in finland lived outside of this area.
russians in finland had come from two major waves. about 5,000 originate from a population that immigrated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when finland was a grand duchy of imperial russia. another consisted of those who immigrated after the dissolution of the soviet union. a significant catalyst was the right of return, based on president koivisto's initiative that people of ingrian ancestry would be allowed to immigrate to finland.
about 30,000 people have citizenship of the russian federation (2015) and russian is the mother language of about 70,000 people in finland, which represents about 1.3% of the population.
romani people, also called kale and roma, have been present in finland since the second half of the 16th century. with their unusual dress, unique customs, and specialized trades for earning their livelihood, roma have stood out, and their stay in the country has not been an easy one. they have suffered periodic harassment from the hands of both private citizens and public officials, and the last of the special laws directed against them was repealed only in 1883. even in the second half of the 1980s, finland's 5,000 to 6,000 romani remained a distinct group, separated from the general population both by their own choice and by the fears and the prejudices many finns felt toward them.
finnish roma, like roma elsewhere, chose to live apart from the dominant societal groups. a roma's loyalty was to his or her family and to their people in general. marriages with non-roma were uncommon, and the roma's own language, spoken as a first language only by a few in the 1980s, was used to keep outsiders away. an individual's place within roma society was largely determined by age and by sex, old males having authority. a highly developed system of values and a code of conduct governed a roma's behavior, and when roma sanctions, violent or not, were imposed, for example via "blood feuds," they had far more meaning than any legal or social sanctions of finnish society.
unlike the sami, who lived concentrated in a single region, the romani lived throughout finland. while most sami wore ordinary clothing in their everyday life, romani could be identified by their dress; the men generally wore high boots and the women almost always dressed in very full, long velvet skirts. like most sami, however, roma also had largely abandoned a nomadic way of life and had permanent residences. romani men had for centuries worked as horse traders, but they had adapted themselves to postwar finland by being active as horse breeders and as dealers in cars and scrap metal. women continued their traditional trades of fortune telling and handicrafts.
since the 1960s, finnish authorities have undertaken measures to improve the romani's standard of life. generous state financial arrangements have improved their housing. their low educational level (an estimated 20 percent of adult romani could not read) was raised, in part, through more vocational training. a permanent advisory commission on gypsy affairs was set up in 1968, and in 1970 racial discrimination was outlawed through an addition to the penal code. the law punished blatant acts such as barring romani from restaurants or shops or subjecting them to unusual surveillance by shopkeepers or the police.
there are about 1,300 jews in finland, 800 of whom live in helsinki and most of the remainder live in turku. during the period of swedish rule, jews had been forbidden to live in finland. once the country became part of the russian empire, however, jewish veterans of the tsarist army had the right to settle anywhere they wished within the empire. although constrained by law to follow certain occupations, mainly those connected with the sale of clothes, the jewish community in finland was able to prosper, and by 1890 it numbered around 1,000. finnish independence brought complete civil rights, and during the interwar period there were some 2,000 jews in finland, most of them living in urban areas in the south. during world war ii, finnish authorities refused to deliver jews to the third reich, and the country's jewish community survived the war virtually intact. by the 1980s, assimilation and emigration had significantly reduced the size of the community, and it was only with some difficulty that it maintained synagogues, schools, libraries, and other pertinent institutions.
the community of finnish tatars numbers only about 800. the tatars first came to finland from the russian volga region near nizni novgorod's tatar villages in the mid-19th century and have remained there ever since, active in commerce. the tatars in finland fully integrated into the finnish society at the same time they preserved their religion, mother tongue and ethnic culture.
many finnish natives have emigrated abroad, sometimes running away of war, eg. to sweden, sometimes for economical reasons, eg. to us and canada. current numbers of emigration are not very well discussed in public, but lowering standard of living in finland has forced many persons and families to look for living.
245,864 finnish citizens emigrated abroad between 1990 and 2017. the most popular destinations are sweden (76,269), united kingdom (21,939), united states (18,943), norway (16,971), germany (16,694), spain (14,209) and denmark (9,626).
demographic movement in finland did not end with the appearance of immigrants from sweden in the middle ages. finns who left to work in swedish mines in the 16th century began a national tradition, which continued up through the 1970s, of settling in their neighboring country. during the period of tsarist rule, some 100,000 finns went to russia, mainly to the st. petersburg area. emigration on a large scale began in the second half of the 19th century when finns, along with millions of other europeans, set out for the united states and canada. by 1980 finland had lost an estimated 400,000 of its citizens to these two countries.
a great number of finns emigrated to sweden after world war ii, drawn by that country's prosperity and proximity. emigration began slowly, but, during the 1960s and the second half of the 1970s, tens of thousands left each year for their western neighbor. the peak emigration year was 1970, when 41,000 finns settled in sweden, which caused finland's population actually to fall that year. because many of the migrants later returned to finland, definite figures cannot be calculated, but all told, an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 finns became permanent residents of sweden in the postwar period. the overall youthfulness of these emigrants meant that the quality of the work force available to finnish employers was diminished and that the national birth rate slowed. at one point, every eighth finnish child was born in sweden. finland's swedish-speaking minority was hard hit by this westward migration; its numbers dropped from 350,000 to about 300,000 between 1950 and 1980. by the 1980s, a strong finnish economy had brought an end to large-scale migration to sweden. in fact, the overall population flow was reversed because each year several thousand more finns returned from sweden than left for it.
however significant the long-term effects of external migration on finnish society may have been, migration within the country had a greater impact—especially the migration which took place between the end of world war ii and the mid-1970s, when half the population moved from one part of the country to another. before world war ii, internal migration had first been a centuries-long process of forming settlements ever farther to the north. later, however, beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the coming of finland's tardy industrialization, there was a slow movement from rural regions toward areas in the south where employment could be found.
postwar internal migration began with the resettlement within finland of virtually all the inhabitants of the parts of karelia ceded to the soviet union. somewhat more than 400,000 persons, more than 10 percent of the nation's population, found new homes elsewhere in finland, often in the less settled regions of the east and the north. in these regions, new land, which they cleared for farming, was provided for the refugees; in more populated areas, property was requisitioned. the sudden influx of these settlers was successfully dealt with in just a few years. one of the effects of rural resettlement was an increase in the number of farms during the postwar years, a unique occurrence for industrialized nations of this period.
it was, however, the postwar economic transformation that caused an even larger movement of people within finland, a movement known to finns as the great migration. it was a massive population shift from rural areas, especially those of eastern and northeastern finland, to the urban, industrialized south. people left rural regions because the mechanization of agriculture and the forestry industry had eliminated jobs. the displaced work force went to areas where employment in the expanding industrial and service sectors was available. this movement began in the 1950s, but it was most intense during the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, assuming proportions that in relative terms were unprecedented for a country outside the third world. the great migration left behind rural areas of abandoned farms with reduced and aging populations, and it allowed the creation of a densely populated postindustrial society in the country's south.
the extent of the demographic shift to the south can be shown by the following figures. between 1951 and 1975, the population registered an increase of 655,000. during this period, the small province of uusimaa increased its population by 412,000, growing from 670,000 to 1,092,000; three-quarters of this growth was caused by settlers from other provinces. the population increase experienced by four other southern provinces, the aland islands, turku ja pori, hame, and kymi, taken together with that of uusimaa amounted to 97 percent of the country's total population increase for these years. the population increase of the central and the northern provinces accounted for the remaining 3 percent. provinces that experienced an actual population loss during these years were in the east and the northeast-pohjois-karjala, mikkeli, and kuopio.
one way of visualizing the shift to the south would be to draw a line, bowing slightly to the north, between the port cities of kotka on the gulf of finland and kaskinen on the gulf of bothnia. in 1975 the territory to the south of this line would have contained half of finland's population. ten years earlier, such a line, drawn farther to the north to mark off perhaps 20 percent more area, would have encompassed half the population. one hundred years earlier, half the population would have been distributed throughout more than twice as much territory. another indication of the extent to which finns were located in the south was that by 1980, approximately 90 percent of them lived in the southernmost 41 percent of finland.
in 2018, there were 387,215 foreign-born residents in finland, corresponding to 7.1% of the total population. of these, 261,508 (4.8%) were born outside the eu and 125,707 (2.3%) were born in another eu member state. the largest groups were:
evangelical lutheran church is the largest church in finland, 69.8% of population were its members in the end of year 2018. christian orthodox are the second largest registered group, 1.1% were members of the finnish orthodox church. the number of lutherans has decreased gradually from 98% in year 1900, 95% in year 1950 and 85% in year 2000. in end of 2018, 1.7% of population was in other religious groups, and 27.4% in census register or of unknown religious status.
pentecostalism has approximately 50,000 members in finland. traditionally, it has acted as societies and is thus not visible in statistics of churches.
estimated number of muslims in 2010 was 40,000.
defined as proportion of people in age 15 and over can read and write, the literacy of total population is 100% (2000 est.).
in a study published in march 2016, finland ranked the world’s most literate nation among 61 countries, where enough data was available. the research considered among other things literacy achievement tests, numbers of libraries and newspapers, years of schooling and computer availability.
in 2010 yle reported that 85-90% of somali immigrants are illiterate when they arrive.

the politics of finland take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. finland is a republic whose head of state is president sauli niinistö, who leads the nation's foreign policy and is the supreme commander of the finnish defence forces. finland's head of government is the prime minister, who leads the nation's executive branch, called the finnish government. legislative power is vested in the parliament of finland (, ), and the government has limited rights to amend or extend legislation. because the constitution of finland vests power to both the president and government, the president has veto power over parliamentary decisions, although this power can be overruled by a majority vote in the parliament.
the judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches. the judiciary consists of two systems: regular courts and administrative courts. the judiciary's two systems are headed by the supreme court and the supreme administrative court, respectively. administrative courts process cases in which official decisions are contested. there is no constitutional court in finland – the constitutionality of a law can be contested only as applied to an individual court case.
the citizens of finland enjoy many individual and political freedoms, and suffrage is universal at age 18; finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to run for public office.
the country's population is ethnically homogeneous with no sizable immigrant population. few tensions exist between the finnish-speaking majority and the swedish-speaking minority, although in certain circles there is an unending debate about the status of the swedish language.
finland's labor agreements are based on collective bargaining. bargaining is highly centralized and often the government participates to coordinate fiscal policy. finland has universal validity of collective labour agreements and often, but not always, the trade unions, employers, and the government reach a national income policy agreement. significant finnish trade unions include sak, sttk, akava, and ek.
the economist intelligence unit has rated finland a full democracy.
a finnish political identity and distinctively finnish politics first developed under the russian rule in the country from 1809 to 1917. during the era finland had an autonomous position within the russian empire with its own legislative powers. however, all bills had to be signed into law by the russian emperor who was the grand duke of finland. also, military power was firmly in russian hands. previously finland had been a part of sweden and did not have any political institutions of its own, rather people of finnish ethnicity participated in swedish politics.
during the russian rule, political activism gradually grew demanding more autonomy and eventually independence for finland. however, several generations of struggle were needed before the finnish nationalist movement realized its objectives. one form of activism was the underscoring of finnish language, also at the expense of the primacy of swedish language that was still widely spoken and the official language of the country. numerous members of the swedish-speaking community entered the campaign, adopting finnish as their language and exchanging their swedish family names for finnish ones. finnish journals were founded, and finnish became an official language in 1863. by the end of the century, there was a slight majority of finnish-speaking students at the university of helsinki, and finnish-speakers made up sizable portions of the professions.
over time finland's modernizing economy encouraged the formation of social groups with specific, and sometimes opposing, interests. in addition to the finnish movement's old and young finns, other political organizations came into being. because the existing political groups did not adequately represent labor's interests, a workers' party was formed at the end of the century. in 1903 it became the finnish social democratic party (suomen sosialidemokraattinen puolue or sdp). at the same time labor was organizing itself, the farmers began a cooperative movement; in 1907 they formed the agrarian party (maalaisliitto). the swedish people's party (svenska folkpartiet or sfp), also dating from this period, was formed to serve the entire swedish-speaking population.
the grand duchy's relationship with st. petersburg began to deteriorate in the 1890s. the nervousness of tsarist officials about finnish loyalty in wartime prompted measures to bind finland more closely to the empire. the campaign of "russification" ended only with finland's independence in 1917. in retrospect, the campaign can be seen as a failure, but for several decades it caused much turmoil within finland, reaching its most extreme point with the assassination of the governor general in 1904. the first russian revolution, that of 1905, allowed finns to discard their antiquated diet and to replace it with a unicameral legislature, the eduskunta, elected through universal suffrage. finland became the first european nation in which women had the franchise. the first national election, that of 1907, yielded europe's largest social democratic parliamentary faction. in a single step, finland went from being one of europe's most politically backward countries to being one of its most advanced. nonetheless, frequent dissolutions at the hands of the tsar permitted the eduskunta to achieve little before independence.
the second russian revolution allowed finland to break away from the russian empire, and independence was declared on december 6, 1917. within weeks, domestic political differences led to a finnish civil war that lasted until may 1918, when right-wing forces, with some german assistance, were able to claim victory. as a consequence, finland began its existence as an independent state with a considerable segment of its people estranged from the holders of power, a circumstance that caused much strife in finnish politics.
after right-wing dreams of a monarchy based on the coronation of german prince as the king of finland came crumbling down with the german defeat in the world war, a republic was formed. in mid-1919, finns agreed on a new constitution, one that constructed a modern parliamentary system of government from existing political institutions and traditions. the 200-seat unicameral parliament, the eduskunta, was retained. a cabinet, the council
of state, was fashioned from the senate of the tsarist period. a powerful presidency, derived, in part at least, from the office of governor general, was created and provided with a mixture of powers and duties that, in other countries, might be shared by such figures as king, president, and prime minister. also included in the new governmental system was an independent judiciary. the powers of the three branches of government were controlled through
an overlapping of powers, rather than a strict separation of powers.
finland faced numerous political and economic difficulties in the interwar years, but it surmounted them better than many other european countries. despite the instability of many short-lived governments, the political system held together during the first decades of independence. while other countries succumbed to right-wing forces, finland had only a brush with fascism. communist organizations were banned, and their representatives in the eduskunta arrested, but the sdp was able to recover from wounds sustained during the civil war and was returned to power. in 1937 the party formed the first of the so-called red-earth coalitions with the agrarian league, the most common party combination of the next fifty years, one that brought together the parties representing the two largest social groups. the language problem was largely resolved by provisions in the constitution that protected the rights of the swedish-speaking minority.
finland's official foreign policy of neutrality in the interwar period could not offset the strategic importance of the country's territory to nazi germany and to the soviet union. the latter was convinced that it had a defensive
need to ensure that finland would not be used as an avenue for attack on its northwestern areas, especially on leningrad. moreover, nazi germany and the soviet union had agreed in the molotov–ribbentrop pact to divide the countries of central europe between themselves. accordingly, the soviet union launched an attack of finland in november 1939. a valiant finnish defense slowed the invaders, but in march 1940 the winter war ended when finland agreed to cede to the soviets about 10 percent of finnish territory and to permit a soviet military base on finnish soil. in june 1941 finland joined germany as cobelligerent in its attack on the soviet union. in what finns call the continuation war, finland confined its military actions to areas near its prewar borders. in the fall of 1944, finland made a separate peace with the soviet union, one that was conditional on its ceding territory, granting basing rights, agreeing to onerous reparation payments, and expelling german forces from its territory. nevertheless, finland succeeded in being one of only two belligerents in europe that stayed never occupied, independent and with its democracy intact throughout the war, the other being the united kingdom.
by the early 1950s, the patterns of postwar finnish politics were established. no one group was dominant, but the agrarian league held the presidency under urho kekkonen for a quarter century. kekkonen first became president in 1956, and secured a place for the conservative agrarian league as almost a permanent governing party until the late 1980s. in 1966 it changed its name to the center party (keskustapuolue or keskusta) in an attempt to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate, but it still was not successful in penetrating southern coastal finland. meanwhile, the social democratic party historically the largest party, still remained strong but it was often riven by dissension. in addition, it had to share the leftist vote with the communist party of finland (suomen kommunistinen puolue or skp). as a consequence, right-wing parties never had to face a united left. in the 1980s, the communists had severe problems adjusting to new social conditions, and they split into several warring groups. as a result, their movement had a marginal position in finnish politics. the sfp, a moderate centrist party with liberal and conservative wings, had a slightly declining number of seats in the parliament eduskunta, but its position in the middle of the political spectrum often made it indispensable for coalition governments. the national coalition party (kansallinen kokoomuspuolue or kokoomus), rigidly conservative in the interwar period, gradually became more moderate and grew stronger, surpassing the center party in the number of parliamentary seats in 1979. excluded from a role in government for decades, possibly because it had been more right-wing earlier, the kokoomus participated in the government formed after the national elections of 1987, supplying the prime minister, harri holkeri. the liberal party of the postwar period was never strong, and it had a negligible role by the 1980s and eventually was dissolved.
a number of smaller parties, protest parties, and parties representing quite distinct groups filled out the list of about a dozen organizations that regularly vied for public office. pensioners and activist christians each had their own party, and environmentalists won several seats in the 1983 and the 1987 national elections — a movement which later grew to the modern green party during the 1990s. the most active of the protest parties was the finnish rural party (suomen maaseudun puolue or smp), which managed to take votes from both the center party and leftist parties. it scored its first big successes in the 1970 national elections. since then its electoral results
have varied considerably. by late 1980s, it seemed a spent force, but arose again as a populist right-wing party after changing its name to perussuomalaiset or true finns.
after the 1966 national elections president kekkonen succeeded in forming a popular front coalition government that contained communists, socialists, and members of the center party. although this government lasted only two years and was succeeded for another decade by short-lived coalition and caretaker civil service governments, it was the beginning of what finns call the politics of consensus. by the 1980s, consensus politics had become so dominant that some observers claimed that finnish politics, long so bitter and contentious, had become the most boring in western europe. although the larger parties differed on specific issues, and personal rivalries could be poisonous, there was broad agreement about domestic and foreign policy. the cabinet put in place after the 1983 elections, consisting mainly of social democrats and members of the center party, completed its whole term of office, the first government to do so in the postwar period. this ushered in an era of relatively long lasting governments where leadership changes took place mainly through regular elections.
a foundation of the politics of consensus was the success of the system of broad incomes agreements that has characterized finland's employee-employer relations in recent decades. the first of these, the liinamaa agreement, dated from 1968. by the 1980s, the process was so regular as to seem institutionalized. with about 80 percent of the work force as members, unions negotiated incomes agreements with employers' organizations. the government often helped in the talks and subsequently proposed legislation embodying social welfare measures or financial measures that underpinned the agreements. the process was successful at increasing labor peace in a country that had been
racked by strikes for the first decades after world war ii. although there were complaints that the agreements bypassed political channels or excluded minority opinion, the obvious prosperity they had helped bring about made the incomes policy system and the politics of consensus highly popular.
the current version of the constitution of finland was written on march 1, 2000. the first iteration of the constitution was adopted on july 17, 1919. the original comprised four constitutional laws and several amendments, which the latter replaced.
according to the constitution, the legislative powers are exercised by the parliament, the governmental powers are exercised by the president of the republic and the government, and the judicial powers are exercised by government-independent courts of law. the supreme court may request legislation that interprets or modifies existing laws. judges are appointed by the president.
the constitution of finland and its place in the judicial system are unusual in that there is no constitutional court and the supreme court does not have the explicit right to declare a law unconstitutional. in principle, the constitutionality of laws in finland is verified by a simple vote by parliament (see "parliamentary sovereignty"). however, the parliament's constitutional law committee reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. in practice, the constitutional law committee fulfils the duties of a constitutional court. a finnish peculiarity is the possibility of making exceptions to the constitution in ordinary laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. an example of such a law is the state of preparedness act, which gives the government certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. as these powers, which correspond to us executive orders, affect constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. however, it can be repealed in the same manner as an ordinary law. in addition to preview by the constitutional law committee, all finnish courts are obligated to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the constitution and a regular law. such a case is, however, very rare.
some matters are decided by the president of finland, the head of state, in plenary meetings with the government, echoing the constitutional history of a privy council. the president is otherwise not present in the government, but decides on issues such as personal appointments and pardons on the advice of the relevant minister. in the ministries, matters of secondary importance are decided by individual ministers, advised by the minister's state secretary. the prime minister and the other ministers in the government are responsible for their actions in office to the parliament.
finland has a parliamentary system, even if the president of finland is formally responsible for foreign policy. most executive power lies in the cabinet (the finnish government) headed by the prime minister. responsibility for forming the cabinet out of several political parties and negotiating its platform is granted to the leader of the party gaining largest support in the elections for the parliament. this person also becomes prime minister of the cabinet. any minister and the cabinet as a whole, however, must have continuing trust of the parliament and may be voted out, resign or be replaced. the government is made up of the prime minister and the ministers for the various departments of the central government as well as an "ex officio" member, the chancellor of justice.
in the official usage, the "cabinet" ("valtioneuvosto") are the ministers including the prime minister and the chancellor of justice, while the "government" ("hallitus") is the cabinet presided by the president. in the popular usage, "hallitus" (with the president) may also refer to "valtioneuvosto" (without the president).
though finland has a primarily parliamentary system, the president has some notable powers. the foreign policy is led by the president in co-operation with the government, and the same applies to matters concerning national security. the main executive power lies in the cabinet, which is headed by the prime minister. before the 2000 constitutional rewrite, the president enjoyed more governing power.
elected for a six-year term, the president:
the government is made up of the prime minister and other ministers for the various ministries of the central government as well as an "ex officio" member, the chancellor of justice. ministers are not obliged to be members of parliament and need not be formally identified with any political party.
the government produces most of the material that the parliament deals with, such as proposals for new laws or legislative reforms, and the annual budget. the ministers each direct their ministries with relative independence. the current cabinet has 17 ministers in 12 ministries. the number of ministers can be decided by the government.
the prime minister’s office and eleven other ministries make up the government of finland.
the head of government is the prime minister, currently juha sipilä, who has held the office since 29 may 2015. the prime minister designate is subject to election by the parliament and, if elected, he or she —along with all the other ministers upon the nomination of the prime minister— are appointed by the president of finland. all the ministers shall be finnish citizens, known to be honest and competent.
the ministries function as administrative and political experts and prepare government decisions within their mandates. they also represent their relevant administrative sectors in domestic and international cooperation.
new laws are drafted in ministries. there is a tradition of substantial ministerial independence in law drafting. the drafts are then reviewed by government and parliament before enactment. the final legislative power is vested in parliament, in conjunction with the president of the republic, according to the finnish constitution.
there are 12 ministries in finland. as the government tends to have more ministers than ministries, some ministries, such as the ministry of finance, are associated with multiple ministers.
the 200-member unicameral parliament of finland ("eduskunta" (finnish), "riksdag" (swedish)). it is the supreme legislative authority in finland. the parliament may alter the constitution of finland, bring about the resignation of the government, and override presidential vetoes. its acts are not subject to judicial review. legislation may be initiated by the government, or one of members of parliament, who are elected for a four-year term on the basis of proportional representation through open list multi-member districts. persons 18 or older, except military personnel on active duty and a few high judicial officials, are eligible for election. the regular parliamentary term is four years; however, the president may dissolve the eduskunta and order new elections at the request of the prime minister and after consulting the speaker of parliament.
the parliament has, since equal and common suffrage was introduced in 1906, been dominated by secular conservatives, the centre party (former agrarian union), and social democrats. nevertheless, none of these has held a single-party majority, with the notable exception of 1916 elections where social democrats gained 103 of the 200 seats. after 1944, communists were a factor to consider for a few decades, and the finnish people's democratic league, formed by communists and others to the left of social democrats, was the largest party after 1958 elections. support for communists decreased sharply in the early 1980s, while later on the same decade environmentalists formed the green league, which is now one of the largest parties. the swedish people's party represents the finland-swedes, especially in language politics. the relative strengths of the parties vary only slightly in the elections due to the proportional election from multi-member districts, but there are some visible long-term trends.
there is no constitutional court; matters concerning constitutional rights or constitutional law are processed by the constitutional committee of the parliament ("perustuslakivaliokunta"). additionally, the constitutional committee has the sole power to refer a case to the high court of impeachment ("valtakunnanoikeus") and to authorize police investigations for this purpose.
in addition to the parliament, the cabinet and president may produce regulations ("asetus") through a rulemaking process. these give more specific instructions on how to apply statutes, which often explicitly delegate regulation of specific details to the government. regulations must be based on an existing law, and they can clarify and specify, but not contradict the statute. furthermore, the rights of an individual must always be based on a statute, not a regulation. often the statute and the regulation come in similarly named pairs. for example, the law on primary education lists the subjects to the taught, and the regulation specifies the required number of teaching hours. most of regulations are given by the cabinet, but the president may give regulations concerning national security. before 2000, the president had the right to enact regulations on matters not governed by parliamentary law, but this power was removed, and existing regulations were converted into regular statutes by the parliament.
finland's proportional representation system encourages a multitude of political parties and has resulted in many coalition-cabinets. formerly the life expectancy of the coalition governments has been short, but since about 1980 the trend has been that the same coalition rules for the whole period between elections.
finland elects on national level a head of state—the president—and a legislature. the president is elected for a six-year term by the people. the parliament has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies. finland has a multi-party system, with multiple strong parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.
in addition to the presidential and parliamentary elections, there are european parliament elections every five years, and local municipal elections (held simultaneously in every municipality) every four years.
finland has a civil law system, which is based on swedish law, with the judiciary exercising limited powers. proceedings are inquisitorial, where judges preside, conduct finding of fact, adjudication and giving of sanctions such as sentences; no juries are used. in e.g. criminal and family-related proceedings in local courts, the panel of judges may include both lay judges and professional judges, while all appeals courts and administrative courts consist only of professional judges. precedent is not binding, with the exception of supreme court and supreme administrative court decisions.
the judicial system of finland is divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with responsibility for litigation between the individuals and the administrative organs of the state and the communities. finnish law is codified and its court system consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the supreme court. the administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the supreme administrative court. the administrative process has more popularity as it is cheaper and has lower financial risk to the person making claims. in addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. there is also a high court of impeachment for criminal charges (for an offence in office) against the president of the republic, the justices of the supreme courts, members of the government, the chancellor of justice and the ombudsman of parliament.
although there is no writ of habeas corpus or bail, the maximum period of pre-trial detention has been reduced to four days. for further detention, a court must order the imprisonment. one does not have the right for one phonecall: the police officer leading the investigation may inform relatives or similar if the investigation permits. however, a lawyer can be invited. search warrants are not strictly needed, and are usually issued by a police officer. wiretapping does need a court order.
finland has a civil law (roman law) system with an inquisitorial procedure. in accordance with the separation of powers, the "trias politica" principle, courts of law are independent of other administration. they base their decisions solely on the law in force. criminal cases, civil cases and petitionary matters are dealt in 27 district courts, and then, if the decision is not satisfactory to the involved parties, can be applied in six courts of appeal. the supreme court of finland serves as the court of last instance. appeals against decisions by authorities are considered in six regional administrative courts, with the supreme administrative court of finland as the court of last instance. the president appoints all professional judges for life. municipal councils appoint lay judges to district courts.
finland is divided into 313 democratically independent municipalities, which are grouped into 70 sub-regions.
as the highest-level division, finland is divided into 19 regions.
a municipality in finland can choose to call itself either a "city" or "municipality". a municipality is governed by a municipal council (or a city council) elected by proportional representation once every four years. democratic decision-making takes place on either the municipal or national level with few exceptions.
until 2009, the state organization was divided into six provinces. however, the provinces were abolished altogether in 2010. today, state local presence on mainland finland is provided by 6 regional state administrative agencies ("aluehallintovirasto", "avi"), and 15 centres for economic development, transport and the environment ("elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus", "ely-keskus"). regional state administrative agencies have mostly law enforcement, rescue and judicial duties: police, fire and rescue, emergency readiness, basic services, environmental permits and enforcement and occupational health and safety protection. the centres implement labor and industrial policy, provide employment and immigration services, and promote culture; maintain highways, other transport networks and infrastructure; and protect, monitor and manage the environment, land use and water resources.
the åland islands are located near the 60th parallel between sweden and finland. they enjoy local autonomy by virtue of an international convention of 1921, implemented most recently by the act on åland self-government of 1951. the islands are further distinguished by the fact that they are entirely swedish-speaking. government is vested in the provincial council, which consists of 30 delegates elected directly by åland's citizens.
finland is divided between six regional state administrative agencies, which are responsible for basic public services and legal permits, such as rescue services and environmental permits. the 15 centres for economic development, transport and the environment (ely centres) are responsible for the regional implementation and development tasks of the central government.
the basic units for organising government and public services in finland are the municipalities. as of 2017, there are 311 municipalities, which incorporate the entire country.
indirect public administration supplements and supports the authorities in managing the tasks of the welfare society. it comprises organisations which are not authorities, but which carry out public tasks or execute public powers. examples of this are issuing hunting licences or carrying out motor vehicle inspection.
after the second world war, paasikivi–kekkonen doctrine was the foreign policy doctrine which aimed at finland's survival as an independent sovereign, democratic, and capitalist country in the immediate proximity of the soviet union. after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991, finland freed itself from the last restrictions imposed on it by the paris peace treaties of 1947. the finnish-soviet agreement of friendship, co-operation, and mutual assistance (and the restrictions included therein) was annulled but finland recognised the russian federation as the successor of the ussr and was quick to draft bilateral treaties of goodwill as well as reallocating soviet debts.
finland deepened her participation in the european integration by joining the european union with sweden and austria in 1995. it could be perhaps said that the country's policy of neutrality has been moderated to "military non-alignment" with an emphasis on maintaining a competent independent defence. peacekeeping under the auspices of the united nations is the only real extra-national military responsibility which finland undertakes.
finland is highly dependent on foreign trade and actively participates in international cooperation. finland is a member of the european union, united nations and world bank group and in many of their member organizations.
finland-russia relations have been under pressure with annexation of crimea by the russian federation, which finland considers illegal. together with the rest of the european union, finland enforces sanctions against russia that followed. still, economic relations have not entirely deteriorated: 11.2% of imports to finland are from russia, and 5.7% of exports from finland are to russia, and cooperation between finnish and russian authorities continues.

finland has a highly industrialised, mixed economy with a per capita output similar to that of other western european economies such as france, germany and united kingdom but slightly lower than sweden. the largest sector of the economy is services at 72.7 percent, followed by manufacturing and refining at 31.4 percent. primary production is 2.9 percent.
with respect to foreign trade, the key economic sector is manufacturing. the largest industries are electronics (21.6 percent), machinery, vehicles and other engineered metal products (21.1 percent), forest industry (13.1 percent), and chemicals (10.9 percent). finland has timber and several mineral and freshwater resources. forestry, paper factories, and the agricultural sector (on which taxpayers spend around 2 billion euro annually) are politically sensitive to rural residents. the greater helsinki area generates around a third of gdp.
in a 2004 oecd comparison, high-technology manufacturing in finland ranked second largest after ireland. knowledge-intensive services have also ranked the smallest and slow-growth sectors – especially agriculture and low-technology manufacturing – second largest after ireland. investment was below expected. overall short-term outlook was good and gdp growth has been above many eu peers. finland has the 4th largest knowledge economy in europe, behind sweden, denmark and the uk. the economy of finland tops the ranking of global information technology 2014 report by the world economic forum for concerted output between business sector, scholarly production and the governmental assistance on information and communications technology.
finland is highly integrated in the global economy, and international trade is a third of gdp. the european union makes 60 percent of the total trade. the largest trade flows are with germany, russia, sweden, the united kingdom, the united states, netherlands and china. trade policy is managed by the european union, where finland has traditionally been among the free trade supporters, except for agriculture. finland is the only nordic country to have joined the eurozone; denmark and sweden have retained their traditional currencies, whereas iceland and norway are not members of the eu at all.
being geographically distant from central europe in relation to other nordic countries, finland struggled behind in terms of industrialization apart from the production of paper, which partially replaced the export of timber solely as a raw material towards the end of the nineteenth century. but as a relatively poor country, it was vulnerable to shocks to the economy such as the great famine of 1867-1868, which wiped out 15 percent of the population.
until the 1930s, the finnish economy was predominantly agrarian and, as late as in the 1950s, more than half the population and 40 percent of output were still in the primary sector.
property rights were strong. while nationalization committees were set up in france and the united kingdom, finland avoided nationalizations. after failed experiments with protectionism, finland eased restrictions and concluded a free trade agreement with the european community in 1973, making its markets more competitive. local education markets expanded and an increasing number of finns also went abroad to study in the united states or western europe, bringing back advanced skills. there was a quite common, but pragmatic-minded, credit and investment cooperation by state and corporations, though it was considered with suspicion. support for capitalism was widespread. savings rate hovered among the world's highest, at around 8% until the 1980s. in the beginning of the 1970s, finland's gdp per capita reached the level of japan and the uk. finland's economic development shared many aspects with export-led asian countries. the official policy of neutrality enabled finland to trade both with western and comecon markets. significant bilateral trade was conducted with the soviet union, but this did not grow into a dependence.
like other nordic countries, finland has liberalized its system of economic regulation since late 1980s. financial and product market regulations were modified. some state enterprises were privatized and some tax rates were altered.
in 1991, the finnish economy fell into a severe recession. this was caused by a combination of economic overheating (largely due to a change in the banking laws in 1986 which made credit much more accessible), depressed markets with key trading partners (particularly the swedish and soviet markets) as well as local markets, slow growth with other trading partners, and the disappearance of the soviet bilateral trade. stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. the growth in the 1980s was based on debt, and when the defaults began rolling in, gdp declined by 13% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. the crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. politicians struggled to cut spending and the public debt doubled to around 60% of gdp. much of the economic growth in the 1980s was based on debt financing, and the debt defaults led to a savings and loan crisis. a total of over 10 billion euros were used to bail out failing banks, which led to banking sector consolidation.
after devaluations, the depression bottomed out in 1993.
finland joined the european union in 1995. the central bank was given an inflation-targeting mandate until finland joined the euro zone. the growth rate has since been one of the highest of oecd countries and finland has topped many indicators of national performance.
finland was one of the 11 countries joining the third phase of the economic and monetary union of the european union, adopting the euro as the country's currency, on 1 january 1999. the national currency markka (fim) was withdrawn from circulation and replaced by the euro (eur) at the beginning of 2002.
the following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017. inflation under 2% is in green.
finland's climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge. the country lies between 60° and 70° north latitude - as far north as alaska - and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts. however, because the gulf stream and the north atlantic drift current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land area, finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. in response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops. most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to develop fertility. irrigation was generally not necessary, but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water.
until the late nineteenth century, finland's isolation required that most farmers concentrate on producing grains to meet the country's basic food needs. in the fall, farmers planted rye; in the spring, southern and central farmers started oats, while northern farmers seeded barley. farms also grew small quantities of potatoes, other root crops, and legumes. nevertheless, the total area under cultivation was still small. cattle grazed in the summer and consumed hay in the winter. essentially self-sufficient, finland engaged in very limited agricultural trade.
this traditional, almost autarkic, production pattern shifted sharply during the late nineteenth century, when inexpensive imported grain from russia and the united states competed effectively with local grain. at the same time, rising domestic and foreign demand for dairy products and the availability of low-cost imported cattle feed made dairy and meat production much more profitable. these changes in market conditions induced finland's farmers to switch from growing staple grains to producing meat and dairy products, setting a pattern that persisted into the late 1980s.
in response to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. this policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in finland than in most other countries. barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938 finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.
the disruptions caused by the winter war and the continuation war caused further food shortages, especially when finland ceded territory, including about one-tenth of its farmland, to the soviet union. the experiences of the depression and the war years persuaded the finns to secure independent food supplies to prevent shortages in future conflicts.
after the war, the first challenge was to resettle displaced farmers. most refugee farmers were given farms that included some buildings and land that had already been in production, but some had to make do with "cold farms," that is, land not in production that usually had to be cleared or drained before crops could be sown. the government sponsored large-scale clearing and draining operations that expanded the area suitable for farming. as a result of the resettlement and land-clearing programs, the area under cultivation expanded by about 450,000 hectares, reaching about 2.4 million hectares by the early 1960s. finland thus came to farm more land than ever before, an unusual development in a country that was simultaneously experiencing rapid industrial growth.
during this period of expansion, farmers introduced modern production practices. the widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply improved crop yields. yet the modernisation process again made farm production dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. by 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. in the aftermath of the oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. the existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. another weak point was the existence of many fields with open drainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works. at that time, about 1 million hectares had underground drainage, and agricultural authorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares. despite these shortcomings, finland's agriculture was efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other european countries.
forests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. as in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries.
finland's wet climate and rocky soils are ideal for forests. tree stands do well throughout the country, except in some areas north of the arctic circle. in 1980 the forested area totaled about 19.8 million hectares, providing 4 hectares of forest per capita—far above the european average of about 0.5 hectares. the proportion of forest land varied considerably from region to region. in the central lake plateau and in the eastern and northern provinces, forests covered up to 80 percent of the land area, but in areas with better conditions for agriculture, especially in the southwest, forests accounted for only 50 to 60 percent of the territory. the main commercial tree species—pine, spruce, and birch—supplied raw material to the sawmill, pulp, and paper industries. the forests also produced sizable aspen and elder crops.
the heavy winter snows and the network of waterways were used to move logs to the mills. loggers were able to drag cut trees over the winter snow to the roads or water bodies. in the southwest, the sledding season lasted about 100 days per year; the season was even longer to the north and the east. the country's network of lakes and rivers facilitated log floating, a cheap and rapid means of transport. each spring, crews floated the logs downstream to collection points; tugs towed log bundles down rivers and across lakes to processing centers. the waterway system covered much of the country, and by the 1980s finland had extended roadways and railroads to areas not served by waterways, effectively opening up all of the country's forest reserves to commercial use.
forestry and farming were closely linked. during the twentieth century, government land redistribution programmes had made forest ownership widespread, allotting forestland to most farms. in the 1980s, private farmers controlled 35 percent of the country's forests; other persons held 27 percent; the government, 24 percent; private corporations, 9 percent; and municipalities and other public bodies, 5 percent. the forestlands owned by farmers and by other people—some 350,000 plots—were the best, producing 75 to 80 percent of the wood consumed by industry; the state owned much of the poorer land, especially that in the north.
the ties between forestry and farming were mutually beneficial. farmers supplemented their incomes with earnings from selling their wood, caring for forests, or logging; forestry made many otherwise marginal farms viable. at the same time, farming communities maintained roads and other infrastructure in rural areas, and they provided workers for forest operations. indeed, without the farming communities in sparsely populated areas, it would have been much more difficult to continue intensive logging operations and reforestation in many prime forest areas.
the ministry of agriculture and forestry has carried out forest inventories and drawn up silvicultural plans. according to surveys, between 1945 and the late 1970s foresters had cut trees faster than the forests could regenerate them. nevertheless, between the early 1950s and 1981, finland was able to boost the total area of its forests by some 2.7 million hectares and to increase forest stands under 40 years of age by some 3.2 million hectares. beginning in 1965, the country instituted plans that called for expanding forest cultivation, draining peatland and waterlogged areas, and replacing slow-growing trees with faster-growing varieties. by the mid-1980s, the finns had drained 5.5 million hectares, fertilized 2.8 million hectares, and cultivated 3.6 million hectares. thinning increased the share of trees that would produce suitable lumber, while improved tree varieties increased productivity by as much as 30 percent.
comprehensive silvicultural programmes had made it possible for the finns simultaneously to increase forest output and to add to the amount and value of the growing stock. by the mid-1980s, finland's forests produced nearly 70 million cubic meters of new wood each year, considerably more than was being cut. during the postwar period, the annual cut increased by about 120 percent to about 50 million cubic meters. wood burning fell to one-fifth the level of the immediate postwar years, freeing up wood supplies for the wood-processing industries, which consumed between 40 million and 45 million cubic meters per year. indeed, industry demand was so great that finland needed to import 5 million to 6 million cubic meters of wood each year.
to maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. in 1984 the government published the forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the ministry of agriculture and forestry. the plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3 percent per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses. it also called for enlarging the average size of private forest holdings, increasing the area used for forests, and extending forest cultivation and thinning. if successful, the plan would make it possible to raise wood deliveries by roughly one-third by the end of the twentieth century. finnish officials believed that such growth was necessary if finland was to maintain its share in world markets for wood and paper products.
since the 1990s, finnish industry, which for centuries had relied on the country's vast forests, has become increasingly dominated by electronics and services, as globalization lead to a decline of more traditional industries. outsourcing resulted in more manufacturing being transferred abroad, with finnish-based industry focusing to a greater extent on r&d and hi-tech electronics.
the finnish electronics and electrotechnics industry relies on heavy investment in r&d, and has been accelerated by the liberalisation of global markets. electrical engineering started in the late 19th century with generators and electric motors built by gottfried strömberg, now part of the abb group. other finnish companies – such as instru, vaisala and neles (now part of metso) - have succeeded in areas such as industrial automation, medical and meteorological technology. nokia was once a world leader in mobile telecommunications.
finland has an abundance of minerals, but many large mines have closed down, and most raw materials are now imported. for this reason, companies now tend to focus on high added-value processing of metals. the exports include steel, copper, chromium, zinc and nickel, and finished products such as steel roofing and cladding, welded steel pipes, copper pipe and coated sheets. outokumpu is known for developing the flash smelting process for copper production and stainless steel.
with regard to vehicles, the finnish motor industry consists mostly of manufacturers of tractors (valtra, formerly valmet tractor), forest machines (f.ex. ponsse), military vehicles (sisu, patria), trucks (sisu auto), buses and valmet automotive, a contract manufacturer, whose factory in uusikaupunki produces mercedes-benz cars. shipbuilding is an important industry: the world's largest cruise ships are built in finland; also, the finnish company wärtsilä produces the world's largest diesel engines and has market share of 47%. in addition, finland also produces train rolling stock.
the manufacturing industry is a significant employer of about 400,000 people.
the chemical industry is one of the finland's largest industrial sectors with its roots in tar making in the 17th century. it produces an enormous range of products for the use of other industrial sectors, especially for forestry and agriculture. in addition, its produces plastics, chemicals, paints, oil products, pharmaceuticals, environmental products, biotech products and petrochemicals. in the beginning of this millennium, biotechnology was regarded as one of the most promising high-tech sectors in finland. in 2006 it was still considered promising, even though it had not yet become "the new nokia".
forest products has been the major export industry in the past, but diversification and growth of the economy has reduced its share. in the 1970s, the pulp and paper industry accounted for half of finnish exports. although this share has shrank, pulp and paper is still a major industry with 52 sites across the country. furthermore, several of large international corporations in this business are based in finland. stora enso and upm were placed #1 and #3 by output in the world, both producing more than ten million tons. m-real and myllykoski also appear on the top 100 list.
finland's energy supply is divided as follows: nuclear power - 26%, net imports - 20%, hydroelectric power - 16%, combined production district heat - 18%, combined production industry - 13%, condensing power - 6%.
one half of all the energy consumed in finland goes to industry, one fifth to heating buildings and one fifth to transport. lacking indigenous fossil fuel resources, finland has been an energy importer. this might change in the future since finland is currently building its fifth and approved the building permits for its sixth and seventh reactors. there are some uranium resources in finland, but to date no commercially viable deposits have been identified for exclusive mining of uranium. however, permits have been granted to talvivaara to produce uranium from the tailings of their nickel-cobalt mine.
notable companies in finland include nokia, the former market leader in mobile telephony; stora enso, the largest paper manufacturer in the world; neste oil, an oil refining and marketing company; upm-kymmene, the third largest paper manufacturer in the world; aker finnyards, the manufacturer of the world's largest cruise ships (such as royal caribbean's "freedom of the seas"); rovio mobile, video game developer most notable for creating angry birds; kone, a manufacturer of elevators and escalators; wärtsilä, a producer of power plants and ship engines; and finnair, the largest helsinki-vantaa based international airline. additionally, many nordic design firms are headquartered in finland. these include the fiskars owned iittala group, artek a furniture design firm co-created by alvar aalto, and marimekko made famous by jacqueline kennedy onassis. finland has sophisticated financial markets comparable to the uk in efficiency. though foreign investment is not as high as some other european countries, the largest foreign-headquartered companies included names such as abb, tellabs, carlsberg, and siemens.
around 70-80% of the equity quoted on the helsinki stock exchange are owned by foreign-registered entities. the larger companies get most of their revenue from abroad, and the majority of their employees work outside the country. cross-shareholding has been abolished and there is a trend towards an anglo-saxon style of corporate governance. however, only around 15% of residents have invested in stock market, compared to 20% in france, and 50% in the us.
between 2000-2003, early stage venture capital investments relative to gdp were 8.5 percent against 4 percent in the eu and 11.5 in the us. later stage investments fell to the eu median. invest in finland and other programs attempt to attract investment. in 2000 fdi from finland to overseas was 20 billion euro and from overseas to finland 7 billion euro. acquisitions and mergers have internationalized business in finland.
although some privatization has been gradually done, there are still several state-owned companies of importance. the government keeps them as strategic assets or because they are natural monopoly. these include e.g. neste oil, vr (rail), finnair, vtt (research) and itella (mail). depending on the strategic importance, the government may hold either 100%, 51% or less than 50% stock. most of these have been transformed into regular limited companies, but some are quasi-governmental ("liikelaitos"), with debt backed by the state, as in the case of vtt.
finland's income is generated by the approximately 1.8 million private sector workers, who make an average 25.1 euro per hour (before the median 60% tax wedge) in 2007. according to a 2003 report, residents worked on average around 10 years for the same employer and around 5 different jobs over a lifetime. 62 percent worked for small and medium-sized enterprises. female employment rate was high and gender segregation on career choices was higher than in the us. in 1999 part-time work rate was one of the smallest in oecd.
future liabilities are dominated by the pension deficit. unlike in sweden, where pension savers can manage their investments, in finland employers choose a pension fund for the employee. the pension funding rate is higher than in most western european countries, but still only a portion of it is funded and pensions exclude health insurances and other unaccounted promises. directly held public debt has been reduced to around 32 percent in 2007. in 2007, the average household savings rate was -3.8 and household debt 101 percent of annual disposable income, a typical level in europe.
in 2008, the oecd reported that "the gap between rich and poor has widened more in finland than in any other wealthy industrialised country over the past decade" and that "finland is also one of the few countries where inequality of incomes has grown between the rich and the middle-class, and not only between rich and poor."
in 2006, there were 2,381,500 households of average size 2.1 people. forty percent of households consisted of single person, 32 percent two and 28 percent three or more. there were 1.2 million residential buildings in finland and the average residential space was 38 square metres per person. the average residential property (without land) cost 1,187 euro per square metre and residential land on 8.6 euro per square metre. consumer energy prices were 8-12 euro cent per kilowatt hour. 74 percent of households had a car. there were 2.5 million cars and 0.4 other vehicles.
around 92 percent have mobile phones and 58 percent internet connection at home. the average total household consumption was 20,000 euro, out of which housing at around 5500 euro, transport at around 3000 euro, food and beverages excluding alcoholic at around 2500 euro, recreation and culture at around 2000 euro. upper-level white-collar households (409,653) consumed an average 27,456 euro, lower-level white-collar households (394,313) 20,935 euro, and blue-collar households (471,370) 19,415 euro.
the unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2015. the employment rate is (persons aged 15–64) 66.8%. unemployment security benefits for those seeking employment are at an average oecd level. the labor administration funds labour market training for unemployed job seekers, the training for unemployed job seeker can last up to 6 months, which is often vocational. the aim of the training is to improve the channels of finding employment.
the american economist and "the new york times" columnist paul krugman has suggested that the short term costs of euro membership to the finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the european economy. krugman notes, that sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. membership of the euro protects finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the european union like finland that are highly integrated into the larger european economy. if finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the european market. in fact, business leaders in sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. although sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like denmark's currency the swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. this exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of sweden's european trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. maintaining this balance has allowed the swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. this has led sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of nokia, finlands largest company and finland's only major multinational. nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the european single market, particularly from a common european digital mobile phone standard (gsm), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. one reason for the popularity of the euro in finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when finland joined the single currency. some american economists like paul krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. these economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the american union, many of which have quite disparate economies.
finnish politicians have often emulated other nordics and the nordic model. nordic's have been free-trading and relatively welcoming to skilled migrants for over a century, though in finland immigration is a relatively new phenomenon. this is due largely to finland's less hospitable climate and the fact that the finnish language shares roots with none of the major world languages, making it more challenging than average for most to learn. the level of protection in commodity trade has been low, except for agricultural products.
as an economic environment, finland's judiciary is efficient and effective. finland is highly open to investment and free trade. finland has top levels of economic freedom in many areas, although there is a heavy tax burden and inflexible job market. finland is ranked 16th (ninth in europe) in the 2008 index of economic freedom. recently, finland has topped the patents per capita statistics, and overall productivity growth has been strong in areas such as electronics. while the manufacturing sector is thriving, oecd points out that the service sector would benefit substantially from policy improvements. the imd world competitiveness yearbook 2007 ranked finland 17th most competitive, next to germany, and lowest of the nordics. while the world economic forum report has ranked finland the most competitive country. finland is one of the most fiscally responsible eu countries.
economists attribute much growth to reforms in the product markets. according to oecd, only four eu-15 countries have less regulated product markets (uk, ireland, denmark and sweden) and only one has less regulated financial markets (denmark). nordic countries were pioneers in liberalising energy, postal, and other markets in europe. the legal system is clear and business bureaucracy less than most countries. for instance, starting a business takes an average of 14 days, compared to the world average of 43 days and denmark's average of 6 days. property rights are well protected and contractual agreements are strictly honored. finland is rated one of the least corrupted countries in corruption perceptions index. finland is rated 13th in the ease of doing business index. it indicates exceptional ease to trade across borders (5th), enforce contracts (7th), and close a business (5th), and exceptional hardship to employ workers (127th) and pay taxes (83rd).
according to the oecd, finland's job market is the least flexible of the nordic countries. finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. in contrast, during the 1990s, denmark liberalised its job market, sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually as part of a comprehensive income policy agreement. those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.
tax is collected mainly from municipal income tax, state income tax, state value added tax, customs fees, corporate taxes and special taxes. there are also property taxes, but municipal income tax pays most of municipal expenses. taxation is conducted by a state agency, verohallitus, which collects income taxes from each paycheck, and then pays the difference between tax liability and taxes paid as tax rebate or collects as tax arrears afterward. municipal income tax is a flat tax of nominally 15-20%, with deductions applied, and directly funds the municipality (a city or rural locality). the state income tax is a progressive tax; low-income individuals do not necessarily pay any. the state transfers some of its income as state support to municipalities, particularly the poorer ones. additionally, the state churches - finnish evangelical lutheran church and finnish orthodox church - are integrated to the taxation system in order to tax their members.
the middle income worker's tax wedge is 46% and effective marginal tax rates are very high. value-added tax is 24% for most items. capital gains tax is 30-34% and corporate tax is 20%, about the eu median. property taxes are low, but there is a transfer tax (1.6% for apartments or 4% for individual houses) for home buyers. there are high excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco, automobiles and motorcycles, motor fuels, lotteries, sweets and insurances. for instance, mckinsey estimates that a worker has to pay around 1600 euro for another's 400 euro service - restricting service supply and demand - though some taxation is avoided in the black market and self-service culture. another study by karlson, johansson & johnsson estimates that the percentage of the buyer’s income entering the service vendor’s wallet (inverted tax wedge) is slightly over 15%, compared to 10% in belgium, 25% in france, 40% in switzerland and 50% in the united states. tax cuts have been in every post-depression government's agenda and the overall tax burden is now around 43% of gdp compared to 51.1% in sweden, 34.7% in germany, 33.5% in canada, and 30.5% in ireland.
state and municipal politicians have struggled to cut their consumption, which is very high at 51.7% of gdp compared to 56.6% in sweden, 46.9 in germany, 39.3 in canada, and 33.5% in ireland. much of the taxes are spent on public sector employees, many of which are jobs-for-life and amount to 124,000 state employees and 430,000 municipal employees. that is 113 per 1000 residents (over a quarter of workforce) compared to 74 in the us, 70 in germany, and 42 in japan (8% of workforce). the economist intelligence unit's ranking for finland's e-readiness is high at 13th, compared to 1st for united states, 3rd for sweden, 5th for denmark, and 14th for germany. also, early and generous retirement schemes have contributed to high pension costs. social spending such as health or education is around oecd median. social transfers are also around oecd median. in 2001 finland's outsourced proportion of spending was below sweden's and above most other western european countries. finland's health care is more bureaucrat-managed than in most western european countries, though many use private insurance or cash to enjoy private clinics. some reforms toward more equal marketplace have been made in 2007-2008. in education, child nurseries, and elderly nurseries private competition is bottom-ranking compared to sweden and most other western countries. some public monopolies such alko remain, and are sometimes challenged by the european union. the state has a programme where the number of jobs decreases by attrition: for two retirees, only one new employee is hired.
finland's export-dependent economy continuously adapted to the world market; in doing so, it changed finnish society as well. the prolonged worldwide boom, beginning in the late 1940s and lasting until the first oil crisis in 1973, was a challenge that finland met and from which it emerged with a highly sophisticated and diversified economy, including a new occupational structure. some sectors kept a fairly constant share of the work force. transportation and construction, for example, each accounted for between 7 and 8 percent in both 1950 and 1985, and manufacturing's share rose only from 22 to 24 percent. however, both the commercial and the service sectors more than doubled their share of the work force, accounting, respectively, for 21 and 28 percent in 1985. the greatest change was the decline of the economically active population employed in agriculture and forestry, from approximately 50 percent in 1950 to 10 percent in 1985. the exodus from farms and forests provided the labour power needed for the growth of other sectors.
studies of finnish mobility patterns since world war ii have confirmed the significance of this exodus. sociologists have found that people with a farming background were present in other occupations to a considerably greater extent in finland than in other west european countries. finnish data for the early 1980s showed that 30 to 40 percent of those in occupations not requiring much education were the children of farmers, as were about 25 percent in upper-level occupations, a rate two to three times that of france and noticeably higher than that even of neighboring sweden. finland also differed from the other nordic countries in that the generational transition from the rural occupations to white-collar positions was more likely to be direct, bypassing manual occupations.
the most important factor determining social mobility in finland was education. children who attained a higher level of education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. a tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. in addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.
the economic transformation also altered income structure. a noticeable shift was the reduction in wage differentials. the increased wealth produced by an advanced economy was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad income agreements that evolved in the postwar era. organized sectors of the economy received wage hikes even greater than the economy's growth rate. as a result, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the pay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle class declined in relation to that of other groups.
the long trend of growth in living standards paired with diminishing differences between social classes was dramatically reversed during the 1990s. for the first time in the history of finland income differences have sharply grown. this change has been mostly driven by the growth of income from capital to the wealthiest segment of the population.

finland has excellent communications, and is considered one of the most advanced information societies in the world.
telephones – main lines in use: 2.368 million (2004)
telephones – mobile cellular: 4.988 million (2004)
telephone system: general assessment: modern system with excellent seice.
domestic: digital fiber-optic fixed-line network and an extensive cellular network provide domestic needs. there are three major cellular network providers with independent networks (elisa oyj, telia finland and dna oyj). there are several smaller providers which may have independent networks in smaller areas, but are generally dependent on rented networks. there is a great variety of cellular providers and contracts, and competition is particularly fierce.
international: country code – 358; 2 submarine cable (finland-estonia and finland-sweden connection); satellite earth stations – access to intelsat transmission service via a swedish satellite earth station, 1 inmarsat (atlantic and indian ocean regions); note – finland shares the inmarsat earth station with the other nordic countries (denmark, iceland, norway, and sweden).
there is a national public radio and television company yleisradio (yle), which is funded by television license fees, and two major private media companies, alma media and sanoma, with national tv channels. yle maintains four tv channels yle1, yle2, teema and fst5. there are four commercial, national channels: alma media has mtv3 and subtv, and sanoma has nelonen and jim. there are also a lot of pay-tv channels. news corporation introduced itself to the market in 2012 with the fox channel, which was preceded by finnish-owned suomitv.

in 2011, there were over 3.5 million broadband subscriptions in finland, and the number of both them and mobile data transmission subscriptions continued to grow.

the transport system of finland is well-developed. factors affecting traffic include the sparse population and long distance between towns and cities, and the cold climate with waterways freezing and land covered in snow for winter.
the extensive road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. , the country's network of main roads has a total length of around and all public roads . the motorway network totals with additional reserved only for motor traffic. road network expenditure of around 1 billion euro is paid with vehicle and fuel taxes that amount to around 1.5 billion euro and 1 billion euro.
the main international passenger gateway is helsinki-vantaa airport with over 20 million passengers in 2018. about 25 airports have scheduled passenger services. they are financed by competitive fees and rural airport may be subsidized. the helsinki-vantaa based finnair (known for an asia-focused strategy), nordic regional airlines provide air services both domestically and internationally. helsinki has an optimal location for great circle routes between western europe and the far east. hence, many international travelers visit helsinki on a stop-over between asia and europe.
despite low population density, taxpayers spend annually around 350 million euro in maintaining railway tracks even to many rural towns. operations are privatized and currently the only operator is the state-owned vr. it has 5 percent passenger market share (out of which 80 percent are urban trips in greater helsinki) and 25 percent cargo market share. helsinki has an urban rail network.
icebreakers keep the 23 ports open all year round. there is passenger traffic from helsinki and turku, which have ferry connections to tallinn, mariehamn, sweden and several other destinations.
road transport in finland is the most popular method of transportation, particularly in rural areas where the railway network does not extend to. there are of public roads, of which are paved. the main road network comprises over of road.
64% of all traffic on public roads takes place on main roads, which are divided into class i ("/") and class ii ("/") main roads. motorways have been constructed in the country since the 1960s, but they are still reasonably rare because traffic volumes are not large enough to motivate their construction. there are of motorways. longest stretches are helsinki–turku (main road 1/e18), helsinki–tampere (main road 3/e12), helsinki–heinola (main road 4/e75), and helsinki–hamina (main road 7/e18). the world's northernmost motorway is also located in finland between keminmaa and tornio (main road 29/e8).
there are no toll roads in finland.
speed limits change depending on the time of the year; the maximum speed limit on motorways is in the summer and in the winter. the main roads usually have speed limits of either 100 km/h or . speed limits in urban areas range between and . if no other speed limit is signposted, the general speed limit in finland is in built-up areas and outside.
, there are 4,95 million registered automobiles, of which 2,58 million cars. average age of cars (museum cars excluded) is over ten years, and typically the cars are destroyed in age of 24 years. in 2015, ca. 123 000 new vehicles were registered in finland. about 550,000–600,000 used automobiles are sold each year in finland. during 2011–2014 the most sold car brand was volkswagen. it had a market share of 12% of new cars.
coaches are mainly operated by private companies and provide services widely across the country. there is a large network of expressbus services with connections to all major cities and the most important rural areas as well as a burgeoning onnibus 'cheap bus' network. coach stations are operated by matkahuolto.
local bus services inside cities and towns have often been tightly regulated by the councils. many councils also have their own bus operators, such as tampere city transit (tkl), which operates some bus lines on a commercial basis in competition with privately owned providers. regional bus lines have been regulated by the provincial administration to protect old transit companies, leading to cartel situations like tlo in the turku region, but strong regional regulating bodies, like the helsinki regional transport authority (hsl/hrt), whose routes are put out to tender exist as well and will become the norm after the transitional period during the 2010s.
in 2015, number of road traffic accidents involving personal injury was 5,164. in them, 266 persons were killed. the number of road deaths per million inhabitants is just below the european average. traffic safety has improved significantly since the early 1970s, when more than one thousand people died in road traffic every year.
municipal law 30-31 § gives right to referendum since year 1990. citizens of turku collected 15,000 names in one month for referendum against the underground car park. politicians with in the elections unknown financing from the parking company neglected the citizens opinion. according to international association of public transport uitp parking places are the among the most effective ways to promote private car use in the city. therefore, many european cities have cancelled the expensive underground car parking after the 1990s. the eu recommended actions cover develop guidance for concrete measures for the internalisation of external costs for car traffic also in urban areas. in finland the shops routinely offer free parking for private cars.
the finnish railway network consists of a total of of railways built with . of track is electrified. in 2010, passengers made 13.4 million long distance voyages and 55.5 million trips in local traffic. on the same year, over of freight were transported.
passenger trains are operated by the state-owned vr. they serve all the major cities and many rural areas, complemented by bus connections where needed. most passenger train services originate or terminate at helsinki central railway station, and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of helsinki. high-speed pendolino services are operated from helsinki to other major cities like jyväskylä, joensuu, kuopio, oulu, tampere and turku. modern intercity services complement the pendolino network, and cheaper and older long and short distance trains operate in areas with fewer passengers.
the helsinki area has three urban rail systems: a tramway, a metro, and a commuter rail system. light rail systems are currently being planned for helsinki and also for turku and tampere, two of the country's other major urban centres.
there are plans to link helsinki to turku and tampere by high-speed lines resulting in journey times of an hour between the capital and the two cities. a link to kouvola is also planned. the estimated cost of these lines is €10 billion.
in finland there have been three cities with trams: helsinki, turku and viipuri. only helsinki has retained its tramway network. the trams in viipuri, having been lost to soviet union in 1945, ceased operations in 1957, while the turku tramway network shut down in 1972.
in november 2016, tampere city council approved the construction of a new light rail system. construction of phase 1 begun late 2016 and is scheduled to finish in 2021. turku also has preliminary plans for new tram system, but no decision to build it has been made.
helsinki currently operates 13 tramlines on a network of approximately of track in passenger service. the trams have annually 57 million passengers.
there are 148 airfields, 74 of which have paved runways. 21 airports are served by scheduled passenger flights. by far the largest airport is helsinki-vantaa airport, and the second largest by passenger volume is oulu airport. the larger airports are managed by the state-owned finavia (formerly the finnish civil aviation administration). finnair, nordic regional airlines and norwegian air shuttle are the main carriers for domestic flights.
helsinki-vantaa airport is finland's global gateway with scheduled non-stop flights to such places as bangkok, beijing, guangzhou, nagoya, new york, osaka, shanghai, hong kong and tokyo. helsinki has an optimal location for great circle airline traffic routes between western europe and the far east. the airport is located approximately 19 kilometers north of helsinki's downtown in the city of vantaa, thus the name helsinki-vantaa.
other airports with regular scheduled international connections are kokkola-pietarsaari airport, mariehamn airport, tampere-pirkkala airport, turku airport and vaasa airport.
the finnish maritime administration is responsible for the maintenance of finland's waterway network. finland's waterways includes some of coastal fairways and of finland waterways (on rivers, canals, and lakes). saimaa canal connects lake saimaa, and thus much of the inland waterway system of finland, with the baltic sea at vyborg (viipuri). however, the lower part of the canal is currently located in russia. to facilitate through shipping, finland leases the russian section of the canal from russia (the original agreement with the soviet union dates to 1963).
the largest general port is port of hamina-kotka. port of helsinki is the busiest passenger harbour, and it also has significant cargo traffic. by cargo tons, the five busiest ports are haminakotka, helsinki, rauma, kilpilahti and naantali.
icebreakers keep 23 ports open for traffic even in winter. the ports in gulf of bothnia need icebreakers in average six months a year, while in gulf of finland icebreakers are needed for three months a year.
frequent ferry service connects finland with estonia and sweden. baltic cruise liners regularly call on the
port of helsinki as well. in domestic service, ferries connect finland's islands with the mainland. finland's cargo ports
move freight both for finland's own needs and for transshipment to russia.

the finnish defence forces (, ) are responsible for the defence of finland. a universal male conscription is in place, under which all men above 18 years of age serve for 165, 255, or 347 days. alternative non-military service for all men, and volunteer service for all women are possible.
finland is the only non-nato european union state bordering russia. finland's official policy states that a wartime military strength of 280,000 personnel constitutes a sufficient deterrent. the army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. the army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier.
finland's defence budget equals approximately €3.1 billion or 1.3% of gdp. the voluntary overseas service is highly popular and troops serve around the world in un, nato and eu missions. homeland defence willingness against a superior enemy is at 76%, one of the highest rates in europe.
in war time the finnish border guard (which is its own military unit in peacetime) will become part of the finnish defence forces.
after finland's declaration of independence on 6 december 1917, the civic guards were proclaimed the troops of the government on 25 january 1918 and c.g.e mannerheim was appointed as commander-in-chief of these forces the next day. fighting between the white guards (as the civic guards were commonly known) and the red guards had already broken out about a week before around viipuri, in what became known as the finnish civil war.
in the war, the whites were victorious in large part thanks to the leadership of mannerheim and the lead by example offensive mindedness of 1,800 german-trained finnish jägers, who brought with them german tactical doctrine and military culture. the post-war years were characterized by the volunteer campaigns that came to an end in 1920 with the signing of the treaty of tartu, which ended the state of war between finland and soviet russia and defined the internationally recognized borders of finland.
after winning the civil war, the finnish peacetime army was organized as three divisions and a brigade by professional german officers. it became the basic structure for the next 20 years. the coast was guarded by former czarist coastal fortifications and ships taken as prizes of war. the air force had already been formed in march 1918, but remained a part of the army and did not become a fully independent fighting force until 1928.
the new government instituted conscription after the civil war and also introduced a mobilization system and compulsory refresher courses for reservists. an academy providing basic officer training ("kadettikoulu") was established in 1919, the founding of a general staff college ("sotakorkeakoulu") followed in 1924, and in 1927 a tactical training school ("taistelukoulu") for company-grade and junior officers and ncos was set up. the requirement of one year of compulsory service was greater than that imposed by any other scandinavian country in the 1920s and the 1930s, but political opposition to defense spending left the military badly equipped to resist an attack by the soviet union, the only security threat in finnish eyes.
when the soviets invaded in november 1939, the finns defeated the red army on numerous occasions, including at the crucial battle of suomussalmi. these successes were in large part thanks to the application of motti tactics. while the finns ultimately lost the war and were forced to agree to the moscow peace treaty, the soviet objective of conquering finland failed, in part due to the threat of allied intervention. during the war the finns lost 25,904 men, while soviet losses were 167,976 dead.
finland fought in the continuation war alongside germany from 1941 to 1944. thanks to german aid, the army was now much better equipped, and the period of conscription had been increased to two years, making possible the formation of sixteen infantry divisions. having initially deployed on the defensive, the finns took advantage of the weakening of the soviet positions as a consequence of operation barbarossa, swiftly recovering their lost territories and invading soviet territory in karelia, eventually settling into defensive positions from december 1941 onwards. the soviet offensive of june 1944 undid these finnish gains and, while failing in its objective of destroying the finnish army and forcing finland's unconditional surrender, forced finland out of the war. the finnish were able to preserve their independence with key defensive victories over the red army. the battle of tali-ihantala being very significant.
the demobilization and regrouping of the finnish defence forces were carried out in late 1944 under the supervision of the soviet-dominated allied control commission. following the treaty of paris in 1947, which imposed restrictions on the size and equipment of the armed forces and required disbandment of the civic guard, finland reorganized its defense forces. the fact that the conditions of the peace treaty did not include prohibitions on reserves or mobilization made it possible to contemplate an adequate defense establishment within the prescribed limits. the reorganization resulted in the adoption of the brigade -in place of the division- as the standard formation.
for the first two decades after the second world war, the finnish defence forces relied largely on obsolete wartime material. defence spending remained minimal until the early 1960s. during the peak of the cold war, the finnish government made a conscious effort to increase defence capability. this resulted in the commissioning of several new weapons systems and the strengthening of the defence of finnish lapland by the establishment of new garrisons in the area. from 1968 onwards, the finnish government adopted the doctrine of territorial defence, which requires the use of large land areas to delay and wear out a potential aggressor. the doctrine was complemented by the concept of total defence which calls for the use of all resources of society for national defence in case of a crisis. from the mid-1960s onwards the finnish defence forces also began to specifically prepare to defeat a strategic strike, the kind which the soviet union employed successfully to topple the government of czechoslovakia in 1968. in an all-out confrontation between the two major blocs, finnish objective would have been to prevent any military incursions to finnish territory and thereby keep finland outside the war.
the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 did not annihilate the military threat perceived by the government, but the nature of the threat has changed. while the concept of total, territorial defence was not dropped, the military planning has moved towards the capability to prevent and frustrate a strategic attack toward the vital regions of the country.
the finnish defence forces are under the command of the chief of defence, who is directly subordinate to the president of the republic in matters related to the military command. decisions concerning military orders are made by the president of the republic in consultation with the prime minister and the minister of defence.
apart from the defence command (, ), the military branches are the finnish army (, ), the finnish navy (, ) and the finnish air force (, ). the border guard (, ) (including the coast guard) is under the authority of the ministry of the interior, but can be incorporated fully or in part into the defence forces when required by defence readiness. all logistical duties of the defence forces are carried out by the defence forces logistics command (), which has three logistics regiment for each military province.
the army is divided into eight brigade-level units (). under the brigades, there were 12 military districts (), which were responsible for carrying out the draft, training and crisis-time activation of reservists and for planning and executing territorial defence of their areas. the military districts were disbanded in 2014, as a part of the 800 million euro savings the finnish defence forces had to carry out.
the navy consists of headquarters and four brigade-level units: coastal fleet (), coastal brigade (), nyland brigade (, ), and naval academy (). the coastal fleet includes all the surface combatants of the navy, while coastal brigade and nyland brigade train coastal troops.
the air force consists of headquarters and four brigade-level units: satakunta, lapland and karelian air commands () and air force academy (). they are responsible for securing the integrity of the finnish airspace during peace and for conducting aerial warfare independently during a crisis.
the military training of the reservists is primarily the duty of the defence forces, but it is assisted by the national defence training association of finland (). this association provides reservists with personal, squad, platoon and company level military training. most of the 2,000 instructors of the association are volunteers certified by the defence forces, but when defence forces materiel is used, the training always takes place under the supervision of career military personnel. annually, the defence forces requests the association to run specialized exercises for some 8,500 personnel placed in reserve units, and an additional 16,500 reservists participate in military courses where the participants are not directly selected by the defence forces. the legislation concerning the association will require that the chairman and the majority of the members of its board are chosen by the finnish government. the other board members are chosen by ngos active in the national defence.
the finnish defence forces is based on universal male conscription. all men above 18 years of age are liable to serve either 6, 9 or 12 months. some 27,000 conscripts are trained annually. 80% of finnish men complete their service. the conscripts at first receive basic training, after which they are assigned to various units for special training. privates who are trained for tasks not requiring special skills serve for 6 months. in technically demanding tasks the time of service is 9, or in some cases 12 months. those selected for nco (non-commissioned officer) or officer training serve 12 months. at the completion of the service, the conscripts receive a reserve military rank of private, lance corporal, corporal, sergeant or second lieutenant, depending on their training and accomplishments. after their military service, the conscripts are placed in reserve until the end of their 50th or 60th living year, depending on their military rank. during their time in reserve, the reservists are liable to participate in military refresher exercises for a total of 40, 75 or 100 days, depending on their military rank. in addition, all reservists are liable for activation in a situation where the military threat against finland has seriously increased, in full or partial mobilization or in a large-scale disaster or a virulent epidemic. the males who do not belong to the reserve may only be activated in case of full mobilization, and those rank-and-file personnel who have fulfilled 50 years of age only with a specific parliamentary decision.
military service can be started after turning 18. the service can be delayed due to studies, work or other personal reasons until the 28th birthday, but these reasons do not result in exemptions. in addition to lodging, food, clothes and health care the conscripts receive between 5 and 11.70 euros per day, depending on the time they have served. the state also pays for any rental and electricity bills the conscripts incur during their service. if the conscripts have families, they are entitled to benefits as well. it is illegal to fire an employee due to military service or due to a refresher exercise or activation. voluntary females in military service receive a small additional benefit, because they are expected to provide their own underwear and other personal items.
the military service consists of lessons, practical training, various cleaning and maintenance duties and field exercises. most weekends conscripts can leave the barracks on friday and are expected to return by midnight on sunday. a small force of conscripts are kept in readiness on weekends to aid civil agencies in various types of emergency situations, to guard the premises and to maintain defence in case of a sudden military emergency. field exercises can go on regardless of the time of day or week.
the training of conscripts is based on "joukkotuotanto"-principle (lit. english "troop production"). in this system, 80% of the conscripts are trained to fulfill a specific role in a specific wartime military unit. each brigade-level unit is responsible for producing specified reserve units from the conscripts it has been allocated. as the reservists are discharged, they receive a specific wartime placement in the unit with which they have trained during their conscription. as the conscripts age, their unit is given new, different tasks and materiel. typically, reservists are placed for the first five years in first-line units, then moved to military formations with less demanding tasks, while the reservists unable to serve in the unit are substituted with reservists from the reserve without specific placement. in refresher exercises, the unit is then given new training for these duties, if the defence funding permits this.
the inhabitants of the demilitarized åland islands are exempt from military service. by the conscription act of 1950, they are however required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard instead. however, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. the non-military service of åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. the inhabitants of åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. also exempt from military service are the jehovah's witnesses. it is also possible to serve either weapon-free military service of 270 or 362 days or undergo a 12-month-long non-military service. finnish law requires that men who do not want to serve the defense of the country in any capacity (so-called total objectors) be sentenced to a prison term of 197 days. as of 1995, women were permitted to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers as officers. in conscription, women have consideration time of six weeks, during which they have the choice to halt their service without any other specific reason. after the said six weeks, all the same laws and jurisdictions apply to them as to men. unlike in many other countries women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.
the finnish military ranks follow the western usage in the officer ranks. as a finnish peculiarity, the rank of lieutenant has three grades: 2nd lieutenant, lieutenant and senior lieutenant. the 2nd lieutenant is a reserve officer rank, active commissioned officers beginning their service as lieutenants.
the basic structure of the nco ranks is a variant of the german rank structure, but the rank system has some peculiarities due to different personnel groups. the duties carried out by ncos in most western armed forces are carried out by
in a case of war, most of the nco duties would be carried out by reserve ncos who have received their training during conscription.
the rank and file of the finnish defence forces is composed of conscripts serving in the ranks of private, lance corporal and nco student.
finland does not have attack helicopters, submarines, long-range ballistic missiles (finland has however updated its m270 mlrss capable to shoot atacms tactical ballistic missiles). legislation forbids nuclear weapons entirely.
finland has taken part in peacekeeping operations since 1956 (the number of finnish peacekeepers who have served since 1956 amounts to 43,000). in 2003 over a thousand finnish peacekeepers were involved in peacekeeping operations, including un and nato led missions. according to the finnish law the maximum simultaneous strength of the peacekeeping forces is limited to 2,000 soldiers.
since 1956, 39 finnish soldiers have died while serving in peacekeeping operations
since 1996 the pori brigade has trained parts of the finnish rapid deployment force (frdf), which can take part in international crisis management/peacekeeping operations at short notice. the nyland/uusimaa brigade has started training the amphibious task unit (atu) in recent years, a joint swedish-finnish international task unit.
since 2006, finland has participated in the formation of european union battlegroups. finland will be participating to two european union battlegroups in 2011.
international operations finland is participating in by deploying military units (personnel strength in parenthesis):
other international operations finland is participating in with staff personnel, military observers and similar (personnel strength in parenthesis):
the finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence. the term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning. in principle, each ministry has the responsibility for planning its operations during a crisis. there are no special emergency authorities, such as the u.s. federal emergency management agency (fema) or russian ministry of emergency situations. instead, each authority regularly trains for crises and has been allocated a combination of normal and emergency powers it needs to keep functioning in any conceivable situation. in a war, all resources of society may be diverted to ensure the survival of the nation. the legal basis for such measures is found in the readiness act and in the state of defence act, which would come into force through a presidential decision verified by parliament in the case of a crisis.
the main objective of the doctrine is to establish and maintain a military force capable of deterring any potential aggressor from using finnish territory or applying military pressure against finland. to accomplish this, the defence is organised on the doctrine of territorial defence. the stated main principles of the territorial defence doctrine are
the defence planning is organised to counteract three threat situations:
in all cases, the national objective is to keep the vital areas, especially the capital area in finnish possession. in other areas, the size of the country is used to delay and wear down the invader, until the enemy may be defeated in an area of finnish choosing. the army carries most of the responsibility for this task.
the key wartime army units in 2015 are:
the total number of territorial and regional units is undisclosed.
the army units are mostly composed of reservists, the career soldiers manning the command and specialty positions.
the role of the navy is to repel all attacks carried out against finnish coasts and to safeguard the territorial integrity during peacetime and the "gray" phase of the conflict. the maritime defence relies on combined use of coastal artillery, missile systems and naval mines to wear down the attacker. the air force is used to deny the invader the air superiority and to protect most important troops and objects of national importance in conjunction with the ground-based air defence. as the readiness of the air force and the navy is high even during the peacetime, the career personnel have a much more visible role in the wartime duties of these defence branches.
the border guard has the responsibility for border security in all situations. during a war, it will contribute to the national defence partially integrated into the army, its total mobilized strength being some 11,600 troops. one of the projected uses for the border guard is guerrilla warfare in areas temporarily occupied by enemy.
the army is organised into operative forces which consist of approximately 61 000 men and territorial forces which consist of 176 000 men. the following list is the wartime organisation of the finnish army from 1.1.2008

the foreign relations of finland are the responsibility of the president of finland, who leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government. implicitly the government is responsible for internal policy and decision making in the european union. within the government, preparative discussions are conducted in the government committee of foreign and security policy ("ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta"), which includes the prime minister and at least the minister of foreign affairs and the minister of defence, and at most four other ministers as necessary. the committee meets with the president as necessary. laws concerning foreign relations are discussed in the parliamentary committee of foreign relations ("ulkoasiainvaliokunta, utrikesutskottet"). the ministry of foreign affairs implements the foreign policy.
during the cold war, finland's foreign policy was based on official neutrality between the western powers and the soviet union, while simultaneously stressing nordic cooperation in the framework of the nordic council and cautious economic integration with the west as promoted by the bretton-woods agreement and the free trade treaty with the european economic community. finland shares this history with close neighbour sweden, which finland was a part of until the split of the swedish empire in 1809. finland did not join the soviet union's economic sphere (comecon) but remained a free-market economy and conducted bilateral trade with the soviet union. after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991, finland unilaterally abrogated the last restrictions imposed on it by the paris peace treaties of 1947 and the finno-soviet agreement of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance. the government filed an application for membership in the european union (eu) three months after the dissolution of the soviet union and became a member in 1995. finland did not attempt to join nato, even though post-soviet countries on the baltic sea and elsewhere joined. nevertheless, defence policymakers have quietly converted to nato equipment and contributed troops.
president martti ahtisaari and the coalition governments led finland closer to the core eu in the late 1990s. finland was considered a cooperative model state, and finland did not oppose proposals for a common eu defence policy. this was reversed in the 2000s, when tarja halonen and erkki tuomioja made finland's official policy to resist other eu members' plans for common defense. however, halonen allowed finland to join european union battlegroups in 2006 and the nato response force in 2008.
relations with russia are cordial and common issues include bureaucracy (particularly at the vaalimaa border crossing), airspace violations, development aid finland gives to russia (especially in environmental problems that affect finland), and finland's energy dependency on russian gas and electricity. behind the scenes, the administration has witnessed a resurrection of soviet-era tactics. the national security agency, finnish security intelligence service, estimates that the known number of russian agents from foreign intelligence service (svr) and gru now exceeds cold war levels and there are unknown numbers of others.
as of march 2011 finland maintains diplomatic relations with all un member states.
after independence from russia in 1917, the finnish civil war, including interventions by imperial germany and soviet russia, and failure of the communist revolution, resulted in the official ban on communism, and strengthening relations with western countries. overt alliance with germany was not possible due to the result of the first world war, but in general the period of 1918 to 1939 was characterised by economic growth and increasing integration to the western world economy. relations with soviet russia from 1918 to 1939 were icy; voluntary expeditions to russia called heimosodat ended only in 1922, four years after the conclusion of the finnish civil war. however, attempts to establish military alliances were unsuccessful. thus, when the winter war broke out, finland was left alone to resist the soviet attack. later, during the continuation war, finland declared "co-belligerency" with nazi germany, and allowed northern finland to be used as a german attack base. the peace settlement in 1944 with the soviet union led to the lapland war in 1945, where finland fought germans in northern finland.
from the end of the continuation war with the soviet union in 1944 until 1991, the policy was to avoid superpower conflicts and to build mutual confidence with the western powers and the soviet union. although the country was culturally, socially, and politically western, finns realised they had to live in peace with the ussr and take no action that might be interpreted as a security threat. the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 opened up dramatic new possibilities for finland and has resulted in the finns actively seeking greater participation in western political and economic structures. the popular support for the strictly self-defensive doctrine remains.
in the 2000 constitution, where diverse constitutional laws were unified into one statute, the leading role of the president was slightly moderated. however, because the constitution still stipulates only that the president leads foreign policy and the government internal policy, the responsibility over european union affairs is not explicitly resolved. implicitly this belongs to the powers of the government. in a cohabitation situation as with matti vanhanen's recent second government right-wing government and left-wing president tarja halonen, there can be friction between government ministers and the president.
the arrangement has been criticised by risto e. j. penttilä for not providing a simple answer of who's in charge.
finnish foreign policy emphasises its participation in multilateral organisations. finland joined the united nations in 1955 and the european union in 1995. as noted, the country also is a member of nato's partnership for peace as well as an observer in the euro-atlantic partnership council. the military has been prepared to be more compatible with nato, as co-operation with nato in peacekeeping is needed, but military alliance does not have popular support.
in the european union, finland is a member of the eurozone, and in addition, the schengen treaty abolishing passport controls. 60% of foreign trade is to the eu. other large trade partners are russia and the united states.
finland is well represented in the un civil service in proportion to its population and belongs to several of its specialised and related agencies. finnish troops have participated in united nations peacekeeping activities since 1956, and the finns continue to be one of the largest per capita contributors of peacekeepers in the world. finland is an active participant in the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) and in early 1995 assumed the co-chairmanship of the osce's minsk group on the nagorno-karabakh conflict.
cooperation with the other scandinavian countries also is important to finland, and it has been a member of the nordic council since 1955. under the council's auspices, the nordic countries have created a common labor market and have abolished immigration controls among themselves. the council also serves to coordinate social and cultural policies of the participating countries and has promoted increased cooperation in many fields.
in addition to the organisations already mentioned, finland is a member of the international bank for reconstruction and development, the international monetary fund, the world trade organization, the international finance corporation, the international development association, the bank for international settlements, the asian development bank, the inter-american development bank, the council of europe, and the organisation for economic co-operation and development.
following the dissolution of the soviet union, finland has moved steadily towards integration into western institutions and abandoned its formal policy of neutrality, which has been recast as a policy of military nonalliance coupled with the maintenance of a credible, independent defence. finland's 1994 decision to buy 64 f-18 hornet fighter planes from the united states signalled the abandonment of the country's policy of balanced arms purchases from communist countries and western countries.
in 1994, finland joined nato's partnership for peace; the country is also an observer in the north atlantic cooperation council. finland became a full member of the eu in january 1995, at the same time acquiring observer status in the eu's defence arm, the western european union.
generally, finland has abided by the principle of neutrality and has good relations with nearly all countries, as evidenced by the freedom of travel that a finnish passport gives.
finland has established diplomatic relations with all united nations member states, plus the holy see and kosovo.

telecommunications in france is highly developed. france is served by an extensive system of automatic telephone exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular telephone service is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries.
the telephony system employs an extensive system of modern network elements such as digital telephone exchanges, mobile switching centres, media gateways and signalling gateways at the core, interconnected by a wide variety of transmission systems using fibre-optics or microwave radio relay networks. the access network, which connects the subscriber to the core, is highly diversified with different copper-pair, optic-fibre and wireless technologies. the fixed-line telecommunications market is dominated by the former state-owned monopoly france telecom.
telephones - main lines in use: 36.441 million; 35.5 million (metropolitan france) (2009)
telephones - mobile cellular: 60.95 million; 59.543 million (metropolitan france) (2009)
satellite earth stations - 2 intelsat (with total of 5 antennas - 2 for indian ocean and 3 for atlantic ocean), na eutelsat, 1 inmarsat (atlantic ocean region); hf radiotelephone communications with more than 20 countries
radio broadcast stations: am 41, fm about 3,500 (this figure is an approximation and includes many repeaters), shortwave 2 (1998)
radios: 55.3 million (1997)
television broadcast stations: 584 (plus 9,676 repeaters) (1995)
televisions: 34.8 million (1997)
internet country code: .fr
internet service providers (isps): 62 (2000)
internet hosts: 15,182,001; 15.161 million (metropolitan france) (2010)
internet users: 45.262 million; 44.625 million (metropolitan france) (2009)
france currently has 4 mobile networks, orange, sfr, bouygues telecom and free all of which are licensed for gsm and umts. in 2016 q3, orange had 28.966 million mobile phone customers, sfr had 14.577 million, bouygues had 12.660 million, free mobile had 12.385 million, and the mvnos had 7.281 million.
before the launch of free mobile in january 2012, the number of physical mobile phone operators was very limited. for example, sweden currently has 4 licensed operators with their own networks despite a smaller and sparser population than france's, making improved coverage less economically rewarding. however, france has a number of mvnos which increases competition.
however, free mobile obtained its licence in december 2009 and operates since january 2012.
in france, the satellite telecommunications system telecom 1 (tc1) will provide high-speed, broadband transfer of digital data between different sections of subscribing companies. conventional telecommunications links between continental france and its overseas departments will also be supplied.

transportation in france relies on one of the densest networks in the world with 146 km of road and 6.2 km of rail lines per 100 km. it is built as a web with paris at its center. rail, road, air and water are all widely developed forms of transportation in france.
the first important human improvements were the roman roads linking major settlements and providing quick passage for marching armies.
all through the middle ages improvements were few and second rate. transport became slow and awkward to use. the early modern period saw great improvements. there was a very quick production of canals connecting rivers. it also saw great changes in oceanic shipping. rather than expensive galleys, wind powered ships that were much faster and had more room for cargo became popular for coastal trade. transatlantic shipping with the new world turned cities such as nantes, bordeaux, cherbourg-octeville and le havre into major ports.
there is a total of of railway in france, mostly operated by sncf (société nationale des chemins de fer français), the french national railway company. like the road system, the french railways are subsidised by the state, receiving €13.2 billion in 2013. the railway system is a small portion of total travel, accounting for less than 10% of passenger travel.
from 1981 onwards, a newly constructed set of high-speed "lignes à grande vitesse" (lgv) lines linked france's most populous areas with the capital, starting with paris-lyon. in 1994, the channel tunnel opened, connecting france and great britain by rail under the english channel. the tgv has set many world speed records, the most recent on 3 april 2007, when a new version of the tgv dubbed the v150 with larger wheels than the usual tgv, and a stronger engine, broke the world speed record for conventional rail trains, reaching 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph).
trains, unlike road traffic, drive on the left (except in alsace-moselle). metro and tramway services are not thought of as trains and usually follow road traffic in driving on the right (except the lyon metro).
six cities in france currently have a rapid transit service (frequently known as a 'metro'). full metro systems are in operation in paris (16 lines), lyon (4 lines) and marseille (2 lines). light metro (val-type) systems are in use in lille (2 lines), toulouse (2 lines) and rennes (1 line).
in spite of the closure of most of france's first generation tram systems in earlier years, a fast-growing number of france's major cities have modern tram or light rail networks, including paris, lyon (lyon having the biggest one), toulouse, montpellier, saint-étienne, strasbourg and nantes. recently the tram has seen a very big revival with many experiments such as ground level power supply in bordeaux, or trolleybuses pretending to be trams in nancy.
this way of travelling started disappearing in france at the end of the 1930s. only lille, marseille and saint-étienne have never given up their tram systems. since the 1980s, several cities have re-introduced it.
the following french towns and cities run light rail or tram systems:
tram systems are planned or under construction in tours, and fort-de-france.
the revival of tram networks in france has brought about a number of technical developments both in the traction systems and in the styling of the cars:
prominent bi-articulated "tram-like" van hool vehicles (mettis) are used in metz since 2013. they work as classic trams but without needing rails and catenaries, and can transport up to 155 passengers while being ecological thanks to a diesel-electric hybrid engine.
in the starting up, batteries feed the engine of the bus, which can then roll 150 meters before the diesel engine takes over.
there are ~ of roads in france. the french motorway network or autoroute system consists largely of toll roads, except around large cities and in parts of the north. it is a network totalling of motorways operated by private companies such as sanef (société des autoroutes du nord et de l'est de la france). it has the 8th largest highway network in the world, trailing only the united states, china, russia, japan, canada, spain and germany.
france currently counts 30,500 km of major trunk roads or routes nationales and state-owned motorways. by way of comparison, the "routes départementales" cover a total distance of 365,000 km. the main trunk road network reflects the centralising tradition of france: the majority of them leave the gates of paris. indeed, trunk roads begin on the parvis of notre-dame of paris at kilometre zero. to ensure an effective road network, new roads not serving paris were created.
france is believed to be the most car-dependent country in europe. in 2005, 937 billion vehicle kilometres were travelled in france (85% by car).
in order to overcome this dependence, in france and many more countries the long distance coaches' market has been liberalised. since 2015, with the law macron, the market has exploded: the increasing demand lead to a higher supply of bus services and coach companies.
in most, if not all, french cities, urban bus services are provided at a flat-rate charge for individual journeys. many cities have bus services that operate well out into the suburbs or even the country. fares are normally cheap, but rural services can be limited, especially on weekends.
trains have long had a monopoly on inter-regional buses, but in 2015 the french government introduced reforms to allow bus operators to travel these routes.
the french natural and man-made waterways network is the largest in europe extending to over of which (vnf, ), the french navigation authority, manages the navigable sections. some of the navigable rivers include the loire, seine and rhône. the assets managed by vnf comprise of waterways, made up of of canals and of navigable rivers, 494 dams, 1595 locks, 74 navigable aqueducts, 65 reservoirs, 35 tunnels and a land area of . two significant waterways not under vnf's control are the navigable sections of the river somme and the brittany canals, which are both under local management.
approximately 20% of the network is suitable for commercial boats of over 1000 tonnes and the vnf has an ongoing programme of maintenance and modernisation to increase depth of waterways, widths of locks and headroom under bridges to support france's strategy of encouraging freight onto water.
france has an extensive merchant marine, including 55 ships of size gross register tonnage 1,000 and above. the country also maintains a captive register for french-owned ships in iles kerguelen (french southern and antarctic lands).
french companies operate over 1,400 ships of which 700 are registered in france. france's 110 shipping firms employ 12,500 personnel at sea and 15,500 on shore. each year, 305 million tonnes of goods and 15 million passengers are transported by sea. marine transport is responsible for 72% of france's imports and exports.
france also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including bayonne, bordeaux, boulogne-sur-mer, brest, calais, cherbourg-octeville, dunkerque, fos-sur-mer, la pallice, le havre, lorient, marseille, nantes, nice, paris, port-la-nouvelle, port-vendres, roscoff, rouen, saint-nazaire, saint-malo, sète, strasbourg and toulon.
there are approximately 478 airports in france (1999 est.) and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved.
among the airspace governance authorities active in france, one is aéroports de paris, which has authority over the paris region, managing 14 airports including the two busiest in france, charles de gaulle airport and orly airport. the former, located in roissy near paris, is the fifth busiest airport in the world with 60 million passenger movements in 2008, and france's primary international airport, serving over 100 airlines.
the national carrier of france is air france, a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including overseas departments and territories of france) across all 6 major continents.

the french armed forces () encompass the army, the navy, the air force, the national guard and the gendarmerie of the french republic. the president of france heads the armed forces as "chef des armées".
france maintains the fifth largest defence budget in the world and the first in the european union (eu). france has the largest armed forces in size in the european union. france also maintains the world's third-largest nuclear deterrent (behind russia and the united states).
the military history of france encompasses an immense panorama of conflicts and struggles extending for more than 2,000 years across areas including modern france, greater europe, and french territorial possessions overseas. according to the british historian niall ferguson, france has participated in 50 of the 125 major european wars fought since 1495, and in 168 battles fought since 387 bc, they have won 109, drawn 10 and lost 49: this makes france the most successful military power in european history—in terms of number of fought and won.
the gallo-roman conflict predominated from 60 bc to 50 bc, with the romans emerging victorious in the conquest of gaul by julius caesar. after the decline of the roman empire, a germanic tribe known as the franks took control of gaul by defeating competing tribes. the "land of francia," from which france gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings clovis i and charlemagne. in the middle ages, rivalries with england and the holy roman empire prompted major conflicts such as the norman conquest and the hundred years' war. with an increasingly centralized monarchy, the first standing army since roman times, and the use of artillery, france expelled the english from its territory and came out of the middle ages as the most powerful nation in europe, only to lose that status to spain following defeat in the italian wars. the wars of religion crippled france in the late 16th century, but a major victory over spain in the thirty years' war made france the most powerful nation on the continent once more. in parallel, france developed its first colonial empire in asia, africa, and in the americas. under louis xiv, france achieved military supremacy over its rivals, but escalating conflicts against increasingly powerful enemy coalitions checked french ambitions and left the kingdom bankrupt at the opening of the 18th century.
resurgent french armies secured victories in dynastic conflicts against the spanish, polish, and austrian crowns. at the same time, france was fending off attacks on its colonies. as the 18th century advanced, global competition with great britain led to the seven years' war, where france lost its north american holdings. consolation came in the form of dominance in europe and the american revolutionary war, where extensive french aid in the form of money and arms, and the direct participation of its army and navy led to america's independence. internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous conflict in the french revolutionary wars and the napoleonic wars. france reached the zenith of its power during this period, dominating the european continent in an unprecedented fashion under napoleon bonaparte, but by 1815 it had been restored to its pre-revolutionary borders. the rest of the 19th century witnessed the growth of the second french colonial empire as well as french interventions in belgium, spain, and mexico. other major wars were fought against russia in the crimea, austria in italy, and prussia within france itself.
following defeat in the franco-prussian war, franco-german rivalry erupted again in the first world war. france and its allies were victorious this time. social, political, and economic upheaval in the wake of the conflict led to the second world war, in which the allies were defeated in the battle of france and the french government surrendered and was replaced with an authoritarian regime. the allies, including the government in exile's free french forces and later a liberated french nation, eventually emerged victorious over the axis powers. as a result, france secured an occupation zone in germany and a permanent seat on the united nations security council. the imperative of avoiding a third franco-german conflict on the scale of those of two world wars paved the way for european integration starting in the 1950s. france became a nuclear power and since the 1990s its military action is most often seen in cooperation with nato and its european partners.
today, french military doctrine is based on the concepts of national independence, nuclear deterrence ("see force de frappe"), and military self-sufficiency. france is a charter member of nato, and has worked actively with its allies to adapt nato—internally and externally—to the post-cold war environment. in december 1995, france announced that it would increase its participation in nato's military wing, including the military committee (france withdrew from nato's military bodies in 1966 whilst remaining full participants in the organisation's political councils). france remains a firm supporter of the organisation for security and co-operation in europe and other cooperative efforts. paris hosted the may 1997 nato-russia summit which sought the signing of the founding act on mutual relations, cooperation and security. outside of nato, france has actively and heavily participated in both coalition and unilateral peacekeeping efforts in africa, the middle east, and the balkans, frequently taking a lead role in these operations. france has undertaken a major restructuring to develop a professional military that will be smaller, more rapidly deployable, and better tailored for operations outside of mainland france. key elements of the restructuring include: reducing personnel, bases and headquarters, and rationalistion of equipment and the armaments industry.
since the end of the cold war, france has placed a high priority on arms control and non-proliferation. french nuclear testing in the pacific, and the sinking of the "rainbow warrior" strained french relations with its allies, south pacific states (namely new zealand), and world opinion. france agreed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1992 and supported its indefinite extension in 1995. after conducting a controversial final series of six nuclear tests on mururoa in the south pacific, the french signed the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996. since then, france has implemented a moratorium on the production, export, and use of anti-personnel landmines and supports negotiations leading toward a universal ban. the french are key players in the adaptation of the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe to the new strategic environment. france remains an active participant in: the major programs to restrict the transfer of technologies that could lead to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: the nuclear suppliers group, the australia group (for chemical and biological weapons), and the missile technology control regime. france has also signed and ratified the chemical weapons convention.
on 31 july 2007, president nicolas sarkozy ordered m. jean-claude mallet, a member of the council of state, to head up a thirty-five member commission charged with a wide-ranging review of french defence. the commission issued its white paper in early 2008. acting upon its recommendations, president sarkozy began making radical changes in french defense policy and structures starting in the summer of 2008. in keeping with post-cold war changes in european politics and power structures, the french military's traditional focus on territorial defence will be redirected to meet the challenges of a global threat environment. under the reorganisation, the identification and destruction of terrorist networks both in metropolitan france and in francophone africa will be the primary task of the french military. redundant military bases will be closed and new weapons systems projects put on hold to finance the restructuring and global deployment of intervention forces. in a historic change, sarkozy furthermore has declared that france "will now participate fully in nato," four decades after former french president general charles de gaulle withdrew from the alliance's command structure and ordered american troops off french soil.
there are currently 36,000 french troops deployed in foreign territories—such operations are known as "opex" for "opérations extérieures" ("external operations"). among other countries, france provides troops for the united nations force stationed in haiti following the 2004 haiti rebellion. france has sent troops, especially special forces, into afghanistan to help the united states and nato forces fight the remains of the taliban and al qaeda. in opération licorne a force of a few thousand french soldiers is stationed in ivory coast on a un peacekeeping mission. these troops were initially sent under the terms of a mutual protection pact between france and the ivory coast, but the mission has since evolved into the current un peacekeeping operation. the french armed forces have also played a leading role in the ongoing un peacekeeping mission along the lebanon-israel border as part of the cease-fire agreement that brought the 2006 lebanon war to an end. currently, france has 2,000 army personnel deployed along the border, including infantry, armour, artillery and air defence. there are also naval and air personnel deployed offshore.
the french joint force and training headquarters (état-major interarmées de force et d'entraînement) at air base 110 near creil maintains the ability to command a medium or large-scale international operation, and runs exercises . in 2011, from 19 march, france participated in the enforcement of a no-fly zone over northern libya, during the libyan civil war, in order to prevent forces loyal to muammar gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-gaddafi forces. this operation was known as opération harmattan and was part of france's involvement in the conflict in the nato-led coalition, enforcing un security council resolution 1973. on 11 january 2013 france begun operation serval to fight islamists in mali with african support but without nato involvement.
in may 2014, high ranking defence chiefs of the french armed forces threatened to resign if the defence budget received further cuts on top of those already announced in the 2013 white paper. they warned that further cuts would leave the armed forces unable to support operations abroad.
the head of the french armed forces is the president of the republic, in his role as "chef des armées". however, the constitution puts civil and military government forces at the disposal of the "gouvernement" (the executive cabinet of ministers chaired by the prime minister, who are not necessarily of the same political side as the president). the minister of the armed forces (as of 2017, the incumbent florence parly) oversees the military's funding, procurement and operations. historically, france relied a great deal on conscription to provide manpower for its military, in addition to a minority of professional career soldiers. following the algerian war, the use of non-volunteer draftees in foreign operations was ended; if their unit was called up for duty in war zones, draftees were offered the choice between requesting a transfer to another unit or volunteering for the active mission. in 1996, president jacques chirac's government announced the end of conscription and in 2001, conscription formally was ended. young people must still, however, register for possible conscription (should the situation call for it). as of 2017 the french armed forces have total menpower of 426,265, and has an active personnel of 368,962 (with the gendarmerie national).
it breaks down as follows (2015):
the reserve element of the french armed forces consists of two structures; the operational reserve and the citizens reserve. as of 2015 the strength of the operational reserve is 27,785 personnel.
apart from the three main service branches, the french armed forces also includes a fourth paramilitary branch called the national gendarmerie. it had a reported strength of 103,000 active personnel and 25,000 reserve personnel in 2018. they are used in everyday law enforcement, and also form a coast guard formation under the command of the french navy. there are however some elements of the gendarmerie that participate in french external operations, providing specialised law enforcement and supporting roles.
historically the national guard functioned as the army's reserve national defense and law enforcement militia. after 145 years since its disbandment, due to the risk of terrorist attacks in the country, the guard was officially reactivated, this time as a service branch of the armed forces, on 12 october 2016.
the french armed forces are divided into five service branches:
in addition, the national gendarmerie form a coast guard force called the gendarmerie maritime which is commanded by the french navy.
the national gendarmerie is primarily a military and airborne capable police force which serves as a rural and general purpose police force.
reactivated in 2016, the national guard serves as the official primary military and police reserve service of the armed forces. it also doubles as a force multiplier for law enforcement personnel during contingencies and to reinforce military personnel whenever being deployed within france and abroad.

in the 19th century france built a new colonial empire second only to the british empire. it was humiliated in the franco-prussian war of 1870–71, which marked the rise of germany to dominance in europe. france was on the winning side of the first world war, but fared poorly in the second world war. it fought losing wars in indochina (ending in 1954) and algeria (ending in 1958). the fourth republic collapsed and the fifth republic began in 1958 to the present. under charles de gaulle it tried to block american and british influence on the european community. since 1945 france has been a founding member of the united nations, of nato, and of the european coal and steel community (the european union's predecessor). as a charter member of the united nations, france holds one of the permanent seats in the security council and is a member of most of its specialized and related agencies.
france is also a founding member of the union for the mediterranean and the la francophonie and plays a key role, both in regional and in international affairs.
françois mitterrand, a socialist, emphasized european unity and the preservation of france's special relationships with its former colonies in the face of "anglo-saxon influence." a part of the enacted policies was formulated in the socialist party's 110 propositions for france, the electoral program for the 1981 presidential election. he had a warm and effective relationship with the conservative german chancellor helmut kohl. they promoted french-german bilateralism in europe and strengthened military cooperation between the two countries.
shortly after taking office, president sarkozy began negotiations with colombian president álvaro uribe and the left-wing guerrilla farc, regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially franco-colombian politician ingrid betancourt. according to some sources, sarkozy himself asked for uribe to release farc's "chancellor" rodrigo granda.
. furthermore, he announced on 24 july 2007, that french and european representatives had obtained the extradition of the bulgarian nurses detained in libya to their country. in exchange, he signed with gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts – and a $230 million (168 million euros) milan antitank missile sale. the contract was the first made by libya since 2004, and was negotiated with mbda, a subsidiary of eads. another 128 million euros contract would have been signed, according to tripoli, with eads for a tetra radio system. the socialist party (ps) and the communist party (pcf) criticized a "state affair" and a "barter" with a "rogue state". the leader of the ps, françois hollande, requested the opening of a parliamentary investigation.
on 8 june 2007, during the 33rd g8 summit in heiligendamm, sarkozy set a goal of reducing french co emissions by 50% by 2050 in order to prevent global warming. he then pushed forward the important socialist figure of dominique strauss-kahn as european nominee to the international monetary fund (imf). critics alleged that sarkozy proposed to nominate strauss-kahn as managing director of the imf to deprive the socialist party of one of its more popular figures.
sarkozy normalised what had been strained relations with nato. in 2009, france again was a fully integrated nato member. françois hollande has continued the same policy.
socialist françois hollande won election in 2012 as president. he adopted a generally hawkish foreign-policy, in close collaboration with germany in regard to opposing russian moves against ukraine, and in sending the military to fight radical islamists in africa. he takes a hard line with regard to the greek debt crisis. françois hollande launched two military operations in africa: operation serval in mali (the french armed forces stopped an islamist takeover of bamako, the nation's capital city); and operation sangaris (to restore peace there as tensions between different religious communities had turned into a violent conflict). france was also the first european nation to join the united states in bombing the islamic state of iraq and the levant. under president hollande, france's stances on the civil war in syria and iran's nuclear program has been described as "hawkish".

france established relations with the middle east during the reign of louis xiv. to keep austria from intervening into its plans regarding western europe he lent limited support to the ottoman empire, though the victories of prince eugene of savoy destroyed these plans. in the nineteenth century france together with great britain tried to strengthen the ottoman empire, the now "sick man of europe", to resist russian expansion, culminating in the crimean war.
france also pursued close relations with the semi-autonomous egypt. in 1869 egyptian workers -under the supervision of france- completed the suez canal. a rivalry emerged between france and britain for control of egypt, and eventually britain emerged victorious by buying out the egyptian shares of the company before the french had time to act.
after the unification of germany in 1871, germany successfully attempted to co-op france's relations with the ottomans. in world war i the ottoman empire joined the central powers, and was defeated by france and britain. after the collapse of the ottoman empire france and britain divided the middle east between themselves. france received syria and lebanon.
these colonies were granted independence after 1945, but france still tried to forge cultural and educational bonds between the areas, particularly with lebanon. relationships with syria are more strained, due to the policies of that country. in 2005, france, along with the united states, pressured syria to evacuate lebanon.
in the post-world war ii era french relations with the arab middle east reached a very low point. the war in algeria between muslim fighters and french colonists deeply concerned the rest of the muslim world. the algerian fighters received much of their supplies and funding from egypt and other arab powers, much to france's displeasure.
most damaging to franco-arab relations, however, was the suez crisis. it greatly diminished france's reputation in the region. france openly supported the israeli attack on the sinai peninsula, and was working against nasser, then a popular figure in the middle east. the suez crisis also made france and the united kingdom look again like imperialist powers attempting to impose their will upon weaker nations. another hindrance to france's relations with the arab middle east was its close alliance with israel during the 1950s.
this all changed with the coming of charles de gaulle to power. de gaulle's foreign policy was centered around an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, and at the same time increase france's international prestige. de gaulle hoped to move france from being a follower of the united states to becoming the leading nation of a large group of non-aligned countries. the nations de gaulle looked at as potential participants in this group were those in france's traditional spheres of influence: africa and the middle east. the former french colonies in eastern and northern africa were quite agreeable to these close relations with france. these nations had close economic and cultural ties to france, and they also had few other suitors amongst the major powers. this new orientation of french foreign policy also appealed strongly to the leaders of the arab nations. none of them wanted to be dominated by either of the superpowers, and they supported france's policy of trying to balance the us and the ussr and to prevent either from becoming dominant in the region. the middle eastern leaders wanted to be free to pursue their own goals and objectives, and did not want to be chained to either alliance block. de gaulle hoped to use this common foundation to build strong relations between the nations. he also hoped that good relations would improve france's trade with the region. de gaulle also imagined that these allies would look up to the more powerful french nation, and would look to it in leadership in matters of foreign policy.
the end of the algerian conflict in 1962 accomplished much in this regard. france could not portray itself as a leader of the oppressed nations of the world if it still was enforcing its colonial rule upon another nation. the battle against the muslim separatists that france waged in favour of the minority of white settlers was an extremely unpopular one throughout the muslim world. with the conflict raging it would have been close to impossible for france to have had positive relations with the nations of the middle east. the middle eastern support for the fln guerillas was another strain on relations that the end of the conflict removed. most of the financial and material support for the fln had come from the nations of the middle east and north africa. this was especially true of nasser's egypt, which had long supported the separatists. egypt is also the most direct example of improved relations after the end of hostilities. the end of the war brought an immediate thaw to franco-egyptian relations, egypt ended the trial of four french officers accused of espionage, and france ended its trade embargo against egypt.
in 1967 de gaulle completely overturned france's israel policy. de gaulle and his ministers reacted very harshly to israel's actions in the six-day war. the french government and de gaulle condemned israel's treatment of refugees, warned that it was a mistake to occupy the west bank and gaza strip, and also refused to recognize the israeli control of jerusalem. the french government continued to criticize israel after the war and de gaulle spoke out against other israeli actions, such as the operations against the palestine liberation organization in lebanon. france began to use its veto power to oppose israel in the un, and france sided with the arab states on almost all issues brought to the international body. most importantly of all, however, de gaulle's government imposed an arms embargo on the israeli state. the embargo was in fact applied to all the combatants, but very soon france began selling weaponry to the arab states again. as early as 1970 france sold libya a hundred dassault mirage fighter jets. however, after 1967 france continued to support israel's right to exist, as well as israel's many preferential agreements with france and the european economic community.
in the second half of the 20th century, france increased its expenditures in foreign aid greatly, to become second only to the united states in total aid amongst the western powers and first on a per capita basis. by 1968 france was paying out $855 million per year in aid far more than either west germany or the united kingdom. the vast majority of french aid was directed towards africa and the middle east, usually either as a lever to promote french interests or to help with the sale of french products (e.g. arms sales). france also increased its expenditures on other forms of aid sending out skilled individuals to developing countries to provide technical and cultural expertise.
the combination of aid money, arms sales, and diplomatic alignments helped to erase the memory of the suez crisis and the algerian war in the arab world and france successfully developed amicable relationships with the governments of many of the middle eastern states. nasser and de gaulle, who shared many similarities, cooperated on limiting american power in the region. nasser proclaimed france as the only friend of egypt in the west. france and iraq also developed a close relationship with business ties, joint military training exercises, and french assistance in iraq's nuclear program in the 1970s. france improved relations with its former colony syria, and eroded cultural links were partially restored.
in terms of trade france did receive some benefits from the improved relations with the middle east. french trade with the middle east increased by over fifty percent after de gaulle's reforms. the weaponry industries benefited most as france soon had lucrative contracts with many of the regimes in the middle east and north africa, though these contracts account for a negligible part of france's economy.
de gaulle had hoped that by taking a moderate path and not strongly supporting either side france could take part in the middle east peace process between israel and the arab nations. instead it has been excluded from any major role.
france plays a significant role in africa, especially in its former colonies, through extensive aid programs, commercial activities, military agreements, and cultural impact. in those former colonies where the french presence remains important, france contributes to political, military, and social stability. many think that french policy in africa – particularly where british interests are also involved – is susceptible to what is known as 'fashoda syndrome'. others have criticized the relationship as neocolonialism under the name "françafrique", stressing france's support of various dictatorships, among others: omar bongo, idriss déby, and denis sassou nguesso.
france has extensive political and economical relations with asian countries, including china, india, japan, south korea and southeast asia as well as an increasing presence in regional fora. france was instrumental in launching the asia–europe meeting (asem) process which could eventually emerge as a competitor to apec. france is seeking to broaden its commercial presence in china and will pose a competitive challenge to u.s. business, particularly in aerospace, high-tech, and luxury markets. in southeast asia, france was an architect of the paris peace accords, which ended the conflict in cambodia.
france does not have formal diplomatic relationships with north korea. north korea however maintains a "delegation" (not an embassy nor a consulate) near paris. as most countries, france does not recognize, nor have formal diplomatic relationships with taiwan, due to its recognition of china; however, taiwan maintains a representation office in paris which is similar to an embassy. likewise, the french institute in taipei has an administrative consular section that delivers visas and fulfills other missions normally dealt with by diplomatic outposts.
france has maintained its status as key power in western europe because of its size, location, strong economy, membership in european organizations, strong military posture and energetic diplomacy. france generally has worked to strengthen the global economic and political influence of the eu and its role in common european defense and collective security.
france supports the development of a european security and defence identity (esdi) as the foundation of efforts to enhance security in the european union. france cooperates closely with germany and spain in this endeavor.

french guinea () was a french colonial possession in west africa. its borders, while changed over time, were in 1958 those of the current independent nation of guinea.
french guinea was established by france in 1891, within the same borders as its previous colony known as rivières du sud (1882–1891). prior to 1882, the coastal portions of french guinea were part of the french colony of senegal.
in 1891, rivières du sud was placed under the colonial lieutenant governor at dakar, who had authority over the french coastal regions east to porto-novo (modern benin). in 1894 rivières du sud, cote d'ivoire and dahomey were separated into 'independent' colonies, with rivières du sud being renamed as the colony of french guinea. in 1895, french guinea was made one of several dependent colonies and its governor became one of several lieutenant governors who reported to a governor-general in dakar. in 1904, this federation of colonies was formalised as french west africa. french guinea, senegal, dahomey, cote d'ivoire and upper senegal and niger, were each ruled by a lieutenant governor, under the governor general in dakar.
guinea was ruled by france until 1958. it became independent from france in 1958 following its voters' rejection of charles de gaulle's constitution of 1958. at the time french guinea was the only colony to reject the new constitution. french guinea became the modern-day country of guinea, keeping french as its official language.

french polynesia (; ; ) is an overseas collectivity of the french republic and its sole overseas country. it is composed of 118 geographically dispersed islands and atolls stretching over an expanse of more than in the south pacific ocean. its total land area is .
french polynesia is divided into five groups of islands: the society islands archipelago, composed of the windward islands and the leeward islands; the tuamotu archipelago; the gambier islands; the marquesas islands; and the austral islands. among its 118 islands and atolls, 67 are inhabited. tahiti, which is located within the society islands, is the most populous island, having close to 69% of the population of french polynesia . papeete, located on tahiti, is the capital. although not an integral part of its territory, clipperton island was administered from french polynesia until 2007.
following the great polynesian migration, european explorers visited the islands of french polynesia on several occasions. traders and whaling ships also visited. in 1842, the french took over the islands and established a french protectorate they called "" (french establishments/settlements of oceania).
in 1946, the ' became an overseas territory under the constitution of the french fourth republic, and polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. in 1957, the ' were renamed french polynesia. in 1983 french polynesia became a member of the pacific community, a regional development organization. since 28 march 2003, french polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the french republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 february 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the president of french polynesia and its additional designation as an overseas country.
scientists believe the great polynesian migration happened around 1500 bc as austronesian people went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the south pacific ocean. the first islands of french polynesia to be settled were the marquesas islands in about 200 bc. the polynesians later ventured southwest and discovered the society islands around ad 300.
european encounters began in 1521 when portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan, sailing at the service of the spanish crown, sighted puka-puka in the tuāmotu-gambier archipelago. in 1606 another spanish expedition under pedro fernandes de queirós sailed through polynesia sighting an inhabited island on 10 february which they called sagitaria (or sagittaria), probably the island of rekareka to the southeast of tahiti.
over a century later, british explorer samuel wallis visited tahiti in 1767. french explorer louis antoine de bougainville also visited tahiti in 1768, while british explorer james cook arrived in 1769. in 1772, the spanish viceroy of peru don manuel de amat ordered a number of expeditions to tahiti under the command of domingo de bonechea who was the first european to explore all of the main islands beyond tahiti. a short-lived spanish settlement was created in 1774, and for a time some maps bore the name "isla de amat" after viceroy amat. in 1772, dutchman jakob roggeveen came across bora bora in the society islands. christian missions began with spanish priests who stayed in tahiti for a year. protestants from the london missionary society settled permanently in polynesia in 1797.
king pōmare ii of tahiti was forced to flee to mo'orea in 1803; he and his subjects were converted to protestantism in 1812. french catholic missionaries arrived on tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused france to send a gunboat in 1838. in 1842, tahiti and tahuata were declared a french protectorate, to allow catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. the capital of papeetē was founded in 1843. in 1880, france annexed tahiti, changing the status from that of a protectorate to that of a colony. the island groups were not officially united until the establishment of the french protectorate in 1889.
after france declared a protectorate over tahiti in 1840, the british and french signed the jarnac convention in 1847, declaring that the kingdoms of raiatea, huahine and bora bora were to remain independent from either powers and that no single chief was to be allowed to reign over the entire archipelago. france eventually broke the agreement, and the islands were annexed and became a colony in 1888 (eight years after the windward islands) after many native resistances and conflicts called the leewards war, lasting until 1897.
in the 1880s, france claimed the tuamotu archipelago, which formerly belonged to the pōmare dynasty, without formally annexing it. having declared a protectorate over tahuata in 1842, the french regarded the entire marquesas islands as french. in 1885, france appointed a governor and established a general council, thus giving it the proper administration for a colony. the islands of rimatara and rūrutu unsuccessfully lobbied for british protection in 1888, so in 1889 they were annexed by france. postage stamps were first issued in the colony in 1892. the first official name for the colony was "établissements de l'océanie" (establishments in oceania); in 1903 the general council was changed to an advisory council and the colony's name was changed to "établissements français de l'océanie" (french establishments in oceania).
in 1940, the administration of french polynesia recognised the free french forces and many polynesians served in world war ii. unknown at the time to the french and polynesians, the konoe cabinet in imperial japan on 16 september 1940 included french polynesia among the many territories which were to become japanese possessions, as part of the "eastern pacific government-general" in the post-war world. however, in the course of the war in the pacific the japanese were not able to launch an actual invasion of the french islands.
in 1946, polynesians were granted french citizenship and the islands' status was changed to an overseas territory; the islands' name was changed in 1957 to "polynésie française" (french polynesia). in 1962, france's early nuclear testing ground of algeria became independent and the moruroa atoll in the tuamotu archipelago was selected as the new testing site; tests were conducted underground after 1974. in 1977, french polynesia was granted partial internal autonomy; in 1984, the autonomy was extended. french polynesia became a full overseas collectivity of france in 2003.
in september 1995, france stirred up widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing at fangataufa atoll after a three-year moratorium. the last test was on 27 january 1996. on 29 january 1996, france announced that it would accede to the comprehensive test ban treaty, and no longer test nuclear weapons.
french polynesia was relisted in the un list of non-self governing territories in 2013, making it eligible for a un-backed independence referendum. the relisting was made after the indigenous opposition was voiced and supported by the polynesian leaders group, pacific conference of churches, women’s international league for peace and freedom, non-aligned movement, world council of churches, and melanesian spearhead group.
under the terms of article 74 of the french constitution and the organic law 2014-192 on the statute of autonomy of french polynesia, politics of french polynesia takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic french overseas collectivity, whereby the president of french polynesia is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. executive power is exercised by the government. legislative power is vested in both the government and the assembly of french polynesia (the territorial assembly).
political life in french polynesia has been marked by great instability since the mid-2000s. on 14 september 2007, the pro-independence leader oscar temaru, was elected president of french polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes cast in the territorial assembly). he replaced former president gaston tong sang, opposed to independence, who lost a no-confidence vote in the assembly of french polynesia on 31 august after the longtime former president of french polynesia, gaston flosse, hitherto opposed to independence, sided with his long enemy oscar temaru to topple the government of gaston tong sang. oscar temaru, however, had no stable majority in the assembly of french polynesia, and new territorial elections were held in february 2008 to solve the political crisis.
the party of gaston tong sang won the territorial elections, but that did not solve the political crisis: the two minority parties of oscar temaru and gaston flosse, who together have one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of gaston tong sang, allied to prevent gaston tong sang from becoming president of french polynesia. gaston flosse was then elected president of french polynesia by the territorial assembly on 23 february 2008 with the support of the pro-independence party led by oscar temaru, while oscar temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by gaston flosse. both formed a coalition cabinet. many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence gaston flosse and the pro-independence oscar temaru, designed to prevent gaston tong sang from becoming president of french polynesia, could last very long.
at the french municipal elections held in march 2008, several prominent mayors who are member of the flosse-temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of french polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way gaston tong sang, whose party french polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of french polynesia by the last minute alliance between flosse and temaru's parties. eventually, on 15 april 2008 the government of gaston flosse was toppled by a constructive vote of no confidence in the territorial assembly when two members of the flosse-temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with tong sang's party. gaston tong sang was elected president of french polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. he offered posts in his cabinet to flosse and temaru's parties which they both refused. gaston tong sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.
between 1946 and 2003, french polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (', or "tom"). in 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (', or com). its statutory law of 27 february 2004 gives it the particular designation of "overseas country inside the republic" ("", or pom), but without legal modification of its status.
despite a local assembly and government, french polynesia is not in a free association with france, like the cook islands with new zealand. as a french overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the government of france, including the national gendarmerie (which also polices rural and border areas in metropolitan france), and french military forces. the collectivity government retains control over primary and secondary education, health, town planning, and the environment. the highest representative of the state in the territory is the high commissioner of the republic in french polynesia ().
french polynesia also sends three deputies to the french national assembly, one representing the leeward islands administrative subdivision and the south-western suburbs of papeete, another one representing papeete and its north-eastern suburbs, plus the commune (municipality) of mo'orea-mai'ao, the tuāmotu-gambier administrative division, and the marquesas islands administrative division, and the last one representing the rest of tahiti and the austral islands administrative subdivision. french polynesia also sends two senators to the french senate.
french polynesians vote in the french presidential elections. in the 2007 french presidential election, in which the pro-independence leader oscar temaru openly called to vote for the socialist candidate ségolène royal while the parties opposed to independence generally supported the center-right candidate nicolas sarkozy, the turnout in french polynesia was 69.12% in the first round of the election and 74.67% in the second round, both in favour of sarkozy, expressing their will to remain in the french republic (as compared to metropolitan france in the 2nd round: nicolas sarkozy 51.9%; ségolène royal 48.1%).
the islands of french polynesia make up a total land area of , scattered over more than of ocean. there are 118 islands in french polynesia (and many more islets or "motus" around atolls). the highest point is mount orohena on tahiti.
it is made up of six archipelagos. the largest and most populated island is tahiti, in the society islands.
the archipelagos are :
aside from tahiti, some other important atolls, islands, and island groups in french polynesia are: ahē, bora bora, hiva 'oa, huahine, mai'ao, maupiti, meheti'a, mo'orea, nuku hiva, raiatea, taha'a, tetiaroa, tupua'i, and tūpai.
french polynesia has five administrative subdivisions ("):
total population at the august 2017 census was 275,918 inhabitants. at the 2017 census, 68.7% of the population of french polynesia lived on the island of tahiti alone. the urban area of papeete, the capital city, has 136,771 inhabitants (2017 census).
at the 2017 census, 89.0% of people living in french polynesia were born in french polynesia (up from 87.3% in 2007), 8.1% were born in metropolitan france (down from 9.3% in 2007), 1.2% were born in overseas france outside of french polynesia (down from 1.4% in 2007), and 1.7% were born in foreign countries (down from 2.0% in 2007). the population of natives of metropolitan france living in french polynesia has declined in relative terms since the 1980s, but in absolute terms their population peaked at the 2007 census with 24,265 natives of metropolitan france living in french polynesia that year (not counting their children born in french polynesia). with the local economic crisis, their population declined to 22,278 at the 2012 census, and 22,387 at the 2017 census.
at the 1988 census, the last census which asked questions regarding ethnicity, 66.5% of people were ethnically unmixed polynesians, 7.1% were ethnically polynesians with light european and/or east asian mixing, 11.9% were europeans (mostly french), 9.3% were people of mixed european and polynesian descent, the so-called demis (literally meaning "half"), and 4.7% were east asians (mainly chinese).
chinese, demis, and the white populace are essentially concentrated on the island of tahiti, particularly in the urban area of papeete, where their share of the population is thus much greater than in french polynesia overall. despite a long history of ethnic mixing, ethnic tensions have been growing in recent years, with politicians using a xenophobic discourse and fanning the flame of nationalism.
french is the only official language of french polynesia. an organic law of 12 april 1996 states that "french is the official language, tahitian and other polynesian languages can be used." at the 2017 census, among the population whose age was 15 and older, 73.9% of people reported that the language they spoke the most at home was french (up from 68.6% at the 2007 census), 20.2% reported that the language they spoke the most at home was tahitian (down from 24.3% at the 2007 census), 2.6% reported marquesan and 0.2% the related mangareva language (same percentages for both at the 2007 census), 1.2% reported any of the austral languages (down from 1.3% at the 2007 census), 1.0% reported tuamotuan (down from 1.5% at the 2007 census), 0.6% reported a chinese dialect (41% of which was hakka) (down from 1.0% at the 2007 census), and 0.4% another language (more than half of which was english) (down from 0.5% at the 2007 census).
at the same census, 95.2% of people whose age was 15 or older reported that they could speak, read and write french (up from 94.7% at the 2007 census), whereas only 1.3% reported that they had no knowledge of french (down from 2.0% at the 2007 census). 86.5% of people whose age was 15 or older reported that they had some form of knowledge of at least one polynesian language (up from 86.4% at the 2007 census but down from 87.8% at the 2012 census), whereas 13.5% reported that they had no knowledge of any of the polynesian languages (down from 13.6% at the 2007 census but up from 12.2% at the 2012 census).
french polynesia came to the forefront of the world music scene in 1992, with the release of the tahitian choir's recordings of unaccompanied vocal christian music called himene tārava, recorded by french musicologist pascal nabet-meyer. this form of singing is common in french polynesia and the cook islands, and is distinguished by a unique drop in pitch at the end of the phrases, which is a characteristic formed by several different voices; it is also accompanied by steady grunting of staccato, nonsensical syllables.
christianity is the main religion of the islands. a majority of 54% belongs to various protestant churches, especially the maohi protestant church, which is the largest and accounts for more than 50% of the population. it traces its origins to pomare ii, the king of tahiti, who converted from traditional beliefs to the reformed tradition brought to the islands by the london missionary society.
latin rite roman catholics constitute a large minority with 30% of the population, which has its own ecclesiastical province, comprising the metropolitan archdiocese of papeete and its only suffragan, the diocese of taiohae. the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints had 25,841 members . community of christ, another denomination within the latter-day saint tradition, claimed 7,990 total french polynesian members as of 2015 including mareva arnaud tchong who serves in the church's governing council of twelve apostles. there were about 3,000 jehovah's witnesses in tahiti .
the polynesian traditional sport va'a is practiced in all the islands. french polynesia hosts the an international race between tahiti, huahine and bora bora.
french polynesia is famous for its reef break waves. teahupo'o is probably the most renowned, regularly ranked in the best waves of the world. this site hosts the annual billabong pro tahiti surf competition, the 7th stop of the world championship tour.
there are many spots to practice kitesurfing in french polynesia, with tahiti, moorea, bora-bora, maupiti and raivavae being among the most iconic.
french polynesia is internationally known for diving. each archipelago offers opportunities for divers. rangiroa and fakarava in the tuamotu islands are the most famous spots in the area.
the legal tender of french polynesia is the cfp franc which has a fixed exchange rate with the euro. the nominal gross domestic product (or gdp) of french polynesia in 2014 was 5.623 billion u.s. dollars at market local prices, the sixth-largest economy in oceania after australia, new zealand, hawaii, new caledonia, and papua new guinea. the gdp per capita was $20,098 in 2014 (at market exchange rates, not at ppp), lower than in hawaii, australia, new zealand, and new caledonia, but higher than all the independent insular states of oceania. both per capita and total figures were significantly lower than those recorded before the financial crisis of 2007–08.
french polynesia has a moderately developed economy, which is dependent on imported goods, tourism, and the financial assistance of mainland france. tourist facilities are well developed and are available on the major islands. main agricultural productions are coconuts (copra), vegetables and fruits. french polynesia exports noni juice, a high quality vanilla, and the famous black tahitian pearls which accounted for 55% of exports (in value) in 2008.
french polynesia's seafloor contains rich deposits of nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper that are not exploited.
in 2008, french polynesia's imports amounted to 2.2 billion u.s. dollars and exports amounted to 0.2 billion u.s. dollars.
there are 53 airports in french polynesia; 46 are paved. fa'a'ā international airport is the only international airport in french polynesia. each island has its own airport that serves flights to other islands. air tahiti is the main airline that flies around the islands.
in 2017, alcatel submarine networks, a unit of nokia, launched a massive project to connect many of the islands in french polynesia with underwater fiber optic cable. the project, called natitua will improve french polynesian broadband connectivity by linking tahiti to 10 islands in the tuamotu and marquesas archipelagos. in august 2018, a celebration was held to commemorate the arrival of a submarine cable from papeete to the atoll of hao, extending the network by about 1000 kilometres.

french polynesia is located in oceania. it is a group of six archipelagos in the south pacific ocean, about halfway between south america and australia. its area is about 4,167 km² (around 130 islands), of which 3,827 km² is land and 340 km² is (inland) water. it has a coastline of 2,525 km but no land borders with other countries.
there are 118 islands in french polynesia (and many more islets or "motus" around atolls). four of the islands are volcanic and one island is coral. makatea in french polynesia is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the pacific ocean – the others are banaba (ocean island) in kiribati and nauru. the terrain consists of a mixture of rugged high islands and low islands with reefs.
it is made up of six archipelagos. the largest and most populated island is tahiti, in the society islands.
the archipelagos are:
aside from tahiti, some other important atolls, islands, and island groups in french polynesia are: ahē, bora bora, hiva 'oa, huahine, mai'ao, maupiti, meheti'a, mo'orea, nuku hiva, raiatea, taha'a, tetiaroa, tupua'i, and tūpai. the country's highest point is mont orohena on tahiti at 2,241 meters high.
the country has a tropical, but moderate climate. occasional cyclonic storms occur in january.

this article is about the demographic features of the population of french polynesia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
the following demographic statistics are from the cia world factbook, unless otherwise indicated.

politics of french polynesia takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic french overseas collectivity, whereby the president of french polynesia is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. executive power is exercised by the government. legislative power is vested in both the government and the assembly of french polynesia.
between 1946 and 2003, french polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (french: "territoire d'outre-mer", or "tom"). in 2003 it became an overseas collectivity (french: "collectivité d'outre-mer", or com). its statutory law of 27 february 2004 gives it the particular designation of "overseas country" to underline the large autonomy of the territory.
the president of the french republic is represented by the high commissioner of the republic in french polynesia ("haut-commissaire de la république en polynésie française"). the government is headed by the president of french polynesia. he submits as council of ministers a list of members of the territorial assembly, the assembly of french polynesia ("assemblée de la polynésie française"), for approval by them to serve as ministers.
it has been hinted new elected president on september 14 will be an interim president before a new round of fresh parliamentary elections expected to take place by the end of the year, followed by a new presidential election.
french polynesia elects the assembly of french polynesia ("assemblée de la polynésie française"), the unicameral legislature on the territorial level. the assembly of french polynesia has 57 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies. since the territorial elections of march 6, 2001, the parity bill now binds that the number of women matches the number of men at the assembly.
the members of the assembly of french polynesia are elected in 6 different electoral districts or electoral circumscriptions () which slightly differ from the administrative subdivisions ("subdivisions administratives") on the tuamotus and the gambier islands. the 6 electoral circumscriptions ("circonscriptions électorales") are:
court of appeal or cour d'appel; court of the first instance or tribunal de premiere instance; court of administrative law or tribunal administratif.
french polynesia has 5 administrative subdivisions ():

french polynesia's economy is one of a developed country with a service sector accounting for 75%. the gdp per capita is around $22,000, one of the highest in the pacific area.
before french colonisation, the polynesian islands that constitute nowadays french polynesia, relied on a subsistence economy. work was heavily organised and performed by the community as a whole under the direction of the arii ruling class and the priests. mountains were terraced for agriculture production, river banks were contained by stone walls, artificial soil was created on atolls in large trenches, and large systems made out of coral stone walls trapped and stocked live fish. production outputs were divided by the ruling class between the population.
after the contact was established with european ships, foreign diseases killed large portions of the populations, and christian beliefs and clergy produced a huge shift in the culture of those islands. with fewer population to feed, more land per capita was available, and the land use switched toward the limited production required by a family to live. habitations moved toward seashores as the population relied more on the lagoon and sea trade. european ships stopped in those islands to purchase water, salt pork meat, dried fish and fresh fruits.
as french, english and americans settled, part of the agriculture moved towards exports of oranges, coprah, coffee, cotton, and vanilla. they also exported tahitian black pearls and sandalwood. santal wood nearly disappeared, cotton production was short lived as the usa's south recovered from the secession war, and coffee and orange trees suffered from imported diseases that stopped those exports. coprah and vanilla prices and competition worldwide impacted heavily those productions in the second half of the 20th century, although they still exist. the guano mining at makatea started in 1917 and stopped in 1966 when the stocks were depleted.
in 1962, france stationed military personnel in the region and started nuclear experimentations in moruroa. french polynesia's economy switched to services to support the military and the growing tourist industry.
tourism accounts nowadays for about 13% of the gdp, and is a primary source of foreign currency earnings. the tourist industry was heavily impacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 economic crises, and never really recovered since. there are around 160,000 tourists per year. the local government mostly focuses its action at developing a high-end market with luxurious hotels built with foreign investment and french tax cut incentives, but many of these investments close after a few years. the subsidized air company air tahiti nui brings tourists from france, los angeles, japan and china. other companies also operate, like air france and air new zealand.
the small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural products. vanilla and pearls are its main exports.
the public administration is an important part of the gdp and a provider of stable employment. the french republic finances the functionaries working in education, justice, hospitals, gendarmerie (military police), and military. the local government controls its own administration, like the ministry of agriculture, and oversees the administration and buildings of some sectors like schools. the local government also influence a large part of the economy through subsidies and development programs.
some parts of the economy involve quasi-monopolistic groups due to the small economy size, the challenges of a country of small islands spread in a huge oceanic space, and the action of the government through subsidies and public companies. some sectors show an important horizontal and vertical integration trend. recently, the local government tries to maintain a healthy competition and regulate the growth of the biggest groups, but face many challenges. for example, it was unable to prevent a major supermarket group to develop its own vegetable production, ending its supplying contracts with local farmers. but it blocked the merger of two local shipping companies to avoid a monopoly on some trade routes. the price of shipping goods between islands is fixed by the government, and subsidies are provided for transporting some items like farming products or construction materials.
some products' price margins are controlled by the local government to reduce the disparity of prices between the different archipelagos. import taxes and vat are fixed and collected by the local government that also control what imports are allowed to protect its agriculture and nature from diseases and invasive species.
the majority of the population is of mixed polynesian and european origin. around 5% of the population is of asian origin, descending from farm workers imported in the 19th century to work in the cotton fields. they are present in the administration and trading sector of the economy. the recent metropolitan population is mostly involved in the state administration and in small and medium-sized enterprises.
most polynesians in agriculture farm traditional products like taro, ufi, casava and sweet potato to feed themselves and small surplus are sold for monetary income alongside a small fishing activity. farmers of asian origin tends to produce european and asian vegetables for the local market.
the moorea island developed pineapple production for local market and supplying the juice factory. maupiti and huahine produce watermelons. tahiti and tahaa have a small production of sugarcane for rum distillery.
tahiti produces a small quantity of fresh milk, mostly for the local yogurt factory, as most of the population is used to drinking uht and powdered milk from france and new zealand. french polynesia has a single slaughterhouse treating beef, pork, and chickens. the local beef meat production is very limited and mostly used to supply the local corned beef factory. most of the meat comes from new zealand, amounting to around 10% of the exports of fresh meat of this country. two charcuteries produce ham, sausages, and pâtés from local and imported pork.
the copra production is heavily subsidized as the local government treats it as a form of social support for the remote islands with a limited range of economic activities possibilities like tuamotu atolls. the copra is milled by the huilerie de tahiti to produce coconut oil mostly used for the monoi. the coconut cake residue is used as a cattle and pork feed, and surplus used to be exported to new zealand.
vanilla production depends heavily on the situation in madagascar. when a typhoon hit this main supplier of vanilla, the market price increased worldwide and the local polynesian government started a heavy program of subsidies and loans to develop vanilla farms. as the polynesian production increased and madagascar recovered, prices dropped and a lot of polynesian farmers stopped caring for their vanilla plants. the plants are fragile and require regular care of experienced farmers. diseases and insects can heavily reduce the production, and the cost of chemical products used impact the farmer harder when the vanilla prices are low. as the vanilla production falls, the price increase and the government started a new program of development, starting a new cycle. despite the high price of tahitian dried vanilla on the international market, it usually still finds buyers in the high-end market because of the specificities of its cultivar and quality.
in the 1990s, the commercial production of noni started because of the supposed benefits of the juice of this fruit. exports were mostly directed toward the north american market. but this production was short-lived, falling quickly from 7000 tonnes in 2005 down to 2000 tonnes in 2008, as the plant can be easily farmed in any tropical climate, especially in countries with lower labor costs and more land.
a small vineyard production exists in rangiroa atoll and is aimed at the high-end market, capitalizing on its rarity and specificity of a vine grown on coral soil in a tropical island.
french polynesia's electricity production in 2004 was 477 gwh. in 1998 59.72% of french polynesia's electricity came from fossil fuel with the remainder from hydropower.
french polynesia uses the comptoirs francais du pacifique franc (cfpf), with 1 cfp franc subdivided into 100 centimes. the cfp franc was formerly linked at the exact official rate of 0.055 french francs to one pacifique franc. when france switched its currency to the euro in 1999 this static link remained true, so that the rate is now about 119.26 pacifique franc to one euro (1 euro being exactly 6.55957 french francs). in 2016 the exchange rate was 110.2 cfp francs per us dollar.

the honotua fiber optic cable connected tahiti to hawaii in 2010, increasing internet speeds to 20 gigabits per second from 500 megabits per second. the cable will also connect to moorea and the leeward islands of huahine, raiatea and bora bora.

the french southern and antarctic lands (, taaf) is an overseas territory ( or ) of france. it consists of:
the territory is sometimes referred to as the french southern lands () or french southern territories, usually to emphasize non-recognition of french sovereignty over adélie land as part of the antarctic treaty system.
approximatly 150 (in the winter) to 310 (in the summer) persons live in the french southern and antarctic lands but they are only military personnels, officials, scientific researchers and support staff. the territory has legally no permanent civilian population.
the french southern and antarctic lands have formed a (an overseas territory) of france since 1955. formerly, they were administered from paris by an assisted by a secretary-general; since december 2004, however, their administrator has been a "préfet", currently cécile pozzo di borgo, with headquarters in saint-pierre on réunion island.
the territory is divided into five districts:
each district is headed by a district chief, who has powers similar to those of a french mayor (including recording births and deaths and being an officer of judicial police).
because there is no permanent population, there is no elected assembly, nor does the territory send representatives to the national parliament.
the territory includes amsterdam island, saint-paul island, crozet islands, and the kerguelen islands in the southern indian ocean near 43°s, 67°e, along with adélie land, the sector of antarctica claimed by france, named by the french explorer jules dumont d'urville after his wife.
adélie land (about ) and the islands, totaling , have no indigenous inhabitants, though in 1997 there were about 100 researchers whose numbers varied from winter (july) to summer (january).
amsterdam island and saint-paul island are extinct volcanoes and have been delineated as the amsterdam and saint-paul islands temperate grasslands ecoregion. the highest point in the territory is mont ross on kerguelen island at . there are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.
the islands in the indian ocean are supplied by the special ship "marion dufresne" sailing out of le port in réunion island. terre adélie is supplied by "astrolabe" sailing out of hobart in tasmania.
however, the territory has a merchant marine fleet totaling (in 1999) 2,892,911 grt/, including seven bulk carriers, five cargo ships, ten chemical tankers, nine container ships, six liquefied gas carriers, 24 petroleum tankers, one refrigerated cargo ship, and ten roll-on-roll-off (roro) carriers. this fleet is maintained as a subset of the french register that allows french-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main french register. this register, however, is to vanish, replaced by the international french register ("registre international français", rif).
the territory's natural resources are limited to fish and crustaceans. economic activity is limited to servicing meteorological and geophysical research stations and french and other fishing fleets.
the main fish resources are patagonian toothfish and spiny lobster. both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the french navy, and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.
france previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from réunion island.
the territory takes in revenues of about €16 million a year.
the french southern territories (i.e. the taaf excluding adélie land) have been given the following country codes: fs (fips) and (iso 3166-1 alpha-2).

the history of french guiana spans many centuries. before the first europeans arrived, there was no written history in the territory. it was originally inhabited by a number of native american peoples, among them the kalina (caribs), arawak, emerillon, galibi, palikur, wayampi (also known as oyampi), and wayana. the first europeans arrived in the expeditions of christopher columbus, shortly before 1500.
in 1498 french guiana was first visited by europeans when christopher columbus sailed to the region on his third voyage and named it the "land of pariahs". in 1608 the grand duchy of tuscany sent an expedition to the area in order to create an italian colony for the commerce of amazonian products to renaissance italy, but the sudden death of ferdinando i de' medici, grand duke of tuscany stopped it.
in 1624 the french attempted to settle in the area, but was forced to abandon it in the face of hostility from the portuguese, who viewed it as a violation of the treaty of tordesillas. however french settlers returned in 1630 and in 1643 managed to establish a settlement at cayenne along with some small-scale plantations. this second attempt would again be abandoned following amerindian attacks. in 1658 the dutch west indies company seized french territory to establish the dutch colony of cayenne. the french returned once more in 1664, and founded a second settlement at sinnamary (this was attacked by the dutch in 1665).
in 1667 the english seized the area. following the treaty of breda on 31 july 1667 the area was given back to france. the dutch briefly occupied it for a period in 1676.
after the treaty of paris in 1763, which deprived france of almost all her possessions in the americas other than guiana and a few islands, louis xv sent thousands of settlers to guiana who were lured there with stories of plentiful gold and easy fortunes to be made. instead they found a land filled with hostile natives and tropical diseases. one and a half years later only a few hundred survived. these fled to three small islands which could be seen off shore and named them the iles de salut (or "islands of salvation"). the largest was called royal island, another st. joseph (after the patron saint of the expedition), and the smallest of the islands, surrounded by strong currents, île du diable (the infamous "devil's island"). when the survivors of this ill-fated expedition returned home, the terrible stories they told of the colony left a lasting impression in france.
in 1794, after the death of robespierre, 193 of his followers were sent to french guiana. in 1797 the republican general pichegru and many deputies and journalists were also sent to the colony. when they arrived they found that only 54 of the 193 deportées sent out three years earlier were left; 11 had escaped, and the rest had died of tropical fevers and other diseases. pichegru managed to escape to the united states and then returned to france where he was eventually executed for plotting against napoleon.
later on, slaves were brought out from africa and plantations were established along the more disease-free rivers. exports of sugar, hardwood, cayenne pepper and other spices brought a certain prosperity to the colony for the first time. cayenne, the capital, was surrounded by plantations, some of which had several thousand slaves.
in 1809 an anglo-portuguese naval squadron took french guiana (ousting governor victor hugues) and gave it to the portuguese in brazil. however, with the signing of the treaty of paris in 1814 the region was handed back to the french, though a portuguese presence remained until 1817.
in 1848 france abolished slavery and the ex-slaves fled into the rainforest, setting up communities similar to the ones they had come from in africa. subsequently called maroons, they formed a sort of buffer zone between the europeans (who settled along the coast and main rivers) and the unconquered (and often hostile) native american tribes of the inland regions. deprived of slave labour the plantations were soon taken over by the jungle, and the planters ruined.
in 1850 several shiploads of indians, malays and chinese were brought out to work the plantations but, instead, they set up shops in cayenne and other settlements.
in 1852 the first shiploads of chained convicts arrived from france. in 1885, to get rid of habitual criminals and to increase the number of colonists, the french parliament passed a law that anyone, male or female, who had more than three sentences for theft of more than three months each, would be sent to french guiana as a "relégué". these "relégués" were to be kept in prison there for six months but then freed to become settlers in the colony. however, this experiment failed dismally. the ex-prisoners, unable to make a living off the land found themselves forced to revert to crime or to eke out a hand-to-mouth existence until they died. in fact, transportation to french guiana as a "relégué" amounted to a life sentence, and usually a short life sentence, as most of the "relégués" died very quickly from disease and malnutrition.
the prisoners would arrive at st laurent du maroni before being transported to various camps throughout the country. the iles du salut were used to house political prisoners and for solitary confinement. the islands became notorious for the brutality of life there, centering on the notorious devil's island. famous figures sent to the islands included alfred dreyfus (in 1895) and henri charrière (in the 1930s). charrière managed to escape and later wrote a best-selling book about his experiences called "papillon".
in 1853, gold was discovered in the interior, precipitating border disputes with brazil and suriname (these were later settled in 1891, 1899 and 1915, although a small region of the border with suriname remains in dispute). the republic of independent guyana, in french "la république de la guyane indépendante" and commonly referred to by the name of the capital "counani", was created in the area which was disputed by france (as part of french guiana) and brazil in the late nineteenth century.
the territory of inini, consisting of most of the interior of french guiana, was created in 1930. it was abolished in 1946.
during world war ii the local government declared its allegiance to the vichy government, despite widespread support for charles de gaulle. this government was removed on 22 march 1943.
french guiana became an overseas "département" of france on 19 march 1946.
the infamous penal colonies, including devil's island, were gradually phased out and then formally closed in 1951. at first, only those freed prisoners who could raise the fare for their return passage to france were able to go home, so french guiana was haunted after the official closing of the prisons by numerous freed convicts leading an aimless existence in the colony.
visitors to the site in december 1954 reported being deeply shocked by the conditions and the constant screams from the cell-block still in use for convicts who had gone insane and which had only tiny ventilation slots at the tops of the walls under the roof. food was pushed in and bodies removed once a day.
in 1964 kourou was chosen to be launch site for rockets, largely due to its favourable location near the equator. the guiana space centre was built and became operational in 1968. this has provided some local employment and the mainly foreign technicians, and hundreds of troops stationed in the region to prevent sabotage, bring a little income to the local economy.
the 1970s saw the settlement of hmong refugees from laos in the county, primarily to the towns of javouhey and cacao. the green plan ("le plan vert") of 1976 aimed to improve production, though it had only limited success. a movement for increased autonomy from france gained momentum in the 70s and 80s, along with the increasing success of the parti socialiste guyanais.
protests by those calling for more autonomy from france have become increasingly vocal. protests in 1996, 1997 and 2000 all ended in violence. while many guianese wish to see more autonomy, support for complete independence is low.
in a 2010 referendum, french guianans voted against autonomy.
on march 20, 2017, french guianans began going on strike and demonstrating for more resources and infrastructure. march 28, 2017 saw the largest demonstration ever held in french guiana.

according to insee the population of french guiana was 239,450 of january 1, 2012. the population is very young: 44% are below the age of 20, while only 1.7% are 75 years or older. the age distribution is a reflection of the high fertility rates of french guiana.
on january 1, 2010, 64.5% of the population had french nationality, while 35.5% had a foreign nationality. of these, surinamese (13.8% of the total population), haitians (8.8%) and brazilians (8.7%) were the largest groups. smaller groups included people with nationality of guyana (1.7%), colombia (1.0%), china (0.5%), the dominican republic (0.4%) and peru (0.2%).
the total fertility rate in french guiana has remained high and is today considerably higher than in metropolitan france, and also higher than the average of the french overseas departments. it is largely responsible for the high population growth of french guiana.
structure of the population (01.01.2010) (provisional estimates) :
the infant mortality in french guiana is higher than in metropolitan france:
at birth, life expectancy is 76.2 years for male children, and 82.8 for female (figures for 2011).
estimates of the percentages of french guiana ethnic composition vary, a situation compounded by the large proportion of immigrants.
creoles, or mulattoes (people of mixed african and french ancestry), are the largest ethnic group, though estimates vary as to the exact percentage, depending upon whether the large haitian community is included as well. generally the creole population is judged to be about 60 to 70% of the total population if haitians (comprising roughly one-third of creoles) are included, and 30 to 50% without.
roughly 14% of the population is of european ancestry. the vast majority of these are of french heritage, though there are also people of dutch, british, spanish and portuguese ancestry.
the main asian communities are the chinese (about 3-4%, primarily from zhejiang province in mainland china and hong kong) and hmong from laos (1-2%). there are also smaller groups from various caribbean islands, mainly saint lucia as well as dominica. other asian groups include east indians, lebanese and vietnamese.
the main groups living in the interior are the maroons (formerly called "bush negroes") who are from african descent, and amerindians. the maroons, descendants of escaped african slaves, live primarily along the maroni river. the main maroon groups are the saramaca, aucan (both of whom also live in suriname), and boni (aluku).
the main amerindian groups (forming about 3%–4% of the population) are the arawak, carib, emerillon (now called teko), galibi (now called the kaliña), palikur, wayampi and wayana. as of the late 1990s, there was evidence of an uncontacted group of wayampi.
french and french guianese creole are the most widely spoken languages. there are also several native languages, including arawak (arawak and palikur), carib (kalina and wayana), and tupi-guarani (teko and wayampi). other languages spoken include hakka chinese and javanese.
the official language, like for all overseas departments and territories of france, is french.
the dominant religion of french guiana is roman catholicism; the maroons and amerindian people maintain their own religions. the hmong people are also mainly catholic owing to the influence of missionaries who helped bring them to french guiana.

french guiana is not a separate territory but is both an overseas région and overseas department of france, with the same government institutions as areas on the french mainland. the administrative center is cayenne.
the president of france appoints a prefect (resident at the prefecture building in cayenne) as his representative to head the local government of french guiana. there are two local executive bodies: the 19‑member general council and the 34‑member regional council, both elected. they will soon be reunited into a single council, since they have authority on exactly the same territory.
in 2014 the prefect is éric spitz. the president of the general council is alain tien-liong and the president of the regional council is rodolphe alexandre.
politics in french guiana are dominated by the guianese socialist party, which has a close association with the socialist party in mainland france.
a chronic issue affecting french guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine gold prospectors from brazil and suriname. the border between the department and suriname is formed by the maroni river, which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the gendarmerie and the french foreign legion to patrol.
there have been several phases launched by the french government to combat illegal gold mining in french guiana, beginning with operation anaconda beginning in 2003, followed by operation harpie in 2008, 2009 and operation harpie reinforce in 2010. colonel françois müller, the commander of french guiana's gendarme, believes these operations have been successful. however, after each operation ends, brazilian miners, garimpeiros, return. soon after operation harpie reinforce began, an altercation took place between french authorities and brazilian miners. on march 12, 2010, a team of french soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which "the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317". garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues. "the soldiers fired warning shots and rubber "flash balls" but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500 grammes of gold. "the violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grammes of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against illegal mining", said phillipe duporge, the director of french guiana's border police, at a press conference the next day."
the general council of french guiana is the deliberative executive assembly and is composed of 19 members who are elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms. it is led by the president of the general council of french guiana.
the regional council of french guiana is the elected assembly or regional council and is composed of 31 members who are elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms.
guiana elects two senators to the french senate. both of the current senators, georges patient and jean-étienne antoinette, are members of the guianese socialist party
guiana also elects two deputies to the french national assembly. the last elections were held in june 2007. the walwari has one deputy, christiane taubira, and the psg has one deputy, chantal berthelot, who defeated long-time ump incumbent léon bertrand.

the economy of french guiana is tied closely to that of mainland france through subsidies and imports. besides the french space center at kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities. the large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn logs for export. cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated; rice and manioc are the major crops. french guiana is heavily dependent on imports of food and energy. unemployment is a serious problem, particularly among younger workers.

françois roland truffaut (; 6 february 1932 – 21 october 1984) was a french film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film critic. he is widely regarded as one of the founders of the french new wave. in a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the french film industry, having worked on over 25 films. truffaut's film "the 400 blows" came to be a defining film of the french new wave movement, and was followed by four sequels, "antoine et colette", "stolen kisses", "bed and board", and "love on the run", between 1958 and 1979.
truffaut's 1973 film "day for night" earned him critical acclaim and several accolades, including the bafta award for best film and the academy award for best foreign language film. his other notable films include "shoot the piano player" (1960), "jules and jim" (1961), "the soft skin" (1964), "the wild child" (1970), "two english girls" (1971), "the last metro" (1980), and "the woman next door" (1981).
truffaut was born in paris on 6 february 1932. his mother was janine de montferrand. his mother's future husband, roland truffaut, accepted him as an adopted son and gave him his surname. he was passed around to live with various nannies and his grandmother for a number of years. it was his grandmother who instilled in him her love of books and music. he lived with his grandmother until her death, when truffaut was eight years old. it was only after his grandmother's death that he lived with his parents for the first time. the identity of truffaut's biological father was unknown, though a private detective agency in 1968 revealed that their inquiry into the matter led to a roland levy, a jewish dentist from bayonne. truffaut's mother's family disputed the findings but truffaut himself believed and embraced them.
truffaut would often stay with friends and try to be out of the house as much as possible. his best friend throughout his youth and until his death was robert lachenay, who was the inspiration for the character rené bigey in "the 400 blows" and would work as an assistant on some of truffaut's films. it was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. he was eight years old when he saw his first movie, abel gance's "paradis perdu" ("paradise lost") from 1939. it was there that his obsession began. he frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. after being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.
truffaut frequented henri langlois' cinémathèque française where he was exposed to countless foreign films from around the world. it was here that he became familiar with american cinema and directors such as john ford, howard hawks and nicholas ray, as well as those of british director alfred hitchcock.
after starting his own film club in 1948, truffaut met andré bazin, who would have great effect on his professional and personal life. bazin was a critic and the head of another film society at the time. he became a personal friend of truffaut's and helped him out of various financial and criminal situations during his formative years.
truffaut joined the french army in 1950, aged 18, but spent the next two years trying to escape. truffaut was arrested for attempting to desert the army and incarcerated in military prison. bazin used his various political contacts to get truffaut released and set him up with a job at his newly formed film magazine "cahiers du cinéma".
over the next few years, truffaut became a critic (and later editor) at "cahiers", where he became notorious for his brutal, unforgiving reviews. he was called "the gravedigger of french cinema" and was the only french critic not invited to the cannes film festival in 1958. he supported bazin in the development of one of the most influential theories of cinema itself, the auteur theory.
in 1954, truffaut wrote an article in "cahiers du cinéma" called "une certaine tendance du cinéma français" ("a certain trend of french cinema"), in which he attacked the current state of french films, lambasting certain screenwriters and producers, and listing eight directors he considered incapable of devising the kinds of "vile" and "grotesque" characters and storylines that he declared were characteristic of the mainstream french film industry: jean renoir, robert bresson, jean cocteau, jacques becker, abel gance, max ophuls, jacques tati and roger leenhardt. the article caused a storm of controversy, and also landed truffaut an offer to write for the nationally circulated, more widely read cultural weekly "arts-lettres-spectacles". truffaut would pen more than 500 film articles for that publication over the next four years.
truffaut later devised the auteur theory, which stated that the director was the "author" of his work; that great directors such as renoir or hitchcock have distinct styles and themes that permeate all of their films. although his theory was not widely accepted then, it gained some support in the 1960s from american critic andrew sarris. in 1967, truffaut published his book-length interview of hitchcock, "hitchcock/truffaut" (new york: simon and schuster).
after having been a critic, truffaut decided to make films of his own. he started out with the short film "une visite" in 1955 and followed that up with "les mistons" in 1957.
after seeing orson welles' "touch of evil" at the expo 58, he was inspired to make his feature film directorial debut with "the 400 blows", which was released in 1959 to much critical and commercial acclaim. truffaut received a best director award from the cannes film festival, the same festival that had banned him only one year earlier.
the film follows the character of antoine doinel through his perilous misadventures in school, an unhappy home life and later reform school. the film is highly autobiographical. both truffaut and doinel were only children of loveless marriages; they both committed petty crimes of theft and truancy from the military. truffaut cast jean-pierre léaud as antoine doinel. léaud was seen as an ordinary boy of 14 who auditioned for the role after seeing a flyer, but interviews filmed after the film's release (one is included on the criterion dvd of the film) reveal léaud's natural sophistication and an instinctive understanding of acting for the camera. léaud and truffaut collaborated on several films over the years. their most noteworthy collaboration was the continuation of the antoine doinel character in a series of films called "the antoine doinel cycle".
the primary focus of "the 400 blows" is on the life of a young character by the name of antoine doinel. this film follows this character through his troubled adolescence. he is caught in between an unstable parental relationship and an isolated youth. the film focuses on the real life events of the director, françois truffaut. from birth truffaut was thrown into an undesired situation. as he was born out of wedlock, his birth had to remain a secret because of the social stigma associated with illegitimacy. he was registered as "a child born to an unknown father" in the hospital records. he was looked after by a nurse for an extended period of time. his mother eventually married and her husband roland gave his surname, truffaut, to françois.
although he was legally accepted as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. the truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. this experience saddened them greatly and as a result they despised françois because of the memory of regret that he represented (knopf 4). he was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. françois was sent to live with his grandparents. it wasn't until françois's grandmother's death before his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. the experiences with his mother were harsh. he recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. the relationship with roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. françois had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. they would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. he even recalled memories of being alone during christmas. being left alone forced françois into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. his father would mostly laugh them off.
"the 400 blows" marked the beginning of the french new wave movement, which gave directors such as jean-luc godard, claude chabrol and jacques rivette a wider audience. the new wave dealt with a self-conscious rejection of traditional cinema structure. this was a topic on which truffaut had been writing for years.
following the success of "the 400 blows", truffaut featured disjunctive editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film "shoot the piano player" (1960) starring charles aznavour. truffaut has stated that in the middle of filming, he realized that he hated gangsters. but since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking.
even though "shoot the piano player" was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. while the film focused on two of the french new wave's favorite elements, american film noir and themselves, truffaut never again experimented as heavily.
in 1962, truffaut directed his third movie, "jules and jim", a romantic drama starring jeanne moreau. the film was very popular and highly influential.
in 1963, truffaut was approached to direct an american film called "bonnie and clyde", with a treatment written by "esquire" journalists, david newman and robert benton intended to introduce the french new wave to hollywood. although he was interested enough to help in script development, truffaut ultimately declined, but not before interesting jean-luc godard and american actor and would be producer, warren beatty, the latter of whom proceeded with the film with director arthur penn.
his fourth movie as director was "the soft skin" (1964) which was not well acclaimed on initial release.
truffaut's first non-french film was a 1966 adaptation of ray bradbury's classic science fiction novel "fahrenheit 451", showcasing truffaut's love of books. his only english-speaking film made on location in england was a great challenge for truffaut, because he barely spoke english himself. this was also his first film shot in color by genius cinematographer nicolas roeg. the larger scale production was difficult for truffaut, who had worked only with small crews and budgets. the shoot was also strained by a conflict with lead actor oscar werner who was unhappy with his character and stormed off set leaving truffaut to shoot scenes using a body double shot from behind. the film was a commercial failure and truffaut never worked outside france again. but the film's cult standing has steadily grown and it is considered a classic of the sci-fi genre.
truffaut worked on projects with varied subjects. "the bride wore black" (1968), a brutal tale of revenge, is a stylish homage to the films of alfred hitchcock (once again starring jeanne moreau).
"stolen kisses" (1968) was a continuation of the antoine doinel cycle starring claude jade as antoine's fiancée and later wife christine darbon. it was a big hit on the international art circuit. a short time later claude jade made her hollywood debut in hitchcock's "topaz".
"mississippi mermaid" (1969), with catherine deneuve and jean-paul belmondo is an identity-bending romantic thriller.
"the wild child" (1970) included truffaut's acting debut in the lead role of 18th century physician jean marc gaspard itard.
"bed and board" (1970) was another antoine doinel film, also with claude jade from "stolen kisses" who is now léaud's on-screen-wife.
"two english girls" (1971) is the female reflection of the same love story as "jules et jim". it is based on a story written by henri-pierre roche, who also wrote "jules and jim". it is about a man who falls equally in love with two sisters, and their love affair over a period of years.
"such a gorgeous kid like me" (1972) was a screwball comedy that was not well received.
"day for night" won truffaut a best foreign film oscar in 1973. the film is probably his most reflective work. it is the story of a film crew trying to finish their film while dealing with all of the personal and professional problems that accompany making a movie. truffaut plays the director of the fictional film being made. this film features scenes shown in his previous films. it is considered to be his best film since his earliest work. "time" magazine placed it on their list of 100 best films of the century (along with "the 400 blows").
in 1975, truffaut gained more notoriety with "the story of adèle h." isabelle adjani in the title role earned a nomination for a best actress oscar.
truffaut's 1976 film "small change" gained a golden globe nomination for best foreign film.
"the man who loved women" (1977), a romantic drama, was a minor hit.
"the green room" (1978) starred truffaut himself in the lead.
it was a box office flop so he made "love on the run" (1979) starring jean-pierre léaud and claude jade is the final movie of the doinel cycle.
one of truffaut's final films gave him an international revival. in 1980, his film "the last metro" garnered twelve césar award nominations with ten wins, including best director.
truffaut's last film was shot in black and white, giving his career a sense of having bookends. "confidentially yours" is truffaut's tribute to his favorite director, alfred hitchcock. it deals with numerous hitchcockian themes, such as private guilt versus public innocence, a woman investigating a murder, and anonymous locations.
some of truffaut's films feature the character antoine doinel, played by the actor jean-pierre léaud. he began his career in "the 400 blows" at the age of fourteen, and continued as the favorite actor and "double" of truffaut. the series continued with "antoine and colette" (a short film in the anthology "love at twenty"), "stolen kisses" (in which he falls in love with christine darbon alias claude jade), "bed and board" about the married couple antoine and christine—and, finally, "love on the run", where the couple go through a divorce.
in the last films, léaud's girlfriend and later wife, christine darbon, was played by truffaut's favorite actress, claude jade. during the filming of "stolen kisses", truffaut himself fell in love with, and was briefly engaged to, claude jade.
a keen reader, truffaut adapted many literary works, including two novels by henri-pierre roché, ray bradbury's "fahrenheit 451", henry james' "the altar of the dead", filmed as "the green room", and several american detective novels.
truffaut's other films were from original screenplays, often co-written by the screenwriters suzanne schiffman or jean gruault. they featured diverse subjects, the sombre "the story of adèle h.", inspired by the life of the daughter of victor hugo, with isabelle adjani; "day for night", shot at the victorine studios describing the ups and downs of film-making; and "the last metro", set during the german occupation of france, a film rewarded by ten césar awards.
known as lifelong cinephile, truffaut once (according to the 1993 documentary film "") threw a hitchhiker he had picked up out of his car after learning that the hitchhiker didn't like films.
truffaut is admired among other filmmakers and several tributes to his work have appeared in other films such as "almost famous", "face" and "the diving bell and the butterfly", as well as novelist haruki murakami's "kafka on the shore".
he also acted, appearing in steven spielberg's 1977 film "close encounters of the third kind", where he played scientist claude lacombe.
truffaut expressed his admiration for filmmakers such as luis buñuel, ingmar bergman, robert bresson, roberto rossellini, and alfred hitchcock. truffaut wrote "hitchcock/truffaut", a book about hitchcock, based on a lengthy series of interviews.
on jean renoir, he said: "i think renoir is the only filmmaker who's practically infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. and i think if he never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. he's one film director who never pretended. he never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt with all sorts of subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".
in 1973, jean-luc godard accused truffaut of making a movie that was a "lie" ("day for night"), and truffaut replied with a 20-page letter in which he accused godard of being a radical-chic hypocrite, a man who believed everyone to be "equal" in theory only. "the ursula andress of militancy—like brando—a piece of sh#t on a pedestal." the two never spoke or saw each other again. however, as noted by serge toubiana and antoine de baecque in their biography of truffaut, godard tried to reconcile their friendship later on, and after truffaut's death wrote the introduction to a collection of his letters and a lengthy tribute in his video-essay film "histoire(s) du cinéma".
truffaut was married to madeleine morgenstern from 1957 to 1965, and they had two daughters, laura (born 1959) and eva (born 1961). madeleine was the daughter of ignace morgenstern, managing director of one of france's largest film distribution companies, and was largely responsible for securing funding for truffaut's first films. he had affairs with many of his leading ladies: in 1968 he was engaged to actress claude jade; truffaut and actress fanny ardant lived together from 1981 to 1984 and had a daughter, joséphine truffaut (born 28 september 1983).
truffaut was an atheist, although he had great respect for the catholic church and even requested a mass for his funeral.
in july 1983, truffaut rented france gall's and michel berger's house outside honfleur, normandy (composing for philippe labro's film "rive droite, rive gauche") when he had his first stroke and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. he was expected to attend his friend miloš forman's "amadeus" premiere when he died on 21 october 1984, aged 52, at the american hospital in neuilly-sur-seine in france.

the 1710 statute of anne, an act of the parliament of great britain, created copyright law to replace a system of private ordering enforced by the stationers' company. the statute of anne did not provide for legal unauthorized use of material protected by copyright. in "gyles v wilcox", the court of chancery established the doctrine of "fair abridgement", which permitted unauthorized abridgement of copyrighted works under certain circumstances. over time, this doctrine evolved into the modern concepts of fair use and fair dealing. fair use was a common-law doctrine in the u.s. until it was incorporated into the copyright act of 1976, .
the term "fair use" originated in the united states. although related, the limitations and exceptions to copyright for teaching and library archiving in the u.s. are located in a different section of the statute. a similar-sounding principle, fair dealing, exists in some other common law jurisdictions but in fact it is more similar in principle to the enumerated exceptions found under civil law systems. civil law jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.
in response to perceived over-expansion of copyrights, several electronic civil liberties and free expression organizations began in the 1990s to add fair use cases to their dockets and concerns. these include the electronic frontier foundation ("eff"), the american civil liberties union, the national coalition against censorship, the american library association, numerous clinical programs at law schools, and others. the "chilling effects" archive was established in 2002 as a coalition of several law school clinics and the eff to document the use of cease and desist letters. most recently, in 2006, stanford university began an initiative called "the fair use project" (fup) to help artists, particularly filmmakers, fight lawsuits brought against them by large corporations.
examples of fair use in united states copyright law include commentary, search engines, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, and scholarship. fair use provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor test.
the u.s. supreme court has traditionally characterized fair use as an affirmative defense, but in "lenz v. universal music corp." (2015) (the "dancing baby" case), the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that fair use was not merely a defense to an infringement claim, but was an expressly authorized right, and an exception to the exclusive rights granted to the author of a creative work by copyright law: "fair use is therefore distinct from affirmative defenses where a use infringes a copyright, but there is no liability due to a valid excuse, e.g., misuse of a copyright."
the four factors of analysis for fair use set forth above derive from the opinion of joseph story in "folsom v. marsh", in which the defendant had copied 353 pages from the plaintiff's 12-volume biography of george washington in order to produce a separate two-volume work of his own. the court rejected the defendant's fair use defense with the following explanation:
the statutory fair use factors quoted above come from the copyright act of 1976, which is codified at . they were intended by congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. as judge pierre n. leval has written, the statute does not "define or explain [fair use's] contours or objectives." while it "leav[es] open the possibility that other factors may bear on the question, the statute identifies none." that is, courts are entitled to consider other factors in addition to the four statutory factors.
the first factor is "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." to justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.
in the 1841 copyright case folsom v. marsh, justice joseph story wrote:
a key consideration in recent fair use cases is the extent to which the use is "transformative". in the 1994 decision "campbell v. acuff-rose music inc", the u.s. supreme court held that when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use. before the "campbell" decision, federal judge pierre leval argued that transformativeness is central to the fair use analysis in his 1990 article, toward a fair use standard. "blanch v. koons" is another example of a fair use case that focused on transformativeness. in 2006, jeff koons used a photograph taken by commercial photographer andrea blanch in a collage painting. koons appropriated a central portion of an advertisement she had been commissioned to shoot for a magazine. koons prevailed in part because his use was found transformative under the first fair use factor.
the "campbell" case also addressed the subfactor mentioned in the quotation above, "whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." in an earlier case, "sony corp. of america v. universal city studios, inc.", the supreme court had stated that "every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair." in "campbell", the court clarified that this is not a "hard evidentiary presumption" and that even the tendency that commercial purpose will "weigh against a finding of fair use . . . will vary with the context." the "campbell" court held that hip-hop group 2 live crew's parody of the song "oh, pretty woman" was fair use, even though the parody was sold for profit. thus, having a commercial purpose does not preclude a use from being found fair, even though it makes it less likely.
likewise, the noncommercial purpose of a use makes it more likely to be found a fair use, but it does not make it a fair use automatically. for instance, in "l.a. times v. free republic", the court found that the noncommercial use of "los angeles times" content by the free republic web site was not fair use, since it allowed the public to obtain material at no cost that they would otherwise pay for. richard story similarly ruled in "code revision commission and state of georgia v. public.resource.org, inc." that despite the fact that it is a non-profit and didn't sell the work, the service profited from its unauthorized publication of the official code of georgia annotated because of "the attention, recognition, and contributions" it received in association with the work.
another factor is whether the use fulfills any of the preamble purposes, also mentioned in the legislation above, as these have been interpreted as "illustrative" of transformative use.
it is arguable, given the dominance of a rhetoric of the "transformative" in recent fair use determinations, that the first factor and transformativeness in general have become the most important parts of fair use.
although the supreme court has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.
to prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, facts and ideas are not protected by copyright—only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. on the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. the zapruder film of the assassination of president kennedy, for example, was purchased and copyrighted by "time" magazine. yet its copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when "time" tried to enjoin the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in "time inc v. bernard geis associates".
in the decisions of the second circuit in "salinger v. random house" and in "new era publications int'l v. henry holt & co", the aspect of whether the copied work has been previously published was considered crucial, assuming the right of the original author to control the circumstances of the publication of his work or preference not to publish at all. however, judge pierre n. leval views this importation of certain aspects of france's "droit moral d'artiste" (moral rights of the artist) into american copyright law as "bizarre and contradictory" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect. this is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than laws about copyright. the statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: "the fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."
the third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. in general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.
using most or all of a work does not bar a finding of fair use. it simply makes the third factor less favorable to the defendant. for instance, in "sony corp. of america v. universal city studios, inc." copying entire television programs for private viewing was upheld as fair use, at least when the copying is done for the purposes of time-shifting. in "kelly v. arriba soft corporation", the ninth circuit held that copying an entire photo to use as a thumbnail in online search results did not even weigh against fair use, "if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use".
however, even the use of a small percentage of a work can make the third factor unfavorable to the defendant, because the "substantiality" of the portion used is considered in addition to the amount used. for instance, in "harper & row v. nation enterprises", the u.s. supreme court held that a news article's quotation of fewer than 400 words from president ford's 200,000-word memoir was sufficient to make the third fair use factor weigh against the defendants, because the portion taken was the "heart of the work". this use was ultimately found not to be fair.
the fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. the court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. the burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.
for example, in "sony corp v. universal city studios", the copyright owner, universal, failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of betamax had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. in "harper & row," the case regarding president ford's memoirs, the supreme court labeled the fourth factor "the single most important element of fair use" and it has enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. yet the supreme court's more recent announcement in "campbell v. acuff-rose music inc" that "all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.
in evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market for the original work.
courts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not negate fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. copyright considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.
as explained by judge leval, courts are permitted to include additional factors in their analysis.
one such factor is acknowledgement of the copyrighted source. giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it does not automatically make a use fair. while plagiarism and copyright infringement are related matters, they are not identical. plagiarism (using someone's words, ideas, images, etc. without acknowledgment) is a matter of professional ethics. copyright is a matter of law, and protects exact expression, "not" ideas. one can plagiarize even a work that is not protected by copyright, for example by passing off a line from shakespeare as one's own. conversely, attribution prevents accusations of plagiarism, but it does not prevent infringement of copyright. for example, reprinting a copyrighted book without permission, while citing the original author, would be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.
the u.s. supreme court described fair use as an affirmative defense in "campbell v. acuff-rose music, inc." this means that in litigation on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the burden of raising and proving that the use was fair and not an infringement. thus, fair use need not even be raised as a defense unless the plaintiff first shows (or the defendant concedes) a "prima facie" case of copyright infringement. if the work was not copyrightable, the term had expired, or the defendant's work borrowed only a small amount, for instance, then the plaintiff cannot make out a "prima facie" case of infringement, and the defendant need not even raise the fair use defense. in addition, fair use is only one of many limitations, exceptions, and defenses to copyright infringement. thus, a "prima facie" case can be defeated without relying on fair use. for instance, the audio home recording act establishes that it is legal, using certain technologies, to make copies of audio recordings for non-commercial personal use.
some copyright owners claim infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed, in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in their defense. strategic lawsuit against public participation (slapp) cases such as these—alleging copyright infringement, patent infringement, defamation, or libel—often come into conflict with the defendant's right to freedom of speech, and has prompted some jurisdictions to pass anti-slapp legislation which raises the plaintiff's burdens and risk.
although fair use ostensibly permits certain uses without liability, many content creators and publishers try to avoid a potential court battle by seeking a legally unnecessary license from copyright owners for "any" use of non-public domain material, even in situations where a fair use defense would likely succeed. the simple reason is that the license terms negotiated with the copyright owner may be much less expensive than defending against a copyright suit, or having the mere possibility of a lawsuit threaten the publication of a work in which a publisher has invested significant resources.
fair use rights take precedence over the author's interest. thus the copyright holder cannot use a non-binding disclaimer, or notification, to revoke the right of fair use on works. however, binding agreements such as contracts or licence agreements may take precedence over fair use rights.
the practical effect of the fair use doctrine is that a number of conventional uses of copyrighted works are not considered infringing. for instance, quoting from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it or teach students about it, is considered a fair use. certain well-established uses cause few problems. a teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. all the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though they may sell their review commercially; but a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.
fair use is decided on a case by case basis, on the entirety of circumstances. the same act done by different means or for a different purpose can gain or lose fair use status. even repeating an identical act at a different time can make a difference due to changing social, technological, or other surrounding circumstances.
the case "oracle america, inc. v. google, inc." revolves around the use of application programming interfaces (apis) used to define functionality of the java programming language, created by sun microsystems and now owned by oracle corporation. google used the apis' definition and their structure, sequence and organization (sso) in creating the android to support the mobile device market. oracle had sued google in 2010 over both patent and copyright violations, but after two cycles, the case matter was narrowed down to whether google's use of the definition and sso of oracle's java apis (determined to be copyrightable) was within fair use. the federal circuit court of appeals has ruled against google, stating that while google could defend its use in the nature of the copyrighted work, its use was not transformative, and more significantly, it commercially harmed oracle as they were also seeking entry to the mobile market. the case, should this ruling hold, could have a significant impact on developing products for interoperability using apis, such as with many open source projects.
in april 2006, the filmmakers of the loose change series were served with a lawsuit by jules and gédéon naudet over the film's use of their footage, specifically footage of the firefighters discussing the collapse of the world trade center.
with the help of an intellectual property lawyer, the creators of loose change successfully argued that a majority of the footage used was for historical purposes and was significantly transformed in the context of the film. they agreed to remove a few shots that were used as b-roll and served no purpose to the greater discussion. the case was settled and a potential multimillion-dollar lawsuit was avoided.
this film is not yet rated also relied on fair use to feature several clips from copyrighted hollywood productions. the director had originally planned to license these clips from their studio owners but discovered that studio licensing agreements would have prohibited him from using this material to criticize the entertainment industry. this prompted him to invoke the fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material to provide analysis and criticism of published works.
in 2009, fair use appeared as a defense in lawsuits against filesharing. charles nesson argued that file-sharing qualifies as fair use in his defense of alleged filesharer joel tenenbaum. kiwi camara, defending alleged filesharer jammie thomas, announced a similar defense.
however, the court in the case at bar rejected the idea that file-sharing is fair use.
a u.s. court case from 2003, "kelly v. arriba soft corp.," provides and develops the relationship between thumbnails, inline linking and fair use. in the lower district court case on a motion for summary judgment, arriba soft's use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from kelly's website in arriba soft's image search engine was found not to be fair use. that decision was appealed and contested by internet rights activists such as the electronic frontier foundation, who argued that it was fair use.
on appeal, the ninth circuit court of appeals found in favour of the defendant, arriba soft. in reaching its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. first, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting that they were not meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. third, although normally making a "full" replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. to the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. in looking at all these factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on july 7, 2003. the remaining issues were resolved with a default judgment after arriba soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.
in august 2008, judge jeremy fogel of the northern district of california ruled in "lenz v. universal music corp." that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected "fair use" of the copyrighted material. the case involved stephanie lenz, a writer and editor from gallitzin, pennsylvania, who made a home video of her thirteen-month-old son dancing to prince's song let's go crazy and posted the video on youtube. four months later, universal music, the owner of the copyright to the song, ordered youtube to remove the video under the digital millennium copyright act. lenz notified youtube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and she demanded that it be restored. youtube complied after six weeks, rather than the two weeks required by the digital millennium copyright act. lenz then sued universal music in california for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song. on appeal, the court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that a copyright owner must affirmatively consider whether the complained of conduct constituted fair use before sending a takedown notice under the digital millennium copyright act, rather than waiting for the alleged infringer to assert fair use. 801 f.3d 1126 (9th cir. 2015). "even if, as universal urges, fair use is classified as an 'affirmative defense,' we hold—for the purposes of the dmca—fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. we conclude that because 17 u.s.c. § 107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is "authorized by the law" and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)."
in june 2011, judge philip pro of the district of nevada ruled in "righthaven v. hoehn" that the posting of an entire editorial article from the las vegas review journal in a comment as part of an online discussion was unarguably fair use. judge pro noted that "noncommercial, nonprofit use is presumptively fair. ... hoehn posted the work as part of an online discussion. ... this purpose is consistent with comment, for which 17 u.s.c. § 107 provides fair use protection. ... it is undisputed that hoehn posted the entire work in his comment on the website. ... wholesale copying does not preclude a finding of fair use. ... there is no genuine issue of material fact that hoehn's use of the work was fair and summary judgment is appropriate." on appeal, the court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that righthaven did not even have the standing needed to sue hoehn for copyright infringement in the first place.
in addition to considering the four fair use factors, courts deciding fair use cases also look to the standards and practices of the professional community where the case comes from. among the communities are documentarians, librarians, makers of open courseware, visual art educators, and communications professors.
such codes of best practices have permitted communities of practice to make more informed risk assessments in employing fair use in their daily practice. for instance, broadcasters, cablecasters, and distributors typically require filmmakers to obtain errors and omissions insurance before the distributor will take on the film. such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. before the "documentary filmmakers' statement of best practices in fair use" was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. this meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. in many cases, it was impossible to license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the u.s. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.
before 1991, sampling in certain genres of music was accepted practice and the copyright considerations were viewed as largely irrelevant. the strict decision against rapper biz markie's appropriation of a gilbert o'sullivan song in the case "grand upright music, ltd. v. warner bros. records inc." changed practices and opinions overnight. samples now had to be licensed, as long as they rose "to a level of legally cognizable appropriation." this left the door open for the "de minimis" doctrine, for short or unrecognizable samples; such uses would not rise to the level of copyright infringement, because under the "de minimis" doctrine, "the law does not care about trifles." however, 3 years later, the sixth circuit effectively eliminated the "de minimis" doctrine in the "bridgeport music, inc. v. dimension films" case, holding that artists must "get a license or do not sample". the court later clarified that its opinion did not apply to fair use, but between "grand upright" and "bridgeport", practice had effectively shifted to eliminate unlicensed sampling.
producers or creators of parodies of a copyrighted work have been sued for infringement by the targets of their ridicule, even though such use may be protected as fair use. these fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and satire, or comment on something else. courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.
for example, when tom forsythe appropriated barbie dolls for his photography project "food chain barbie" (depicting several copies of the doll naked and disheveled and about to be baked in an oven, blended in a food mixer, and the like), mattel lost its copyright infringement lawsuit against him because his work effectively parodies barbie and the values she represents. in "rogers v. koons", jeff koons tried to justify his appropriation of art rogers' photograph "puppies" in his sculpture "string of puppies" with the same parody defense. koons lost because his work was not presented as a parody of rogers' photograph in particular, but as a satire of society at large. this was insufficient to render the use fair.
in "campbell v. acuff-rose music inc" the u.s. supreme court recognized parody as a potential fair use, even when done for profit. roy orbison's publisher, acuff-rose music, had sued 2 live crew in 1989 for their use of orbison's "oh, pretty woman" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. the supreme court viewed 2 live crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than mere advertising, commercial nature did not bar the defense. the "campbell" court also distinguished parodies from satire, which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.
a number of appellate decisions have recognized that a parody may be a protected fair use, including the second ("leibovitz v. paramount pictures corp."); the ninth ("mattel v. walking mountain productions"); and the eleventh circuits ("suntrust bank v. houghton mifflin co."). in the 2001 "suntrust bank" case, suntrust bank and the margaret mitchell estate unsuccessfully brought suit to halt the publication of "the wind done gone", which reused many of the characters and situations from "gone with the wind" but told the events from the point of view of the enslaved people rather than the slaveholders. the eleventh circuit, applying "campbell", found that "the wind done gone" was fair use and vacated the district court's injunction against its publication.
cases in which a satirical use was found to be fair include "blanch v. koons" and "williams v. columbia broadcasting systems".
the transformative nature of computer based analytical processes such as text mining, web mining and data mining has led many to form the view that such uses would be protected under fair use. this view was substantiated by the rulings of judge denny chin in "authors guild, inc. v. google, inc.", a case involving mass digitisation of millions of books from research library collections. as part of the ruling that found the book digitisation project was fair use, the judge stated "google books is also transformative in the sense that it has transformed book text into data for purposes of substantive research, including data mining and text mining in new areas".
text and data mining was subject to further review in "authors guild v. hathitrust", a case derived from the same digitization project mentioned above. judge harold baer, in finding that the defendant's uses were transformative, stated that 'the search capabilities of the [hathitrust digital library] have already given rise to new methods of academic inquiry such as text mining."
there is a substantial body of fair use law regarding reverse engineering of computer software, hardware, network protocols, encryption and access control systems.
in may 2015, richard prince displayed his art gallery at the frieze art fair. his gallery consisted of screenshots of instagram users' pictures with prince's commentary photoshopped below in the comments section. not one instagram user authorized prince to use their pictures, but because prince added his own commentary, the pictures were considered original artwork. one of the pieces sold for $90,000. further, the gagosian gallery, where the pictures were showcased, stated that "all images are subject to copyright."
while u.s. fair use law has been influential in some countries, some countries have fair use criteria drastically different from those in the u.s., and some countries do not have a fair use framework at all. some countries have the concept of fair dealing instead of fair use, while others use different systems of limitations and exceptions to copyright. many countries have some reference to an exemption for educational use, though the extent of this exemption varies widely.
sources differ on whether fair use is fully recognized by countries other than the united states. american university's "infojustice.org" published a compilation of portions of over 40 nations' laws that explicitly mention fair use or fair dealing, and asserts that some of the fair dealing laws, such as canada's, have evolved (such as through judicial precedents) to be quite close to those of the united states. this compilation includes fair use provisions from bangladesh, israel, south korea, the philippines, sri lanka, taiwan, uganda, and the united states. however, paul geller's 2009 "international copyright law and practice" says that while some other countries recognize similar exceptions to copyright, only the united states and israel fully recognize the concept of fair use.
in november 2007, the israeli knesset passed a new copyright law that included a u.s.-style fair use exception. the law, which took effect in may 2008, permits the fair use of copyrighted works for purposes such as private study, research, criticism, review, news reporting, quotation, or instruction or testing by an educational institution. the law sets up four factors, similar to the u.s. fair use factors (see above), for determining whether a use is fair.
on september 2, 2009, the tel aviv district court ruled in "the football association premier league ltd. v. ploni" that fair use is a user right. the court also ruled that streaming of live soccer games on the internet is fair use. in doing so, the court analyzed the four fair use factors adopted in 2007 and cited u.s. case law, including "kelly v. arriba soft corp." and "perfect 10, inc. v. amazon.com, inc.".
an amendment in 2012 to the section 13(2)(a) of the copyright act 1987 created an exception called 'fair dealing' which is not restricted in its purpose. the four factors for fair use as specified in us law are included.
fair use exists in polish law and is covered by the polish copyright law articles 23 to 35.
compared to the united states, polish fair use distinguishes between private and public use. in poland, when the use is public, its use risks fines. the defendant must also prove that his use was private when accused that it was not, or that other mitigating circumstances apply. finally, polish law treats all cases in which private material was made public as a potential copyright infringement, where fair use can apply, but has to be proven by reasonable circumstances.
section 35 of the singaporean copyright act 1987 has been amended in 2004 to allow a 'fair dealing' exception for any purpose. the four fair use factors similar to us law are included in the new section 35.
the korean copyright act was amended to include a fair use provision, article 35-3, in 2012. the law outlines a four-factor test similar to that used under u.s. law:
fair dealing allows specific exceptions to copyright protections. the open-ended concept of fair use is generally not observed in jurisdictions where fair dealing is in place, although this does vary. fair dealing is established in legislation in australia, canada, new zealand, singapore, india, south africa and the united kingdom, among others.
while australian copyright exceptions are based on the fair dealing system, since 1998 a series of australian government inquiries have examined, and in most cases recommended, the introduction of a "flexible and open" fair use system into australian copyright law. from 1998 to 2017 there have been eight australian government inquiries which have considered the question of whether fair use should be adopted in australia. six reviews have recommended australia adopt a "fair use" model of copyright exceptions: two enquiries specifically into the copyright act (1998, 2014); and four broader reviews (both 2004, 2013, 2016). one review (2000) recommended against the introduction of fair use and another (2005) issued no final report. two of the recommendations were specifically in response to the stricter copyright rules introduced as part of the australia–united states free trade agreement (ausfta), while the most recent two, by the australian law reform commission (alrc) and the productivity commission (pc) were with reference to strengthening australia's "digital economy".
the "copyright act of canada" establishes fair dealing in canada, which allows specific exceptions to copyright protection. in 1985, the sub-committee on the revision of copyright rejected replacing fair dealing with an open-ended system, and in 1986 the canadian government agreed that "the present fair dealing provisions should not be replaced by the substantially wider 'fair use' concept". since then, the canadian fair dealing exception has broadened. it is now similar in effect to u.s. fair use, even though the frameworks are different.
cch canadian ltd v. law society of upper canada [2004] 1 s.c.r. 339, is a landmark supreme court of canada case that establishes the bounds of fair dealing in canadian copyright law. the law society of upper canada was sued for copyright infringement for providing photocopy services to researchers. the court unanimously held that the law society's practice fell within the bounds of fair dealing.
within the united kingdom, fair dealing is a legal doctrine that provides an exception to the nation's copyright law in cases where the copyright infringement is for the purposes of non-commercial research or study, criticism or review, or for the reporting of current events.
a balanced copyright law provides an economic benefit to many high-tech businesses such as search engines and software developers. fair use is also crucial to non-technology industries such as insurance, legal services, and newspaper publishers.
on september 12, 2007, the computer and communications industry association (ccia), a group representing companies including google inc., microsoft inc., oracle corporation, sun microsystems, yahoo! and other high-tech companies, released a study that found that fair use exceptions to us copyright laws were responsible for more than $4.5 trillion in annual revenue for the united states economy representing one-sixth of the total us gdp. the study was conducted using a methodology developed by the world intellectual property organization.
the study found that fair use dependent industries are directly responsible for more than eighteen percent of us economic growth and nearly eleven million american jobs. "as the united states economy becomes increasingly knowledge-based, the concept of fair use can no longer be discussed and legislated in the abstract. it is the very foundation of the digital age and a cornerstone of our economy," said ed black, president and ceo of ccia. "much of the unprecedented economic growth of the past ten years can actually be credited to the doctrine of fair use, as the internet itself depends on the ability to use content in a limited and unlicensed manner."
fair use week is an international event that celebrates fair use and fair dealing. fair use week was first proposed on a fair use allies listserv, which was an outgrowth of the library code of best practices capstone event, celebrating the development and promulgation of arl's "code of best practices in fair use for academic and research libraries". while the idea was not taken up nationally, copyright advisor at harvard university, launched the first ever fair use week at harvard university in february 2014, with a full week of activities celebrating fair use. the first fair use week included blog posts from national and international fair use experts, live fair use panels, fair use workshops, and a fair use stories tumblr blog, where people from the world of art, music, film, and academia shared stories about the importance of fair use to their community. the first fair use week was so successful that in 2015 arl teamed up with courtney and helped organize the second annual fair use week, with participation from many more institutions. arl also launched an official fair use week website, which was transferred from pia hunter, who attended the library code of best practices capstone event and had originally purchased the domain name fairuseweek.org.

a flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air. the term "flying car" is also sometimes used to include hovercars.
many prototypes have been built since the first years of the twentieth century using a variety of flight technologies and some have true vtol performance, but no flying car has yet reached production status.
their appearance is often predicted by futurologists, with their failure ever to reach production leading to the catchphrase, "where's my flying car?"
flying cars are also a popular theme in fantasy and science fiction stories.
in 1926, henry ford displayed an experimental single-seat aeroplane that he called the "sky flivver". the project was abandoned two years later when a distance-record attempt flight crashed, killing the pilot. the flivver was not a flying car at all, but it did get press attention at the time, exciting the public that they would have a mass-produced affordable airplane product that would be made, marketed, sold, and maintained just like an automobile. the airplane was to be as commonplace in the future as the model t of the time.
in 1940, henry ford famously predicted: "mark my word: a combination airplane and motorcar is coming. you may smile, but it will come.”
in 1942, the soviet armed forces experimented with a gliding tank, the antonov a-40, but it was not capable of flying on its own.
the aerocar designed and built by molt taylor made a successful flight in december 1949, and in following years versions underwent a series of road and flying tests. chuck berry featured the concept in his 1956 song "you can't catch me", and in december 1956 the civil aviation authority approved the design for mass production, but despite wide publicity and an improved version produced in 1989, taylor did not succeed in getting the flying car into production.
in the period between 1956-1958, ford's advanced design studio built the volante tri-athodyne, a 3/8 scale concept car model. it was designed to have three ducted fans, each with their own motor, that would lift it off the ground and move it through the air. in public relation release, ford noted that "the day where there will be an aero-car in every garage is still some time off", but added that "the volante indicates one direction that the styling of such a vehicle would take".
in 1957, popular mechanics reported that hiller helicopters was developing a ducted-fan aircraft that would be easier to fly than helicopters, and should cost a lot less. hiller engineers expected that this type of an aircraft would become the basis for a whole family of special-purpose aircraft.
in 1956, the us army's transportation research command began an investigation into "flying jeeps", ducted-fan-based aircraft that were envisioned to be smaller and easier to fly than helicopters. in 1957, chrysler, curtiss-wright, and piasecki were assigned contracts for building and delivery of prototypes. they all delivered their prototypes; however, piasecki's vz-8 was the most successful of the three. while it would normally operate close to the ground, it was capable of flying to several thousand feet, proving to be stable in flight. nonetheless, the army decided that the "flying jeep concept [was] unsuitable for the modern battlefield", and concentrated on the development of conventional helicopters. in addition to the army contract, piasecki was developing the sky car, a modified version of its vz-8 for civilian use.
in the mid-1980s, former boeing engineer, fred barker, founded flight innovations inc. and began the development of the sky commuter, a small duct fans-based vtol aircraft. it was a compact, two-passenger and was made primarily of composite materials. in 2008, the remaining prototype was sold for £86k on ebay.
as of 2016, aeromobil was test-flying a prototype that obtained slovak ultralight certification. when the final product will be available or how much it will cost is not yet specified. in 2018, it unveiled a concept that resembled a flying sportscar with vtol capabilty.
urban aeronautics' x-hawk is a vtol turbojet powered aircraft announced in 2006 with a first flight planned for 2009. it was intended to operate much like a tandem rotor helicopter, but with ducted fans rather than exposed rotors. the requisite decrease in rotor size would also decrease fuel efficiency. the x-hawk was being promoted for rescue and utility functions. as of 2013, no flights had been reported.
terrafugia have a flying road vehicle, the terrafugia transition on 7 may 2013, terrafugia announced the tf-x, a plug-in hybrid tilt-rotor vehicle that would be the first fully autonomous flying car. it would have a range of per flight and batteries are rechargeable by the engine. development of tf-x is expected to last 8–12 years, which means it will not come to market before 2019.
the moller skycar m400 is a prototype personal vtol (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft which is powered by four pairs of in-tandem wankel rotary engines, and is approaching the problems of satellite-navigation, incorporated in the proposed small aircraft transportation system. moller also advises that, currently, the skycar would only be allowed to fly from airports & heliports. the skycar m400 has tiny wheels and no road capability at all. moller has been developing vtol craft since the late 1960s, but no moller vehicle has ever achieved free flight out of ground effect. the proposed autovolantor model has an all-electric version powered by altairnano batteries.
the xplorair px200 was a french project of single-seater vtol aircraft without rotating airfoil, relying on the coandă effect and using an array of small jet engines called "thermoreactors" embedded within tiltwings' body. announced in 2007, the project has been funded by the government of france and was supported by various aerospace firms. a full-scale drone was scheduled for flight at paris air show 2017, followed by the commercialization of a single-seater flying car in the years after.
the skyrider x2r is a prototype of a flying car developed by macro industries, inc. it is lighter than the moller skycar which has never successfully flown untethered.
also notable is the roadable aircraft pal-v liberty, which is an autogyro or gyrocopter that can be taken to the road, too.
zee.aero and kitty hawk corporation are developing flying cars.
flying cars were planned to enter russian market in 2018. ride-sharing giant uber is working on the electric ecrm-003 evtol, with first tests expected by 2020, and very limited uberair service trials by 2023 (los angeles, dallas-fort worth, and melbourne), with 50 vehicles serving five skyports per city.
a practical flying car must be capable of safe, reliable and environmentally-friendly operation both on public roads and in the air. for widespread adoption it must also be able to fly without a qualified pilot at the controls and come at affordable purchase and running costs.
many types of aircraft technologies and form factors have been tried. the simplest and earliest approach was to give a driveable car added, bolt-on fixed flying surfaces and propeller. however, such a design must either tow its removable parts on a separate trailer behind it or return to its last landing point before taking off again. other conventional takeoff fixed-wing designs include folding wings, which the car carries with it when driven on the road.
vertical takeoff and landing (vtol) designs include rotorcraft with folding blades, as well as ducted-fan and tiltrotor vehicles. most design concepts have inherent problems. ducted-fan aircraft such as the moller skycar tend to easily lose stability and have been unable to travel at greater than 30–40 knots. tiltrotors, such as the v-22 osprey convertiplane, are generally noisy. to date, no vertical takeoff and landing (vtol) vehicle has ever demonstrated adequate road capabilities.
the autogyro has an unpowered lifting rotor, relying on its forward airspeed to generate lift. for road use it requires a folding rotor. designs such as the pal-v are currently being explored.
although statistically, commercial flying is much safer than driving, unlike commercial planes personal flying cars might not have as many safety checks and their pilots would not be as well trained. humans already have problems with the aspect of driving in two dimensions (forward and backwards, side to side), adding in the up and down aspect would make "driving" or flying as it would be, much more difficult; however, this problem might be solved via the sole use of self-flying and self-driving cars. in mid-air collisions and mechanical failures, the aircraft could fall from the sky or go through an emergency landing, resulting in deaths and property damage. in addition, poor weather conditions, such as low air density, lightning storms and heavy rain, snow or fog could be challenging and affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.
a major problem, which increases rapidly with wider adoption, is the risk of mid-air collisions. another is the unscheduled or emergency landing of a flying car on an unprepared location beneath, including the possibility of accident debris. regulatory regimes are being developed in anticipation of a large increase in the numbers of roadable aircraft and personal air vehicles in the near future, and compliance with these regimes will be necessary for safe flight.
mechanically, the challenges of flight are so strict that every opportunity must be taken to keep weight to a minimum and a typical airframe is lightweight and easily damaged. on the other hand a road vehicle must be able to withstand significant impact loads from casual incidents as well as low-speed and high-speed impacts, and the high strength this demands can add considerable weight. a practical flying car must be both strong enough to pass road safety standards and light enough to fly.
a flying car capable of widespread use must operate safely within a heavily populated urban environment. the lift and propulsion systems must be quiet, and have safety shrouds around all moving parts such as rotors, and must not create excessive pollution.
a basic flying car requires the person at the controls to be both a qualified road driver and aircraft pilot. this is impractical for the majority of people and so wider adoption will require computer systems to de-skill piloting. these include aircraft maneuvering, navigation and emergency procedures, all in potentially crowded airspace. fly-by-wire computers can also make up for many deficiencies in flight dynamics, such as stability. a practical flying car may need to be a fully autonomous vehicle in which people are present only as passengers.
the need for the propulsion system to be both small and powerful can at present only be met using advanced and expensive technologies. the cost of manufacture could therefore be as much as 10 million dollars.
flying cars would be used for shorter distances, at higher frequency, and at lower speeds and lower altitudes than conventional passenger aircraft. however optimal fuel efficiency for airplanes is obtained at high altitudes and high subsonic speeds, so a flying car's energy efficiency would be low compared to a conventional aircraft. similarly, the flying car's road performance would be compromised by the requirements of flight, so it would be less economical than a conventional motor car as well.
the minimum initial cost of flying cars will be in excess of $200,000, which can also exceed $1,000,000 as in the case of aeromobil.the higher initial cost could be attributed to the manufacturer recovering cost for r&d, certification ,production tooling and raw materials. the higher price will have a negative impact on sales, limiting the initial market to individuals or organizations with deep pockets.
the flying car was and remains a common feature of conceptions of the future, including imagined near futures such as those of the 21st century.
in 1999 the u.s. journalist gail collins noted:
as a result, flying cars have been referred to jokingly with the question "where's my flying car?", emblematic of the supposed failure of modern technology to match futuristic visions that were promoted in earlier decades.
aired on 8 january 1998, "seinfeld"'s 167th episode, "the dealership", featured george and jerry complaining about the non-existence of the flying cars. jerry says, "it's like we're living in the '50s here."
a 2001 ibm television commercial featured avery brooks complaining, "it is the year 2000, but where are the flying cars? i was promised flying cars. i don’t see any flying cars. why? why? why?"
comedian lewis black had a similar routine early in the decade, in which he says, "this new millennium sucks! it's exactly the same as the old millennium! you know why? no flying cars!"
"the flying car"' was a comedy short film written by kevin smith in 2002 for "the tonight show with jay leno". it featured dante hicks and randal graves stuck in traffic, discussing the lengths to which a man might go to obtain such a vehicle.
in 2008, "onion news network"s 245th episode, titled "mean automakers dash nation's hope for flying cars", featured the onion's anchor brandon armstrong humorously arguing about the feasibility and existence of flying cars with representatives from general motors, toyota and ford.
the flying car has been depicted in many works of fantasy and science fiction.

abdülaziz (ottoman turkish: عبد العزيز / "`abdü’l-`azīz", ; 8 february 18304 june 1876) was the 32nd sultan of the ottoman empire and reigned between 25 june 1861 and 30 may 1876. he was the son of sultan mahmud ii and succeeded his brother abdulmejid i in 1861.
born at eyüp palace, constantinople (present-day istanbul), on 8 february 1830, abdülaziz received an ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the west. he was the first ottoman sultan who travelled to western europe, visiting a number of important european capitals including paris, london and vienna in the summer of 1867.
apart from his passion for the ottoman navy, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the british and french navies), the sultan took an interest in documenting the ottoman empire. he was also interested in literature and was a talented classical music composer. some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the ottoman dynasty, have been collected in the album ""european music at the ottoman court"" by the london academy of ottoman court music. he was deposed on grounds of mismanaging the ottoman economy on 30 may 1876, and was found dead six days later under unnatural and mysterious circumstances.
his parents were mahmud ii and pertevniyal sultan (1812–1883), originally named besime, a circassian. in 1868 pertevniyal was residing at dolmabahçe palace. that year abdülaziz led the visiting eugénie de montijo, empress of france, to see his mother. pertevniyal perceived the presence of a foreign woman within her quarters of the seraglio as an insult. she reportedly slapped eugénie across the face, almost resulting in an international incident. according to another account, pertevniyal became outraged by the forwardness of eugénie taking the arm of one of her sons while he gave a tour of the palace garden, and she gave the empress a slap on the stomach as a possibly more subtly intended than often represented reminder that they were not in france. the pertevniyal valide sultan mosque was built under the patronage of his mother. the construction work began in november 1869 and the mosque was finished in 1871.
his paternal grandparents were sultan abdul hamid i and sultana nakşidil sultan. several accounts identify his paternal grandmother with aimée du buc de rivéry, a cousin of empress joséphine. pertevniyal was a sister of khushiyar qadin, third wife of ibrahim pasha of egypt. khushiyar and ibrahim were the parents of isma'il pasha.
between 1861 and 1871, the tanzimat reforms which began during the reign of his brother abdulmejid i were continued under the leadership of his chief ministers, mehmed fuad pasha and mehmed emin âli pasha. new administrative districts ("vilayets") were set up in 1864 and a council of state was established in 1868. public education was organized on the french model and istanbul university was reorganised as a modern institution in 1861. he was also integral in establishing the first ottoman civil code.
abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the second french empire and the british empire. in 1867 he was the first ottoman sultan to visit western europe; his trip included a visit to the exposition universelle (1867) in paris and a trip to the united kingdom, where he was made a knight of the garter by queen victoria and shown a royal navy fleet review with ismail pasha. he travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the rahmi m. koç museum in istanbul. his fellow knights of the garter created in 1867 were charles gordon-lennox, 6th duke of richmond, charles manners, 6th duke of rutland, henry somerset, 8th duke of beaufort, prince arthur, duke of connaught and strathearn (a son of queen victoria), franz joseph i of austria and alexander ii of russia.
also in 1867, abdülaziz became the first ottoman sultan to formally recognize the title of khedive (viceroy) to be used by the vali (governor) of the ottoman eyalet of egypt and sudan (1517–1867), which thus became the autonomous ottoman khedivate of egypt and sudan (1867–1914). muhammad ali pasha and his descendants had been the governors (vali) of ottoman egypt and sudan since 1805, but were willing to use the higher title of khedive, which was unrecognized by the ottoman government until 1867. in return, the first khedive, ismail pasha, had agreed a year earlier (in 1866) to increase the annual tax revenues which egypt and sudan would provide for the ottoman treasury. between 1854 and 1894, the revenues from egypt and sudan were often declared as a surety by the ottoman government for borrowing loans from british and french banks. after the ottoman government declared a sovereign default on its foreign debt repayments on 30 october 1875, which triggered the great eastern crisis in the empire's balkan provinces that led to the devastating russo-turkish war (1877–78) and the establishment of the ottoman public debt administration in 1881, the importance for britain of the sureties regarding the ottoman revenues from egypt and sudan increased. combined with the much more important suez canal which was opened in 1869, these sureties were influential in the british government's decision to occupy egypt and sudan in 1882, with the pretext of helping the ottoman-egyptian government to put down the urabi revolt (1879–1882). egypt and sudan (together with cyprus) nominally remained ottoman territories until 5 november 1914, when the british empire declared war against the ottoman empire during world war i.
in 1869, abdülaziz received visits from eugénie de montijo, empress consort of napoleon iii of france and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the suez canal. the prince of wales, the future edward vii, twice visited istanbul.
by 1871 both mehmed fuad pasha and mehmed emin âli pasha were dead. the second french empire, his western european model, had been defeated in the franco-prussian war by the north german confederation under the leadership of the kingdom of prussia. abdülaziz turned to the russian empire for friendship, as unrest in the balkan provinces continued. in 1875, the herzegovinian rebellion was the beginning of further unrest in the balkan provinces. in 1876, the april uprising saw insurrection spreading among the bulgarians. ill feeling mounted against russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.
while no one event led to his being deposed, the crop failure of 1873 and his lavish expenditures on the ottoman navy and on new palaces which he had built, along with mounting public debt, helped to create an atmosphere conducive to his being overthrown. abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 may 1876.
abdülaziz's death at çırağan palace in istanbul a few days later was documented as a suicide at the time, but suspicions of murder promptly erupted.
in sultan abdulhamid ii's recently surfaced memoirs, the event is described as an assassination by the order of hüseyin avni pasha and midhat pasha. according to this source, when sultan murad v began to show signs of paranoia, madness and continuous fainting and vomiting even on the day of his coronation and threw himself into a pool yelling at his guards to protect his life, they were afraid the public would become outraged and revolt to bring the former sultan back. within a few days, on 4 june 1876, they arranged for sultan abdülaziz to kill himself with scissors, cutting his wrists.
on the morning of june 5, abdülaziz asked for a pair of scissors with which to trim his beard. shortly after this he was found dead in a pool of blood flowing from two wounds in his arms. his body was examined by 17 physicians ("dr. marco, nouri, a. sotto, physician attached to the imperial and royal embassy of austria‐hungary; dr. spagnolo, marc markel, jatropoulo, abdinour, servet, j. de castro, a. marroin, julius millingen, c. caratheodori; e. d. dickson, physician of the british embassy; dr. o. vitalis, physician of the sanitary board; dr. e. spadare, j. nouridjian, miltiadi bey, mustafa, mehmed") who certified that the death had been “caused by the loss of blood produced by the wounds of the blood‐vessels at the joints of the arms” and that “the direction and nature of the wounds, together with the instrument which is said to have produced them, lead us to conclude that suicide had been committed.”
one of those physicians also stated that “his skin was very pale, and entirely free from bruises, marks or spots of any kind whatever. there was no lividity of the lips indicating suffocation nor any sign of pressure having been applied to the throat.” . this is corroborated by reports that officers, on the orders of hüseyin avni pasha and midhat pasha, attempted to overpower abdulaziz, however given that he was a champion wrestler were unable to, resorting to the use of a blade.
abdülaziz had one another daughter whose mother is unknown:

abdera was an ancient carthaginian and roman port on a hill above the modern adra on the southeastern mediterranean coast of spain. it was located between malaca (now málaga) and carthago nova (now cartagena) in the district inhabited by the bastuli.
abdera shares its name with a city in thrace and another in north africa. its coins bore the inscription (). the first element in the name appears to be the punic word for "servant" or "slave"; the second element seems shared by the phoenician names for agadir (now cadiz) and cythera but of unclear meaning.
it appears in greek sources as "tà ábdēra" () and "aúdēra" (), "ábdara" (), and "tò ábdēron" ().
it was founded by the carthaginians as a trading station and, after a period of decline, became one of the more important towns in the roman province of hispania baetica.
tiberius seems to have made the place a roman colony.
the most ancient coins bear its name with the head of melqart and a tuna. coins from the time of tiberius show the town's main temple with two erect tunas as its columns. early roman coins were bilingual with latin inscriptions on one side stating the name of the emperor and the town and with punic text on the other side simply stating the name of the town.

abdera is a municipality and a former major greek "polis" on the coast of thrace.
the ancient polis is to be distinguished from the municipality, which was named in its honor. the polis lay 17 km east-northeast of the mouth of the nestos river, almost directly opposite the island of thasos. it was a colony placed in previously unsettled thracian territory, not then a part of hellas, during the age of greek colonization. the city that developed from it became of major importance in ancient greece. after the 4th century it declined, contracted to its acropolis, and was abandoned, never to be reoccupied except by archaeologists.
meanwhile, life went on as the changing population settled in other communities in the region. one named polystylus changed its name to abdera. in 2011 the municipality of abdera was synoecized from three previous municipalities comprising a number of modern settlements. the ancient site remains in it as a ruin. it now lies in the xanthi regional unit of thrace, greece. the municipality of abdera has 19,005 inhabitants (2011). the seat of the municipality is the town genisea.
the name "abdera" is a phoenician one, shared in antiquity by a town in spain and another in north africa. it was variously hellenized as "ábdēra" (), "ábdēron" (), and "ábdēros" () before being latinized as "abdera". (unusually, it was declined as a 2nd-declension masculine noun despite having a terminal "a".) greek legend attributed the name to an eponymous "abderus" who fell nearby and was memorialized by hercules's founding of a city at the location.
the present-day town is written avdira () and pronounced in modern greek.
the phoenicians apparently began the settlement of abdera at some point before the mid-7th century and the town long maintained phoenician standards in its coinage.
the greek settlement was begun as a failed colony from klazomenai, traditionally dated to 654. (evidence in 7th-century- greek pottery tends to support the traditional date but the exact timing remains uncertain.) herodotus reports that the leader of the colony had been timesios but, within his generation, the thracians had expelled the colonists. timesios was subsequently honored as a local protective spirit by the later abderans from teos. others recount various legends about this colony. plutarch and aelian relate that timesios grew insufferable to his colonists because of his desire to do everything by himself; when one of their children let him know how they all really felt, he quit the settlement in disgust; modern scholars have tried to split the difference between the two accounts of early abdera's failure by giving the latter as the reason for timesios's having left klazomenai.
the successful foundation occurred in 544bc, when the majority of the people of teos (including the poet anacreon) migrated to abdera to escape the persian yoke. the chief coin type, a "griffon", is identical with that of teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.
in 513 and 512, the persians, under darius conquered abdera, by which time the city seems to have become a place of considerable importance, and is mentioned as one of the cities which had the expensive honour of entertaining the great king on his march into greece. in 492, after the ionian revolt, the persians again conquered abdera, again under darius i but led by his general mardonius. on his flight after the battle of salamis, xerxes stopped at abdera and acknowledged the hospitality of its inhabitants by presenting them with a tiara and scimitar of gold. thucydides mentions abdera as the westernmost limit of the odrysian kingdom when at its height at the beginning of the peloponnesian war. it later became part of the delian league and fought on the side of athens in the peloponnesian war.
abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the league, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of thrace and the odrysian kingdom. in 408, abdera was reduced under the power of athens by thrasybulus, then one of the athenian generals in that quarter.
a valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the triballi in 376, philip ii of macedon in 350; later by lysimachos of thrace, the seleucids, the ptolemies, and again by the macedonians. in 170 the roman armies and those of eumenes ii of pergamon besieged and sacked it.
the town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century. cicero ridicules the city as a byword for stupidity in his letters to atticus, writing of a debate in the senate, "here was abdera, but i wasn't silent" ("hic, abdera non tacente me"). nevertheless, the city counted among its citizens the philosophers democritus, protagoras and anaxarchus, historian and philosopher hecataeus of abdera, and the lyric poet anacreon. pliny the elder speaks of abdera as being in his time a free city.
abdera had flourished especially in ancient times mainly for two reasons: because of the large area of their territory and their highly strategic position. the city controlled two great road passages (one of nestos river and other through the mountains north of xanthi). furthermore, from their ports passed the sea road, which from troas led to the thracian and then the macedonian coast.
the ruins of the town may still be seen on cape balastra (40°56'1.02"n 24°58'21.81"e); they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of polystylon.
the municipality abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of three former municipalities that became municipal units: abdera, selero, and vistonida.
the municipality has an area of 352.047 km, the municipal unit 161.958 km. the municipal unit abdera is subdivided into the communities abdera, mandra, myrodato and nea kessani. the community abdera consists of the settlements abdera, giona, lefkippos, pezoula and skala.
landmarks of abdera include the archaeological museum of abdera, and agios ioannis beach (also "paralia avdiron") near the village lefkippos.

apollos () was a 1st-century alexandrian jewish christian mentioned several times in the new testament. a contemporary and colleague of paul the apostle, he played an important role in the early development of the churches of ephesus and corinth.
apollos is first mentioned as a christian preacher who had come to ephesus (probably in ad 52 or 53), where he is described as "being fervent in spirit: he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning jesus, though he knew only the baptism of john". priscilla and aquila, a jewish christian couple who had come to ephesus with the apostle paul, instructed apollos:
the differences between the two understandings probably related to the christian baptism, since apollos "knew only the baptism of john". later, during apollos' absence, the writer of the acts of the apostles recounts an encounter between paul and some disciples at ephesus:
before paul's arrival, apollos had moved from ephesus to achaia and was living in corinth, the provincial capital of achaia. acts reports that apollos arrived in achaia with a letter of recommendation from the ephesian christians and "greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the jews in public, showing by the scriptures that the christ was jesus.
paul's first epistle to the corinthians (ad 55) mentions apollos as an important figure at corinth. paul describes apollos' role at corinth:
paul's epistle refers to a schism between four parties in the corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to paul and apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were peter, identified as cephas, and jesus christ himself). it is possible, though, that, as msgr. ronald knox suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow paul, the other claiming to follow apollos. "it is surely probable that the adherents of st. paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the apostolic college. hence 'i am for cephas'. [...] what reply was the faction of apollos to make? it devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the apostolic college itself to him from whom the apostolic college derived its dignity; 'i am for christ'." paul states that the schism arose because of the corinthians' immaturity in faith.
apollos was a devout jew born in alexandria. pope benedict xvi says that the name "apollos" was probably short for apollonius or apollodorus. apollos' origin in alexandria has led to speculations that he would have preached in the allegorical style of philo. theologian jerome murphy-o'connor, for example, commented: "it is difficult to imagine that an alexandrian jew ... could have escaped the influence of philo, the great intellectual leader ... particularly since the latter seems to have been especially concerned with education and preaching." pope benedict suggest there were those in corinth "...fascinated by his way of speaking..."
there is no indication that apollos favored or approved an overestimation of his person. paul urged him to go to corinth at the time, but apollos refused, stating that he would come later when he had an opportunity.
apollos is mentioned one more time in the new testament. in the epistle to titus, the recipient is exhorted to "speed zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way".
jerome states that apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at corinth that he retired to crete with zenas; and that once the schism had been healed by paul's letters to the corinthians, apollos returned to the city and became one of its elders. less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of duras, or of iconium in phrygia, or of caesarea.
martin luther and some modern scholars have proposed apollos as the author of the epistle to the hebrews, rather than paul or barnabas. both apollos and barnabas were jewish christians with sufficient intellectual authority. the pulpit commentary treats apollos' authorship of hebrews as "generally believed". other than this, there are no known surviving texts attributed to apollos.
apollos is regarded as a saint by several christian churches, including the lutheran church–missouri synod, which hold a commemoration for him, together with saints aquila and priscilla, on 13 february.

the community acquis or acquis communautaire (; ), sometimes called the eu acquis and often shortened to acquis, is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of european union law. the term is french: "acquis" meaning "that which has been acquired or obtained", and "communautaire" meaning "of the community".
during the process of the enlargement of the european union, the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the eu and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus romania and bulgaria which joined in 2007). these chapters were:
for the negotiations with croatia (which joined in 2013), iceland, turkey, montenegro, serbia and in the future, with north macedonia, albania (candidate countries), the acquis is split up into 35 chapters instead, with the purpose of better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process:
correspondence between chapters of the 5th and the 6th enlargement:
such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the european union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the "acquis".
the term "acquis" is also used to describe laws adopted under the schengen agreement, prior to its integration into the european union legal order by the treaty of amsterdam, in which case one speaks of the "schengen acquis".
the term "acquis" has been borrowed by the world trade organization appellate body, in the case "japan – taxes on alcoholic beverages", to refer to the accumulation of general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) and wto law (""acquis gattien""), though this usage is not well established.
it has been used to describe the achievements of the council of europe (an international organisation unconnected with the european union):
it has also been applied to the body of "principles, norms and commitments" of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce):
the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) introduced the concept of the oecd acquis in its "strategy for enlargement and outreach", may 2004.

an antacid is a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity and is used to relieve heartburn, indigestion or an upset stomach.
antacids are available over the counter and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional heartburn, the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease and also indigestion. treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms.
antacids are distinct from acid-reducing drugs like h-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors and they do not kill the bacteria "helicobacter pylori", which causes most ulcers.
non-particulate antacids (sodium citrate, magnesium trisilicate) increase gastric ph with little or no effect on gastric volume. sodium citrate should be given within 1 hour of surgery to be the most effective.
